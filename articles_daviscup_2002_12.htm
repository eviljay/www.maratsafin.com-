                  <a href="http://www.sportsmediainc.net/tennisweek/">sportsmediainc.net/tennisweek</a><br>

                  France selected clay as the surface for its Davis Cup final 
                  against Russia, which makes French Open semifinalist Marat Safin 
                  believe the Russians can bury the defending Davis Cup champions 
                  on the dirt in Paris. The Davis Cup final will be staged November 
                  29th-December 1st at the same Bercy arena that is currently 
                  hosting the BNP Paribas Masters on carpet.<br>
                  <br>
                  Questioning the choice of clay as the surface for the final, 
                  Safin suggested red clay is not conducive to the style of most 
                  French players and that France made the move in the mistaken 
                  belief the Russians were most vulnerable on clay.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I don't know why they chose the clay,&quot; Safin said. 
                  &quot;I think they are trying to use it against us, but it also 
                  doesn't suit them. They don't really have clay-court players. 
                  &quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  France's best clay-court player is Sebastien Grosjean, who reached 
                  the Roland Garros semifinals last year and advanced to the quarterfinals 
                  this year where Safin crushed him 6-3, 6-2, 6-2. <br>
                  <br>
                  With Paul-Henri Mathieu suffering from rib and abdominal injuries, 
                  French Davis Cup captain Guy Forget will likely select either 
                  Arnaud Clement or Nicolas Escude to join Grosjean as a singles 
                  starter. Neither player has enjoyed much success on clay: Escude 
                  is 4-7 lifetime at Roland Garros and was a first-round casualty 
                  to Fernando Meligeni this year, while Clement owns a 4-6 career 
                  mark at the French Open.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;(Sebastien) Grosjean, he can play on every surface, (Nicolas) 
                  Escude, he can play on clay, but he's dangerous on grass and 
                  fast indoor courts,&quot; Safin said. &quot;Clement, he can 
                  play , but we have the same Ч we have no problems playing on 
                  clay.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  The tournament runner-up on the red clay at the Tennis Masters 
                  Series-Hamburg in May, Safin is an accomplished clay-court player 
                  whose game was molded on the red clay of Valencia, Spain where 
                  he trained from the ages of 13 to 19 after moving from his native 
                  Moscow in seach of better facilities.<br>
                  <br>
                  The 22-year-old Safin is trying to help friend and teammate 
                  Yevgeny Kafelnikov conclude his career as a Davis Cup champion. 
                  Kafelnikov, who captured the French Open crown in 1996, has 
                  repeatedly stated his desire to retire should he help Russia 
                  win its first Davis Cup championship in history.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I'm getting a little bit tired of tennis and all the time 
                  being on the tour,&quot; Safin said. &quot;But (after Shanghai) 
                  we will have two weeks to prepare ourselves for the Davis Cup. 
                  I think we have a chance to win here in Paris. It would be a 
                  great present for myself and Yevgeny. If he wants to retire, 
                  then he can retire.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  While Safin insists the surface suits the Russians, French captain 
                  Forget may have been influenced by Kafelnikov's abysmal clay-court 
                  spring season as well as the fact that Safin can sometimes struggle 
                  against speedy counter-punchers such as Clement and Grosjean. 
                  The French may be hoping Safin will implode in impatience, but 
                  one objective observer Ч top-ranked Lleyton Hewitt, who was 
                  a member of Australia's 1999 Davis Cup championship squad &amp;151; 
                  said Safin is capable of carrying Russia to victory on clay.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Marat is such a great player he can win a tie off his 
                  own racquet,&quot; Hewitt said. &quot;But I'm sure Guy Forget 
                  is very happy with the squad he has got. I guess Grosjean is 
                  their only top 10 player, but you only have to look at how many 
                  guys could have got a wildcard here this week to know how strong 
                  the squad is. The slight advantage they've got is playing in 
                  France.&quot;<br>
