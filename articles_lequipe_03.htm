                  11.23.2002<br>
                  By Jean Issartel, in MOSCOW <br>
                  <br>
                  <em>Safin,exeptionally gifted,nonchalant and a symbol of liberal/modern 
                  Russia. Kafelnikov,established champion and a real product of 
                  the Communism. Cross portrait of two team-mates that everything 
                  separate. </em><br>
                  <br>
                  In order to know,in order to be sure,the best thing would be 
                  a head to head,in Moscow,in the huge Olympic Stadium.In such 
                  a case,we would see, as a radiograph of the Russian society, 
                  all the nostalgy and all the divides standing out a crowd who 
                  would probably cheer the eldest. <br>
                  <br>
                  By the way,Marat Safin has no illusions.And the idea of a match 
                  against YK made Marat laugh: &quot;Last year,the crowd hissed 
                  me, here, at home, because I had dificulties in finding my game. 
                  They put my head underwatter until I drowned myself. So I imagine 
                  easily that the crowd would support Evgueni if I had to play 
                  him here&quot;. <br>
                  <br>
                  And yet,he has everything to be popular ,Safin. <br>
                  He's young,exeptionally gifted, rich, nice, funny, tortured 
                  soul...He run his eyes and his disenchanted smile over the world 
                  around him and if sometimes he get angry with the journalists 
                  of his country &quot;It's only because they get on my nerves 
                  with their questions which all concern my private life and the 
                  external signs of my wealth&quot;. Also maybe he starts to be 
                  tired of playing ,despite his ranking and his results, the supporting 
                  part behind &quot;kafel&quot;,the idolized Olympic Champion, 
                  6 years older than him. <br>
                  <br>
                  Evgueni.His lengendary haircut,always looking busy,in a hurry. 
                  Never a smile,his words always come out as from a kalachnikov. 
                  &quot;People in Moscow,as everywhere in Russia,likes very much 
                  what I made as a tennisplayer.Winning 2 Grand Slams,being the 
                  number one in the world and above all winning the Olympic Gold 
                  Medal gave me a legitimacy and the respect of all Russian people. 
                  I am the 1st of all of them who made all those things. And when 
                  you're the 1st to do something,you're the 1st forever. People 
                  knows that I stole nothing and that I earned all what I have 
                  by the sweat of my brow,by my work,by my gift.It's a big honor 
                  to reach this level for me and for my country.I feel a lot of 
                  gratitude from my fellowcountymen. Above all, I feel that they 
                  identify themself to me,I feel that they know we lived the same 
                  things,the Communism with it's good and his bad sides. Me, I 
                  didn't leave the country to early. I am their champion,the one 
                  they could have been&quot;. <br>
                  <br>
                  Never being doubtful; a lot of ego and tons of certitudes. Modesty 
                  is just a front, a mask, an YK says that he never wears masks, 
                  &quot;exept to go dancing&quot;. Even when he said that,he didn't 
                  smile.&quot;I am more under pressure than Marat,here.I won the 
                  tourney 5 times in a row,like Bjцrn Borg in Wimbledon. People 
                  are expecting a 6th victory of me.I take my responsabilities. 
                  I am a man.I don't do that for Yevgueni Kafelnikov. I do that 
                  for my fans,for Russia.So, I play better than if it was only 
                  for myself&quot;. <br>
                  <br>
                  Of course when you read those words from Kafelnikov,only the 
                  arrogance stands out.By talking to him,the feeling is a bit 
                  different. <br>
                  YK is a king who distributes his words when and where he wants.He 
                  doesn't say always the truth,but the essential for him is to 
                  believe what he tells.He doesn't want to charm,he doesn't care 
                  about it.What he wants is to win the talk as you win a tennis 
                  match. Sometimes he is honest,like in a a respite,because of 
                  his taste for he game.Then,he doesn't deny his taste for money 
                  or his relationships,which outside Russia everybody consider 
                  guilty. &quot;Personally,I believe that I am well surrounded.I 
                  can rely on a few friends,and people who have networks that 
                  I need,and I'll use them more when I'll dedicated myself to 
                  my buisness and the Russian Tennis&quot;. <br>
                  <br>
                  The Mafia's shadow cast a shadow over the aura of the character, 
                  as it cast a shadow over Russia.YK maintains&quot;his country 
                  neither better nor worse than the others developped Nations, 
                  maybe Russia is just less hypocritical&quot;...Kafelnikov himself 
                  may passed from his own myth and the reality. He always has 
                  four bodyguards(2 in front of him and 2 behind him)with him.YK 
                  always speaks frankly exept when he is tired with the truth. 
                  In that case,he lies.He lies about his social roots for exemple.In 
                  moscow everybody will tell you that he comes from a very poor 
                  family and YK confirms that his father,a bad volleyball player, 
                  worked as a taxidriver in Sotchi during summer holidays; that 
                  is mother was a cleaning lady and that now YK meets them very 
                  rarely. <br>
                  <br>
                  But in the ATP's questionary that YK had copleted at the begining 
                  of his career on the ATP Tour,YK stated that is father Alexander 
                  was a volleyball coach at the University and that his mother 
                  had a High athlete level Status in the ex-USSR. <br>
                  <br>
                  Marat Safin made no secret about his family, neither about the 
                  rest. Anyway his parents are here,in the crowd for all his matches 
                  and for all Dinara's matches. Sometimes his mother made herself 
                  scarce in order to go to the mosque. At the mosque she has her 
                  friends and she buys meatballs as in her area in the Crimea. 
                  She doesn't want to attract the medias but she always accepts 
                  interwiews with a beautiful smile. Her husband acts as her,kindky. 
                  First he is shy ,but step by step he tells in a few words all 
                  the things which separate his son from YK: <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;YK is the last product of the soviet organsition of the 
                  Sport; Marat is the first tennis champion of the modern/liberal 
                  Russia. YK followed the classic/typical program and the Communist 
                  State helped him ; Marat started in the same way but the political 
                  upheavals meant we had to find a sponsor in order to finance 
                  his debut in the Tour. If Marat hadn't benifited from the help 
                  of a sponsor,he would not be where he is now&quot;. His wife 
                  interrupted him in order to clarify the unbelievable story of 
                  her kid : <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;When he was 13, Marat was one of the most talented young 
                  boys in Russia,but the Russian Tennis Federation hadn't any 
                  more money .And we hadn't enough money to finance all Marat's 
                  training. So I asked the help of a friiend,Vladimir Pavlovic 
                  Tcherbakov, the President of the Russian Labor Union. He found 
                  Bruce Rappaport, a swiss billionaire. We had never seen him. 
                  We just met his daugther once in order to help Dinara. Now this 
                  is a very current way of funding in Russia. But at the time,only 
                  Marat and Anna Kournikova benifited of this funding. The only 
                  difference with the communist way of financingb is very simple. 
                  Before,everything was paid but you were not free. As soon as 
                  you had bad results,it was the end and you didn't have the right 
                  to travel anymore. <br>
                  Today you almost can do what you want.There just one constraint: 
                  &quot;you must pay back&quot;.<br>
                  <br>
                  Marat paid back in 2001, that's why he played all those tournaments 
                  while he had a back injury , at the risk of his health and of 
                  his future on the tour. His mother explains:&quot; He paid all 
                  what he had to pay and he also paid Dinara's debt. It was better 
                  to pay quickly because the debt started to be exorbitant. It's 
                  like at the Bank,the more you wait to pay the more you have 
                  to pay expensive...&quot;. Yes, but there is a big diference 
                  between banks and private sponsorship. The private sponsors 
                  draw up contracts as they want. <br>
                  <br>
                  Yes, Marat Safin was right in paying his debt and his little 
                  sister's debt quickly...Now when he earns money,he earns money 
                  for himself. <br>
                  <br>
                  ...By the way YK, the symbol of the previous era has already 
                  marked out the good sides of today's disorganization, and although 
                  he hadn't need the help of a sponsor because the State helped 
                  him,YK took the decision to be a sponsor himself. From the side 
                  which pays/which is profitable. &quot;It is sure that today 
                  without help it's very hard to be succesful. But, I am sure 
                  that if a young player is talented and well surrounded,he can 
                  find a sponsor to help him/her. Me I sponsorized for 2 years 
                  a young Russian player,Maria Kirienko,who won the US Open. Some 
                  friends talked to me about her. I took this as a bet.I love 
                  betting,it tallies with my mentality&quot;. <br>
                  <br>
                  On the Tour, YK's fondness for the &quot;bets&quot; is very 
                  much commented.He earned a lot of money by speculating,notably 
                  in Germany.&quot;I like playing chess.In my life,in tennis, 
                  in my business it's like when I play chess. Sometimes I'm right,sometimes 
                  I'm wrong. If I had always been succesful in my buisiness, I 
                  would be the President of Russia! <br>
                  <br>
                  To calculate,to bet,to bet all on one buisiness,I love this 
                  shudder...but well,for the moment I stop all those activities 
                  in order to think about just one thing: the Davis Cup. After,I'll 
                  see&quot;. <br>
                  <br>
                  After.After the Tennis.YK has already a foot in this other life.His 
                  next job?An official, a self-employed,a reliable partner,a mad 
                  better...well in one word, he will revolve/move.For exemple 
                  he will move in the Russian Tennis,with his friend Shamil Tarpishev,the 
                  DC's team captain, the President of the Russian Tennis Federation, 
                  a buisinessman and one of the Kremlin Cup organizer who thinks 
                  that YK is &quot;the glorious past of the Russian Sport but 
                  also the glorious futur&quot;.Tarpishev,suspected of having 
                  misappropriated for his benefit some millions of dollars which 
                  were intented for the Russian Sport,says that he thinks he is 
                  &quot;YK's big brother&quot; and he describes YK as &quot;the 
                  product of the soviet organization,trained by our trainers,so 
                  he perfectly knows the strengths and the weaknesses of our organization&quot;. 
                  As an echo back, in front of Russian's journalists,Yevgueni 
                  answers cleverly that he meets Tarpishev only twice a year or 
                  three time a year. &quot;I owe my level in the Tennis to the 
                  education I received when I was 15. Now I want to give back 
                  to Russia what Russia gave to me ,by winning the DC and after 
                  by developing Tennis in our country&quot;. <br>
                  <br>
                  You can meet/see those people in Moscow at at a reception in 
                  honor of YK gave by Moscow's Mayor Youri Loujkov,intimate enemy 
                  of Boris Yeltsine who is by the way a big friend of YK.You can 
                  also meet them in the players lounge,they said that they are 
                  buisinessmen,sport's fans,official members of unofficial organizations. 
                  <br>
                  They make up the &quot;network&quot; that YK talks about,those 
                  famous &quot;connections in and outside Russia which are essentials 
                  to succeed in buisiness&quot;. <br>
                  <br>
                  Kafelnikov attracts them as much as Marat Safin applies himself 
                  to keep them at a distance.&quot;We have not the same friends&quot; 
                  pleads Safin. <br>
                  <br>
                  In fact, Marat and Yevgueni seem to avoid each other carefully. 
                  &quot;Well, I see him enouch on the tour,says the youngest. 
                  YK is my Davis Cup team-mate,period. We are not the same age,we 
                  do not feel interested in the same things in life. We attempt 
                  to not irritate each other. We are satisfied in playing together,we 
                  have a quite good relationship, we do our job... But after that,end 
                  of buisiness. Sometimes I see him in a bar, so we can have a 
                  drink, but that's all, nothing more. I don't know his life very 
                  much. <br>
                  <br>
                  Me I like to sit down and to laze around, I can spend an entire 
                  day without moving of the sofa. That one, look at him, he can't 
                  stay sitting in the same place during more than ten secondes. 
                  Look at him, now! He's always doing something,he sits down,he 
                  stands up,he reads a leaflet,after he goes walking,he phones 
                  to somebody,he fiddles with his rackets. Yevgueni is hyperactive.Me 
                  I am quite passive,I like to see life flowing&quot;. <br>
                  <br>
                  And that's true,in the players lounge guarded as Fort Knox, 
                  YK is agitated and he is always phoning. <br>
                  He is about to play his first match. &quot;I am one of the four 
                  owners of the tournament.To keep it in life today in Russia 
                  is a real bet. People in Moscow need a such event,they are expecting 
                  a lot of things from me.I am very busy,I have a lot of work 
                  with the sponsors, the organization.Year after year, I help 
                  this tournament by finding enough money for it,in order to keep 
                  people dreaming.But, I also have to play and to win...&quot; 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Marat is not worried about YK: &quot;He is one of the best players 
                  ever,the best that Russia has ever had. He is a great singles 
                  player and a great doubles player. He has a big talent and has 
                  a lot of experience. When he realy wants something,it's very 
                  complicated to stop him&quot;. <br>
                  <br>
                  Today YK's opponent gave him some troubles until this ace from 
                  Kafelnikov that the Umpire judged fault. YK, without protesting, 
                  did as if his ace was in and he appropriated the point to himself. 
                  The chair umpire was dumbfounded and he didn't protest against 
                  YK. Neither the opponent. <br>
                  YK plays at home and as he said &quot;it's important for the 
                  tourney that Marat and me win some matches&quot;. <br>
                  <br>
                  Marat Safin knows perfectly well the stake. And it's a strain 
                  on him :&quot; I try to have a normal life, but during the tournament 
                  it's impossible. Everybody wants something, a photo, an autograph. 
                  Me, my job is to play tennis. I don't care about popularity. 
                  I don't want to be invited to all TV shows, I don't want to 
                  see my mug in the front page of all the Russian's newspapers. 
                  I just want to live my life, to do my job and when my day at 
                  the office is finished I want to be a normal guy. Here, it's 
                  impossible. And Yevgueni who bores me in order that I make at 
                  least a semi final, in order that there is a lot of public/audience. 
                  I know what he wants: a head to head between him and me...&quot;. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  YK swore that if he won the DC he would retire. <br>
                  Marat Safin well heard YK's promise.And he will not miss the 
                  opportunity to offer him &quot;a last pleasure,like a goodbye 
                  present&quot;... <br>
