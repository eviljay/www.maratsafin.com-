                    Interview: Kuerten and Safin on Sunday during Tennis Master 
                    Series 2000 in Hamburg </b></font></p>

                    After the singles final, Gustavo Kuerten and Marat Safin did 
                    the press conference together. Here is what Hamburg champion 
                    Kuerten and finalist Safin had to say after the match.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q: </b>Marat, how tired were you at the end? How frustrating 
                    was it to lose so closely, only two points away?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Safin:</b> Well, I wasn't so tired, he was more tired because 
                    he played two finals in a row. But I was too nervous, because 
                    it was the second final of a Super-9 Masters Series, I was 
                    under pressure, because I wanted to win this event. It also 
                    took time and then you start to think at the wrong moment. 
                    I had my chance 0:30 at 6:5, I had my chance during the tie-break 
                    and that's it. That's it, because I didn't play my great tennis 
                    today. I tried to do my best and I tried to push myself to 
                    fight. Actually, he was better than me, for sure. He played 
                    an unbelievable game. If I had won it would be wrong, I think, 
                    because he's much better at the moment and it was normal that 
                    he won.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> Gustavo, do you think you have time to recover for 
                    Paris?<br>
                    <br>
                    Kuerten: Yes, I think I'm right that I'm not playing next 
                    week, so I can rest and work on my body, so I'll be fit again 
                    for the French. It's an important week now. I hope to enjoy 
                    this moment first and then I'll try to think again during 
                    my recovery and then work for next week.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q: </b>Do you expect great things at Roland Garros after 
                    the way you played here this week and before? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Safin:</b> Yes, because I'm surprised with my game and 
                    I didn't expect to play like this after four months without 
                    any victory. Actually there were some changes with my coach 
                    and I'm trying to play different tennis that nobody expects. 
                    But I'm looking forward to Roland Garros, it's an important 
                    tournament and it's a Grand Slam, so I'd like to be in good 
                    form there. It's a great event and it's also a lot of points 
                    in the game. So it would be great to get a good result there. 
                    I hope I'll be ready for Roland Garros, I think I'll be ready 
                    because I'll take a week of practice in Dьsseldorf. I think 
                    it would be great to get some good results in the French Open. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> Do you think within yourself you have the chance 
                    to win it?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Safin:</b> Look at him.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> Is he your favourite?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Safin:</b> No, because there is someone like Norman or 
                    a lot of Spanish guys like Moya and Ferrero, there are a lot 
                    of good players. You can't really say who is going to win, 
                    it's not going to be easy, so you have to work hard and be 
                    prepared for each match. You can do stupid things during the 
                    match, but you have to play from the beginning until the end. 
                    I was fighting but I couldn't win today, but what is different 
                    in the French Open is that there are 128 players and everybody 
                    wants to win. It's much tougher.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> Do you think it's an advantage for Guga having won 
                    it before?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Safin:</b> I don't know, ask him. I don't know. Kuerten: 
                    No, I think not. I think everybody is there to win, like he 
                    said, it's about competition and who is going to be well prepared 
                    and who is going to be in his best day. Last year I was playing 
                    so well, I was feeling the ball so good, and then in the quarters 
                    I played one guy and he was playing better than me, so I had 
                    no chance. I'm just expecting to have a good time there.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> Is Chesnokov going to work with you in Paris?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Safin:</b> I hope so, he's already in Dьsseldorf and he's 
                    a little bit upset with me and I hope he won't be angry tomorrow. 
                    But I will need him for Roland Garros, defenitely, because 
                    I need some support and also Aleksander is going to be there, 
                    I hope so. I will need Andrei, because it will be a difficult 
                    week and I will need some support from his part. Also, he 
                    knows a lot about tennis and it would be great if he would 
                    help me during this week. And afterwards we're going to talk 
                    about our future. But I need him, because he's a great player 
                    and he's a great coach.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> Why is he upset with you?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Safin:</b> No, it was a joke, sorry. No, he's not upset, 
                    he's happy, because I found my game. I know what I have to 
                    do and he needs time to work with me, that's what he said, 
                    just a few weeks to work with the shots and the mental problems. 
                    I think it would be great to have a few weeks to work with 
                    him, he can explain to me everything, what I should do in 
                    each moment.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q: </b>Guga, what did you learn from your defeat in the 
                    French Open last year? Is it a match that is still in your 
                    mind?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Kuerten:</b> No, actually we're used to lose, because if 
                    you play tournaments every week, and if you lose once you 
                    try to forget it. I think it shows the way tennis can be, 
                    one day can be different from the other and you have to be 
                    well prepared and wait for your opportunity. <br>
