                  <b>Q.</b> Could you talk about last week, what you were able 
                  to accomplish last week.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> What do you mean exactly? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Just the whole week. How does that rank now among 
                  your tennis accomplishments, to do what you did last week? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Well, first of all, I was playing very bad 
                  before Toronto because I make second round in Stuttgart and 
                  first round in Kitzbuhel. I play bad, so I went there to try 
                  to get my confidence back. And of course it depends -- the ranking 
                  depends how you play. If you play well, the numbers will come. 
                  The money, the points, everything will come. So I think of course 
                  you want to, when you are No. 9 in the world, you want to be 
                  a little bit more -- a little bit up. So you start to think 
                  about this also. But I think most important is the confidence. 
                  <br>
                  If you have confidence, it's much more easy to get upstairs 
                  and everything. Life is much easier in the court and out of 
                  the court. I think your confidence is very, very important. 
                  Because it's numbers. It's only numbers. It depends how you 
                  feel inside.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>Do you know what was missing in those few weeks?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>No, just very simple thing. I went for holidays 
                  because I played a lot of tournaments. I played two months. 
                  I start in Barcelona, I won this tournament, another one. I 
                  had some good results. I need to rest a little bit. Otherwise 
                  my head, I was going crazy little bit with tennis, with the 
                  balls, with the racquet. The same people each time. I was just 
                  -- I went to holidays. And I lose three kilos. For me, three 
                  kilos is too much. Normally my weight is 85 kilos, so I came 
                  to the Tour back, in Stuttgart I was 88. I couldn't move. For 
                  me, they players I played, I play against, they are playing 
                  very fast. So they are not like the kind of guys that you can 
                  pass the balls and just keeping the ball inside the court and 
                  not run. You get confidence with each set, you get your confidence. 
                  Because you run, you are more concentrated. But when they guys, 
                  they hit each ball 200 kilometers per hour, you don't understand 
                  what is happening because they don't let you play. I mean it's 
                  difficult to get confidence because the confidence you can get 
                  only in the practicing, but most of the time it's on the tournament. 
                  But with a draw -- with the draws, that's what I mean, there's 
                  lots of big names. Also in the ranking of these guys, they are 
                  not very high. But the problem is their style of tennis, everything 
                  is too fast. It's too fast and it's gone. They don't let you 
                  play. You can't get confidence. You start to miss balls. You 
                  get nervous inside. So that's how -- that's why I came to Toronto, 
                  to play tennis. I practiced, I played first two rounds, I mean 
                  it was tough match. I get power, I could make some rallies on 
                  the baseline, so it gives me confidence back. I won those two 
                  matches and after it's becoming much more easier. I get my game 
                  back. I get my confidence and everything was perfect. In the 
                  final, I played good tennis I think. This is just very simple. 
                  You just need to have good draws, try to keep your tennis and 
                  try to keep your confidence always with you. That's it. I know 
                  you don't have to worry about anything more.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Can you tell me, has Kafelnikov helped you on the 
                  Tour?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Everybody, they have different personalities. 
                  What he going to help you, how to play tennis? I mean I know 
                  how I have to play, but of course I learn some things. But is 
                  not from him, it's from everybody. You cannot come to the court 
                  and think, "It's okay, I'm gonna beat this guy," because everybody 
                  is playing. If you play better, better ranking, more guys, they 
                  want to beat you. If I say I don't care, okay. But when you're 
                  five or six, whatever, Top 10, if they beat you, they get motivated. 
                  It's tough. I beat Sampras, I beat Kafelnikov, so each time 
                  you have to play 100 percent so that's the people -- they have 
                  to respect you. Otherwise --.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> That's not from him, that's from everybody?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Everybody.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Are you particularly close with him? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>No, because we have different life. He has 
                  kids, he has family. I'm just a young guy, new. Big kid, yeah, 
                  and I just have some other interests. So it's little difficult 
                  because I am little bit much younger. So the life, when he start, 
                  it was different life than when I start.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> For those of us who just watched, he's one of the 
                  more difficult players to understand on the Tour. I was wondering, 
                  because you're a colleague, if you understand what motivates 
                  him. He plays every week. He runs all over. He never stops.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Okay. Is very simple I think. If you want 
                  to play not like him, I know it's little bit exaggerate, yeah? 
                  Play 35 weeks. But you have to practice anyways, right? You 
                  have to practice. It's better to come to the tournament, you 
                  have a good hotel, you have a swimming pool, you have sauna, 
                  you have a gym, you have a good room, and I mean normally the 
                  tournaments, they are nice places. Also, he's winning money. 
                  I mean if you want, you can stay at home. It's more expensive. 
                  I mean doesn't matter if you have 20 or 2, you don't have any 
                  money. Expenses, you practice, you win money, and it's boring 
                  to practice like this. I think when you spend one or two years 
                  on the Tour you start to think, "What I need to do to stay at 
                  home just for practice? I can be here, I win some matches, I 
                  get money, I get points." Is also good life. Is not so bad to 
                  come for two hours to get what we get. I think it's better than 
                  be at home. Also you have a big crowd with you. They come and 
                  enjoy tennis. You go to practice, you start to sweat, nobody's 
                  watching you. It's a little boring.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Sochi is a beautiful city, though, right?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Yes. I was there. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> He lives in a great place. He doesn't ever get to 
                  go there?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No, he goes sometimes of course. You need 
                  to go home. But not for long time. Because when you go for long 
                  times, you -- I mean it's difficult to come back. You need two 
                  weeks to get your way back, to be in the right physical condition, 
                  technique and all these small things that they help you. Holidays 
                  sometimes are dangerous.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>Is it too much of a leap to say that's the Russian 
                  mindset? Or even because the generation is different, something 
                  -- you came up under Communism. He came up in the Soviet Union, 
                  the idea of you have to go out there every day and keep doing 
                  it. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, I think it's because this question 
                  about the -- I mean it's completely -- he already come not from 
                  Communism. He already become a normal person. If he hurt, he 
                  have nothing to do. In Communism, you can ask Chesnokov. This 
                  is the generation of Communism. They can you explain you many 
                  stories you say, "How is possible?" Everything is possible. 
                  But Yevgeny and other guys, me, we come little bit later. So 
                  they didn't bother us. It was little different.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>Your legendary racquet-breaking, does it distract 
                  you when you get too emotional? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Of course sometimes it's not the best way 
                  to act on the court. But I think, first of all, I was like this 
                  since I was -- since I start to play tennis. Second, because 
                  you need this. You're gonna play tennis, you're not a machine. 
                  My mind, sometimes I get scared. Sometimes I get -- I'm afraid 
                  on the court. I'm afraid with the ball. So I need to do something, 
                  you know, to be little bit more relaxed. Because more you get 
                  afraid, more minutes you're still playing and playing. You can't 
                  play any more tennis. Some moments of the game you get scared, 
                  you get upset because you are missing easy balls. So it lets 
                  you -- you become a little bit more relaxed. I mean the people, 
                  there are a lot of people there in the stands, and I think they 
                  don't shout at me when I am breaking racquet. I didn't destroy 
                  racquet, they start to shouting and everything is bad, I don't 
                  like this crowd. But I just broke my racquet; that's it. It's 
                  not so dangerous. I didn't kill anybody. But also you need this 
                  for -- I think it's -- many guys, they understand. They also 
                  do this. But maybe not so much on the court, but not in a tournament, 
                  but in practice. So many guys, they swing the racquet. It's 
                  only racquet; it's not -- it's just a piece of graphite. That's 
                  it.<br>

                  <b>Q.</b> But you lead the Tour?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I lead the Tour, yeah. This year around 
                  30. I can make some records.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> ...(Inaudible)? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, I was there. When I was 10, I went 
                  to Indianapolis to see this tournament, actually. It was interchange 
                  of the guys Americans to the Russians. I went there and for 
                  me, it was, you know, McEnroe, these guys. It was nice, big 
                  names. But I didn't -- it was little bit different. I have even 
                  -- I have a picture with Boris Becker when he was in '90.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> '90?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, it was '90. If I had to come there, 
                  become like a player. I don't know what I'm going to feel, but 
                  it's little bit...(Inaudible.)<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> (Inaudible)? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah. I was really -- feel really bad when 
                  I won there because I was too far from home without family, 
                  but just living in also with the family. They don't understand 
                  anything in English. But then they start to talk little bit. 
                  So it was -- but it was good for the language, but not for my 
                  tennis because I didn't know how to take the racquet. It was 
                  horrible. But at least I saw some people and make some good 
                  pictures.<br>
