                  05/22/2002<br>
                  By Ossian Shine <br>
                  Reuters.com<br>
                  <br>
                  To watch strapping muscleman Marat Safin play tennis is to recall 
                  poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's most enduring nursery rhyme. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  There is no sign of a little curl on the Russian powerhouse's 
                  forehead but, when he is good he is very, very good and when 
                  he is bad he is horrid. <br>
                  <br>
                  It is these poles of performance which have seen Safin triumph 
                  at the U.S. Open only months after suffering a humiliating first-round 
                  defeat at the Australian grand slam. <br>
                  <br>
                  He has won the Masters event in Canada and just 12 months later 
                  slumped out at the first hurdle as defending champion. <br>
                  <br>
                  One match sublime, the next error-strewn, Safin is as complex 
                  as he is talented. <br>
                  <br>
                  The French Open, however, has been a stage of relative stability 
                  for the Moscow-born, Spanish-raised 22-year-old Safin. <br>
                  <br>
                  Last year's third-round loss -- as second seed -- to bogeyman 
                  Fabrice Santoro was his poorest performance on the slow red 
                  clay of the Roland Garros stadium. <br>
                  <br>
                  A quarter-final appearance in 2000, and two fourth-round showings 
                  before that, illustrate his comfort on the surface. <br>
                  <br>
                  CONFIDENCE HIGH <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin will be seeded second again this year after a runners-up 
                  spot in the Australian Open in January and a runners-up spot 
                  on the Rothenbaum clay at the Hamburg Masters last week. <br>
                  <br>
                  His confidence is high and he is looking forward to an assault 
                  on the French crown. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I haven't won a tournament yet this year,&quot; Safin 
                  said after blasting world number one Lleyton Hewitt in the quarter-finals 
                  in Hamburg. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I made a few quarter-finals (and) semifinals but I want 
                  to win a tournament and then it will be a different story -- 
                  I'm on my way to playing my best tennis.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin's best tennis is an awesome sight. He drove a dagger into 
                  Pete Sampras's career in New York two years ago. <br>
                  <br>
                  The American holder of a record 13 grand slam titles had just 
                  won his seventh Wimbledon. Gunning to stretch the record to 
                  14 slams, nothing could prepare him for the torrid thrashing 
                  he received at the hands of Safin in the U.S. Open final. <br>
                  <br>
                  Having struggled in the early rounds, Safin lost just one set 
                  in his last four matches as he collected his first grand slam 
                  crown -- inflicting Sampras's first straight-sets defeat in 
                  a grand slam final. <br>
                  <br>
                  SHELL-SHOCKED <br>
                  <br>
                  Sampras was shell-shocked afterwards and predicted a long period 
                  of domination for the Russian. <br>
                  <br>
                  That year Safin won a season-high seven ATP titles, briefly 
                  hit the number one spot and became the youngest player to finish 
                  the year ranked world number two since a 19-year-old Boris Becker 
                  in 1986. <br>
                  <br>
                  Only a mammoth effort by Gustavo Kuerten, who won the end-of-season 
                  Masters Cup in Lisbon, prevented Safin from becoming the first 
                  Russian year-end number one. <br>
                  <br>
                  But back problems in the early part of 2001 contributed to patchy 
                  form and he failed to reach a quarter-final of any event until 
                  Wimbledon in June. <br>
                  <br>
                  As defending champion, he reached the semifinals in New York 
                  where Sampras got his revenge but it proved a breakthrough for 
                  the Russian and he went on to capture a 10th career title with 
                  the St. Petersburg crown. <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin knows that on his day he can demolish anyone in the world. 
                  It is the consistency of his peers that he craves. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;This is very important, to keep your concentration,&quot; 
                  he says. &quot;When you have won the first set you have to be 
                  careful in the beginning of the second set. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I was, when I was young, number one,&quot; the 22-year-old 
                  Russian laughed in Hamburg. &quot;I'm trying to get back there. 
                  That is my goal for sure. To be number one for a long time. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  HAPPY AND SATISFIED <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;But all this 'if I stay concentrated,' 'if I keep this 
                  level' -- it is no good. <br>
                  &quot;This if, if, if...if I do this and if I do that. I am 
                  like this. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I have some weak points in my game. It is now important 
                  to be more consistent. I have to win more matches. <br>
                  &quot;If I play consistently, then I have the confidence and 
                  I'm more calm. Then it's like routine. <br>
                  &quot;Basically you just have to improve, to improve. Be more 
                  consistent. That is the main thing. Two years ago I couldn't 
                  volley, I have improved. I improved my forehand and my backhand. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;But I'm feeling very happy and satisfied. I'm first in 
                  the Champions' Race. So I'm well prepared for Roland Garros. 
                  <br>
                  &quot;I'm moving well and serving well. I have to make sure 
                  I'll be able to do the same when I get there.&quot; <br>
                  If he does move the same, play the same and think the same when 
                  he hits the Parisian clay, expect to see Marat Safin pounding 
                  opponents well into the second week. <br>
                  <br>
                  It can only be a matter of time before he adds to his grand 
                  slam haul. <br>
