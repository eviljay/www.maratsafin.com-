                    Q. Well, Marat, what a match. The first two and a half sets 
                    you could do nothing wrong. Did he then pick up his game, 
                    or did you let it slip a little bit, or what?<br>
<br>
A. No, I just, I made a few mistakes in 4-2. I missed, I 
                    missed a very important shot on my backhand because I think 
                    I went for too much. I didn't want to hit at Pete because 
                    he was on the net, and I miss it. And definitely, it's not 
                    the best way to play this point, you know, just to putting 
                    the ball down the line. I think you should go for a little 
                    bit more. And just this point changed all my match, and could 
                    be very dangerous because Pete, he start to play well. He 
                    just, he made unbelievable comeback, he started so well, and 
                    he was playing good. And now, I'm happy that I'm satisfied 
                    also with my game. Even tiebreaker in the fourth set I was 
                    down 4-2 and I could finish the match, and I finish the match 
                    with a forehand which is very important for me.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, when you missed that forehand on the first match 
                    point, what was going through your head?<br>
<br>
A. So many things because, first of all, I think you have 
                    Pete Sampras at the net and he's so big, so huge, and you 
                    just have to make the passing shot, and you have to make it 
                    so perfect so that he doesn't get this ball, otherwise you 
                    are in trouble. So I was scared, actually, and just, I tried 
                    to put the ball, and you cannot. You just, you have to go 
                    a little bit for, you have to go for - go for it - just play 
                    it, and whatever happens, because against Pete you can't play 
                    putting the ball. And that's what I did, basically, in the 
                    last match point. I just went for it. It was perfect.<br>
<br>
Q. Is that the best you have played since the US Open, today?<br>
<br>
A. I think it was a great match. I was, I was tough today. 
                    Even, you know, I was a little bit down after the third set. 
                    But I stayed there. I fought, and I played, I played great 
                    first two, two and a half sets; and even in the fourth set 
                    I was there. I played well, and the tiebreak was quite good, 
                    a few good returns, and of course it gives you a lot of confidence 
                    after this match.<br>
<br>
Q. It was a fabulous shot on the final match point?<br>
<br>
A. Yeah, it was good. I didn't even expect that I can put 
                  
                    the forehand this way, you know, down the line, and having 
                    Pete, you know, coming for the net. And I made it. So I was, 
                    I was so happy that just, so many, so many things into my 
                    head, you know<br>
                    - &quot;I'm winning, I'm finish, it's already 12.30 at night&quot; 
                    - because if you go to the fifth set, you never know how it 
                    can finish,. And, of course, it's - it would not be very nice 
                    to go five sets with Pete, because you never know. Pete has 
                    such a big experience, and you can lose. If you lose this 
                    match it's just, can turn your tennis all the way round, from 
                    the great match to finish the match horrible and without confidence.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, you had a lot of interaction with the umpire tonight. 
                    Were you sort of distracted or annoyed that he talked to you 
                    so much?<br>
<br>
A. No, I think it's just - I mean, everybody has to understand 
                    that. Not only me complaining with the chair umpires. Pete, 
                    he had, you know, his points, that he thought the ball was 
                    out and the ball was in. So I think it's normal. It's a part 
                    of the game. And the chair umpire is also participating in 
                    the game. He doesn't have to say, you know, &quot;5-4 for 
                    Sampras&quot; and all these things. He has to also be in the 
                    match. And, of course, you have some points you have to discuss 
                    with him. I think it's normal. I hope nobody is taking it 
                    very personal. It's the match, and after the match is a different 
                    story. But you just have to understand also the other players 
                    who are fighting with the chair umpires, with everybody, because 
                    they want, I want to win. You know why I want to win? Because 
                    15,000 reasons inside of the tennis court, and you have to 
                    give all your best, I think. That's my point. If somebody 
                    just doesn't understand me, it's their problem. I'm trying 
                    all my best on the court, all the time I'm going inside, and 
                    I'm doing this for the spectators, not for nobody else.<br>
<br>
Q. At one stage you changed racquet and Pete seemed to question 
                    whether you had sort of, what you were doing. Was there any 
                    sort of needle between the players tonight at all?<br>
<br>
A. No, I'm great with Pete. On court, I think it's different 
                    story. He wants to beat me, I wants to beat him. But just 
                    nothing. I change the racquets, and only reason I change racquets 
                    is because of the strings. I don't know what was the point, 
                    because of the strings. And, of course, he is complaining; 
                    but he has to understand also. He is change racquets and nobody 
                    complains, so why he should complain when I'm changing the 
                    racquets. It's okay. There was no problems with him. I never 
                    had a problem and it was great him.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, how do you get - how do you sit with this Rebound 
                    Ace compared to the court in the US Open. What is the difference 
                    technically? Where do you feel better?<br>
<br>
A. Just, it's not such a big difference; but different, different 
                    surface. It's - here is, like, I don't know. It's a different 
                    material. They bounce more here. The ball bounce more, and 
                    - yeah, it's slower, it's a little bit slower than US Open.<br>
<br>
Q. It's better or worse for you?<br>
<br>
A. It's just different. It's just different. I'm doing well 
                    here and I did, I always did well in US Open. So it's just 
                    a matter of practice and get used to the surface.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, are you better in your mind than you were last 
                    year, and, if so, why?<br>
<br>
A. Because everything is organised, you know. Everything 
                    was prepared, you know. I prepare myself for this year. I 
                    had great preparation. I'm travelling with the people that 
                    I want, I'm travelling with my friends, and I'm having fun. 
                    It's just, I think it's - I want to have fun and I want to 
                    enjoy my tennis, and the only reason I can enjoy my tennis 
                    is being with my friends around, and they are helping me and 
                    they are giving me the confidence that I need.<br>
<br>
Q. Last year was not the case?<br>
<br>
A. No. Last year was a little bit different because I got 
                    injured. I had problems and I couldn't find my game. I got 
                    nervous, and I was just - I was a little bit lost. So I need 
                    to stop and I stop for two months, and I just prepared everything 
                    for this year. So I'll be dangerous for this year, for sure.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, what about friends? I've never seen so many blondies 
                    and groupies in a player box?<br>
<br>
A. Definitely.<br>
<br>
Q. Are all they friends of yours or - - -<br>
<br>
A. They are friends of my friends. Definitely, I think you 
                    have to admit that I have unbelievably beautiful bench.<br>
<br>
Q. Very good taste.<br>
<br>
A. Thank you.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, he's only jealous.<br>
<br>
A. It's okay. You can be part of the party.<br>
<br>
Q. Okay. Thanks.<br>
<br>
Q. Are you living now in Switzerland?<br>
<br>
A. Yes. <br>
<br>
Q. Too much pressure in Valencia?<br>
<br>
A. No, just - I had nothing else in Valencia. It was a great 
                    experience. I spent there seven years, and I don't have anything 
                    else there.<br>
<br>
Q. Not even the girlfriend?<br>
<br>
A. No, not any more, not any more. I just moved there. I 
                    tried to find something else. I moved to the Geneva and I 
                    want to be a little bit more closer to Russia.<br>
<br>
Q. Have you been in contact on the phone with Mats this week?<br>
<br>
A. No. I have to call him because there's so much - I'm a 
                    little lost with the time. I can't even call to my friends 
                    in Moscow, because too early, always too late.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, why did you say it was very important for you to 
                    finish the match on your forehand?<br>
<br>
A. Because it gives you confidence and it's, I think it's 
                    - as everybody can see that my backhand is my, is better than 
                    my forehand. But also, I get confidence in my forehand, I 
                    can be very dangerous. So it's very important for me to finish 
                    the match with a great passing shot from the forehand, which 
                    will give me so much confidence in the next round that I will 
                    need it.<br>
<br>
Q. The matter of the running forehand, you hit a bunch of 
                    them today?<br>
<br>
A. Yeah, I'm trying to improve, you know, even on the match. 
                    I'm doing well. I'm happy that everything is working.<br>
<br>
Q. And what about the next round?<br>
<br>
A. What about the next round: great player, very experienced, 
                    and very talented. He made a great come back against Ljubicic. 
                    He was losing two sets to Love. He was two sets to Love down 
                    and 5-1, and he came back. He won today against Costa, and 
                    he has a lot of confidence. But also, he played two matches 
                    five sets. So I hope Wayne is not so fresh like he can be. 
                    But definitely, it is going to be very tough, very tough.<br>
<br>
Q. Were you tired tonight, around the end? Were you ready 
                    to play fifth set?<br>
<br>
A. Just, for me, it wasn't - because you never know, it's 
                    just, you can see the time is, it's too late, and five sets 
                    against Pete, and you have to be concentrated against him. 
                    You cannot just - and I didn't want to play fifth set. You 
                    never want to play fifth set against Pete, because you never 
                    know what can happen. He can make such a great return that 
                    just, your game is gone, and then he holds his serve and that's 
                    it, you are in big trouble. And, of course, I was two sets 
                    to Love up, and a break in the third, so then go to find the 
                    motivation for the fifth set against Pete.<br>
<br>
Q. Do you think he was trying to influence the linesmen at 
                    some stage?<br>
<br>
A. I don't know. The match is finished. I don't really want 
                    to discuss about the linesmen. I had my points and I said 
                    to the chair umpire and, yeah, I have, I have too many thoughts 
                    about these things. It's okay. I just, I won the match so 
                    I can't complain.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, I know that you asked Brojin to stay next to you 
                    for these days. What do you want from him? Is it friend just, 
                    or a coach, or a future coach, or what? What kind of relationship?<br>
<br>
A. No, he's friend. I've known him for a long time. He is 
                    a great friend of mine.<br>
<br>
Q. Is he helping also technically?<br>
<br>
A. Not just that - he is giving, of course he is giving his 
                    opinion. It's great, you know, to have the people that, they 
                    care about you. And just it's - I'm happy to be next to him, 
                    you know. He is staying in my hotel room and we are having 
                    fun. It's great. I'm pretty satisfied that he is bringing 
                    me luck.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, how many friends do you actually have here, and 
                    where are they all from?<br>
<br>
Q. The Entourage.<br>
<br>
Q. Blondies?<br>
<br>
A. It's my team. It's my team and just, enough, enough friends, 
                    you know, to support me. I need some support. I need to find 
                    the motivation, you know, against Sampras. That's why I brought 
                    so many blondes. That's why I have Brojin and all my friends.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, how do you fancy your chances of going all the 
                    way here?<br>
<br>
A. They are growing. They are growing from day to day. I 
                    think I have a big chance to, at least to play well against 
                    Wayne. But I don't know how it can finish, but I'm pretty 
                    confident, and I'm looking forward to playing against Wayne. 
                    And then I will see. Quarter-finals, you really have to take 
                    it serious. <br>
<br>
Q. With what you saw of Pete tonight, how much longer do 
                    you see that he will continue at the top level?<br>
<br>
A. I didn't even think about these things, you know. I just, 
                    I want to finish the match as soon as possible, and I didn't 
                    want to - I saw him for three hours and it's enough for me, 
                    you know. It's okay. We can stay friends, but three hours, 
                    I think, with Pete, is too much. Believe me, it's way too 
                    much. He's too dangerous, too big.<br>
<br>
Q. If one day you have to celebrate, will you celebrate first 
                    with Brojin or with the blondies?<br>
<br>
A. I'll answer you if I win here, okay,<br>
                  <br>
