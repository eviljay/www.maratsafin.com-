                  M. SAFIN - D. Nalbandian 6-3, 6-2<br>
                  An interview with: MARAT SAFIN</b><br>
              <br>
<br>
THE MODERATOR: Before we start with the questions, you obviously 
                    know Marat has become the third player to qualify for Tennis 
                    Masters Cup Shanghai, after Lleyton Hewitt and Andre Agassi.<br>
<br>
Q. So, Marat, how do you feel about this qualification, 
                    relief? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I've been nervous for the last couple of weeks 
                    because, you know, the points, everybody was so close. So 
                    everybody could qualify.<br>
So now it's easy, I will enjoy this week. Just I have no 
                    more pressure. I can play my tennis and I have nothing to 
                    lose and just enjoy the time. <br>
<br>
 Q. Is it good to have this off your back and be done with 
                    it? <br>
<br>
 MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. I'm really, really happy, because I start 
                    to have my doubts about this, about qualifying. I thought 
                    that I will not be there. But just it was such, yeah, it was 
                    long time.<br>
 So now I have everything just arranged, I am there. Like 
                    I said, just I have no more pressure.<br>
<br>
 Q. Has it been difficult for you to focus on tennis after 
                    what happened in Moscow? <br>
<br>
 MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but it happened in Moscow. I wasn't in 
                    Moscow at the time. Also, I'm not a politician so I have nothing 
                    to say and I have nothing to ?? I have no comments, you know. 
                  <br>
Just people are taking care of it. I am here. I have my 
                    own problems, you know, to take care of the problems of others. 
                    It's so sad, but, you know, it happens. <br>
<br>
 Q. Your game is different when you aren't stressed and you 
                    are stressed?<br>
<br>
 MARAT SAFIN: I'm not under stress.<br>
<br>
 Q. I mean now you have no stress with the result and with 
                    Shanghai. How will your game be different? <br>
<br>
 MARAT SAFIN: No, I just, you know, it can't be a lot different. 
                    Just will be, you know, easier for me just, you know, I have 
                    nothing to lose. That's why.<br>
Nobody will blame me because I lost. Nobody will, you know 
                    ?? just they give me suggestions how to live and how to play 
                    tennis. Now everything is arranged. I'm in the Masters. I'm 
                    No. 3 in the world. I'm also not defending anything here. 
                    I can improve my ranking. Also I'm not defending anything 
                    in Masters, which I didn't play. <br>
 So for me, it's just a time to enjoy and to prepare myself 
                    for Shanghai and to do well here of course. The way I play 
                    today, I think I'm in the right way. <br>
<br>
 Q. It makes your preparation for Davis Cup a lot more difficult? 
                  <br>
<br>
 MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, well, we have a lot of times, a lot of 
                    ?? we have weeks, still. It's in four weeks, Davis Cup.<br>
So we have this week, we have the week to prepare ourselves 
                    for Shanghai, then two weeks, almost two weeks to prepare 
                    ourselves for Davis Cup. That's more than a month.<br>
 We want to finish the year as quickly as we can because 
                    it's been a really long year for me. And I'm getting a little 
                    bit ?? I'm a little bit tired of tennis and I'm a little bit 
                    tired of all the time being on the tour and going from tournament 
                    to tournament.<br>
 Of course, it's my job. But also it's at the end of the 
                    season and I want to have my vacation just like every other 
                    normal person. <br>
 I just, you know, just four weeks more and we will be ready 
                    for Davis Cup definitely. <br>
<br>
 Q. Kafelnikov said he felt really proud of what you did 
                    in Davis Cup this year. Does it mean as much for you as it 
                    means for him? <br>
<br>
 MARAT SAFIN: Of course. It means for everybody. We made 
                    only two finals in our history of tennis. Also we didn't have 
                    really great players, but now we both Top 10, both players 
                    who won Grand Slams. So it means that, you know, just such 
                    a big opportunity. <br>
 But anyway we are playing out of Russia, but still, you 
                    know, we have a chance because Yevgeny knows how to play these 
                    kind of matches under pressure. I have a couple of experience. 
                    I think I can handle it. It's a big opportunity, even though 
                    we're playing outside. It's a big opportunity, and I think 
                    we have a chance to win this tie here in Paris. <br>
 It will be great, a great present for myself and for Yevgeny. 
                    If he wants to retire, then he can retire. Just will be great 
                    ending of the year.<br>
<br>
Q. Is playing on clay also in your advantage, does it equalize 
                    your chances? <br>
<br>
 MARAT SAFIN: I don't know actually why they choose the clay. 
                    I think they put the clay against us. But also it doesn't 
                    suit them. They don't have really clay court players. Grosjean, 
                    he can play actually on every surface. Escude, he can play 
                    on clay because his tennis is for that surface. He's dangerous 
                    on grass, and indoor fast.<br>
 Clement, yeah, he can play. But still, you know, we have 
                    the same ?? we have no problems to play on clay actually. 
                 <br>
So I think we can...<br>
<br>
Q. I saw Andrei Chesnokov around here. Is he coaching you?<br>
<br>
 MARAT SAFIN: No, he's not coaching me. (Inaudible). <br>
<br>
 Q. Do you know where you will prepare the final after Shanghai?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, I spoke to Yevgeny, I spoke to our captain 
                    and everybody. They decide to go to Monte?Carlo.<br>
<br>
Q. Is it true? <br>
<br>
 MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. I don't think they lie to me (smiling). 
             <br>
<br>
 Q. You had problems in the past with injuries. This year, 
                    Guga had a difficult year. You climbed the mountain and now 
                    you are in Shanghai and maybe finishing the year at what you 
                    deserve. What can you say about this time, that you pass through? 
                 <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I think, now, we have everybody is injury, 
                    late November. We are playing every week. The tennis, the 
                    level is growing. So each match you suffer, you give 100 percent. 
                    It's not like before, you have the first rounds you can win 
                    easy then you play a tough match and it's... You know.<br>
 Now it's every match you play, every match you have to give 
                    everything. Your muscles, they get tired and at the end, they 
                    break. It's like when I have the three injuries in three years 
                    ? the elbow, what I have, the back, and the back again.<br>
So it's like ?? it's a problem. And you can see everybody 
                    has wrist problems or ankle or back or shoulder. You know, 
                    how many people this year had to make the operation? Johansson 
                    had to make the operation. Kafelnikov he has problems with 
                    the ankle. I don't know what he has to make, but he's suffering.<br>
 Just you have to do something, but you cannot fight it. 
                    It's just you have to work physically. But also, you know, 
                    you are getting tired of doing all the time fitness, fitness, 
                    fitness. And in the end you start to hate your tennis. You 
                    spend more time on the fitness and in the gym than on the 
                    court.<br>
But of course, if you don't want to get injured, you have 
                    to work. You need to spend hours and hours in the gym and 
                    make massages, recuperation, all these things. You are not 
                    sure that you will be, you know, you will be not injured.<br>
 So it happens. It happens. Just you cannot fight against 
                    this. <br>
<br>
 Q. Do you know the dates you are returning to Monte?Carlo? 
                <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Dates? They didn't tell me yet. They said Monte?Carlo, 
                    so...<br>
 After Shanghai, I think. Straight after Shanghai we're flying 
                    there. <br>
<br>
Q. Now you play Schalken in the next round. Have you been 
                    surprised about his results this year, especially in the Slams? 
               <br>
<br>
 MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, I think he played well. What he made 
                    in Wimbledon ? I don't remember ? semifinals, quarterfinals? 
                <br>
<br>
Q. Quarter finals. <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: He made semifinals in US Open. He's playing 
                    well. He's Top 20? <br>
<br>
Q. 19. <br>
<br>
 MARAT SAFIN: He's a dangerous player. So I mean last time 
                    I play against him was in Boston three years ago; so long 
                    time ago that I play against him. It will be nice to play. 
                    We'll see what's gonna happen. I don't know. 
                    <br>
