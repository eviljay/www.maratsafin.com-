<P class=style7 align=center><STRONG>WE PUT TEN QUESTIONS TO MARAT ON VARIOUS TOPICS DURING <BR>HIS STAY IN PARIS&nbsp;FOR THE PARIS MASTERS AT BERCY AND <BR>THESE WERE HIS ANSWERS.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P align=center><STRONG><IMG src="/Admin/spaw/DatabaseImages/Maratmike.jpg"><BR></STRONG><EM>Picture thanks to tennisalbum.fr</EM></P>
<P class=style6><BR><STRONG>1) Who is the person or persons who you feel has had the most influence on your career?</STRONG></P>
<P class=style6><EM><STRONG><FONT color=#ffd781>Answer: My Mother and my Spanish coach "Rafa"</FONT></STRONG></EM></P>
<P class=style6><STRONG>2) If you had not been a professional tennis player, what other career would you have liked to have chosen?</STRONG></P>
<P class=style6><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#ffd781>Answer: Probably my physical abilities would push me to be in other sport - and my personality would mean I would be something self employed.</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P class=style6><STRONG>3) Is there any particular reason that keeps you motivated in your tennis career.</STRONG></P>
<P class=style6><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#ffd781>Answer: I hate losing!!!!</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P class=style6><STRONG>4) Do you have any particular goals or ambitions you would like to achieve in the future?</STRONG></P>
<P class=style6><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#ffd781>Answer: I would like to win another Grand Slam and definitely to be competitive in the Top 5 again.</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P class=style6><STRONG>5) Are your fans important to you and how do you think they have helped you?</STRONG></P>
<P class=style6><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#ffd781>Answer: The support that I got especially in the difficult times of my injuries - has been a vital force in my ability to recover. The important part is to have the support of my fans through the hard times and that support gave me a lot of power to keep going.</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P class=style6><STRONG>6) What would you say is the best advice you have ever been given?</STRONG></P>
<P class=style6><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#ffd781>Answer: To accept who I am, believe in myself and to appreciate the talent given to me.</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P class=style6><STRONG>7) Is there any particular person or event that has left a special impression on you?</STRONG></P>
<P class=style6><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#ffd781>Answer: My preformance in 1998 beating both&nbsp;Agassi and Keurten at Roland Garros made me believe that I can make it as a player. It also made a special connection between me and the Paris tournaments at Roland Garros and Bercy.</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P class=style6><STRONG>8) You do lots of interviews/talks in your job. What is the most annoying thing that is always asked?</STRONG></P>
<P class=style6><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#ffd781>Answer: I don't like when they try to penetrate my private life or to criticize me expressing my emotions on court. It seems like I have learnt to accept myself but sometimes the journalists are insisting on always picking on this same issue.</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P class=style6><STRONG>9) You have always stated you don't like the word celebrity but being world famous as you are, do you find your friends are the people who have helped you keep your feet on the ground and how?</STRONG></P>
<P class=style6><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#ffd781>Answer: I have no celebrity friends and I don't consider myself as a celebrity. I just feel as someone who is very good at his job (smiles - Not always!!) and I am just like any other person - same emotions and feelings and my friends are the ones who accept me as who I am as a person - not according to my ranking!</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P class=style6><STRONG>10 a) Tennis is your job. Since you turned professional - do you think tennis has developed in a positive way?</STRONG></P>
<P class=style6><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#ffd781>Answer: Just like any other thing it has its ups and downs. It had its turbulence with the retirement of legends like Becker, Sampras and Agassi but I think that recently there are other guys who can follow in their footsteps and become as big as these guys.</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P class=style6><STRONG>10 b) What else do you feel could be done to improve the Mens' Tour from a player's point of view?</STRONG></P>
<P class=style6><STRONG><EM><FONT color=#ffd781>Answer: Like I have said many times, the season should be shorter and more exclusive. This will help to increase the competition, the excitement and the interest in the game.<BR>If the season would be shorter and more competitive, it would mean there would always be the taste and expectation of more to come. <BR>Like in December we play the Davis Cup Final and then 2 months later in February the winners are defending their title. How many people will remember who won before when they lose first round? There is no expectation of more to happen.</FONT></EM></STRONG></P>
<P class=style6><STRONG><EM></EM></STRONG>&nbsp;</P>
<P class=style6><STRONG><EM>Thank you.</EM></STRONG></P>
