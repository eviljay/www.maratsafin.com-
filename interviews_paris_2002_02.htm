                  An interview with: MARAT SAFIN</b><br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  THE MODERATOR: First question for Marat, please. <br>
<br>
Q. I guess you must be pretty happy with your game this 
                    week. Can you remember when you played so consistently? <br>
<br>
 MARAT SAFIN: Long time ago. A long time ago (smiling).<br>
 I think maybe Roland Garros I played so well. Since then, 
                    I didn't really get any good results, you know, and I couldn't 
                    ?? I didn't play really well for last couple of months. Now 
                    I am starting to get my confidence back. <br>
 It's good to be in a semifinals here. It's a big tournament. 
                    Just to prepare myself also for Shanghai, to get some confidence. 
            <br>
<br>
 Q. How can you explain how it came back? Do you think the 
                    fact that you're qualified for the Masters changed everything 
                    in your mind?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, it's little bit. So I have no more pressure, 
                    you know, to get anywhere. Just I can play my tennis, I can 
                    enjoy being on the court and play some great matches. It's 
                    easy. It's much easier for me.<br>
 It's just easier for everybody to play without pressure. 
                 <br>
<br>
 Q. How frustrating would it be to end the year without any 
                    title? <br>
<br>
 MARAT SAFIN: It's okay. Life is not ending, you know? That's 
                    one year without winning any tournaments, is not really bad. 
                    I'm still No. 3 in the world, so is not so bad.<br>
 Wait just a second, my mother calling (cell phone ringing.)<br>
<br>
 Q. Next step against Moya. <br>
<br>
 MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, tough opponent. He played really well 
                    today. He was serving well. He was playing ?? moving Agassi 
                    all over the court. He's playing really, really well. <br>
 He won four titles this year, beat me in Monte?Carlo 7?6 
                    in the third. It will be great to have an opportunity to take 
                    the revenge. Just a faster surface, I think I have more chances 
                    to beat him. <br>
<br>
Q. What did you think of the game of Escude today? <br>
<br>
 MARAT SAFIN: He played well except first game of first set. 
                    Then he start to get confident in the second set. He make 
                    me break straightaway. He was serving well. He was making 
                    good volleys, great baseline. He was returning well, really 
                    well today on my second serve. <br>
So I was always under pressure, and I had to make some first 
                    serves if I wanted to help my serve.<br>
<br>
 Q. Do you think he will be a strong opponent even on clay 
                    for the Davis Cup final?<br>
<br>
 MARAT SAFIN: I don't think clay is his best surface actually, 
                    because he is making serve and volley all the time. And on 
                    clay it's a bit difficult because it's much slower and he 
                    has to stay on the baseline. I don't think he gonna play.<br>
<br>
 Q. He was very impressed by the fact that you almost did 
                    not miss any lob. Do you think it was one of the key of the 
                    match?<br>
<br>
 MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. Yes, I think so, because he has great 
                    volleys. But he's getting a little bit too close to the net. 
                    So that's why I think lob is the best shot I could make today, 
                    best passing shot. Because otherwise, if you play down the 
                    line or cross?court, he can get it because he's a tall guy 
                    and he has long arms. So the best way is to make lobs. <br>
