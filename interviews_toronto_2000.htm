                        event. He reached the Hamburg semifinals and then went 
                        on to the finals in Hamburg last year and also in -- this 
                        year. And in Paris Indoor, '99, went on to the finals 
                        there as well. First question for Marat? _</font><br>

                  <b>REPORTER: </b>Marat, you hit a fabulous backhand cross-court 
                  passing shot at 8-7, the last match point he had. You must have 
                  been very pleased with that, when you took your time and there 
                  was a lot of pressure on you, you hit it very well.<br>
                  <b><br>
                  M. SAFIN:</b> But also I had a chance to make it on a -- on 
                  my match point at 6-5. It was like 15-40, and I had like normal 
                  passing shot, but too many things I had in my head, I had Pete 
                  Sampras, I had central court, I had match points, I had too 
                  many things in my head to make it. So I missed it. But eventually 
                  I make a few good ones which they helped me a lot. But I'm satisfied 
                  with this. If I would make this passing shot in the match point, 
                  I think it would be unbelievable to finish this match like this.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER:</b> It wouldn't be so exciting if you won at 6-5 
                  in the third set, the tie-breaker was good.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> Tie-break? For you maybe it was good, but for 
                  me I lost ten years of my life. But also I had just -- I just 
                  told myself that I can do it, that I have enough head, enough 
                  balls to beat him, which is very important to me. That not so 
                  easy to beat, I can play also a tie-breaker against Pete which 
                  is always, who, you know, in a tie-breaker make a few good serve, 
                  a few good returns, that's it, the tie-breaker gone. So you're 
                  always under pressure. Just, I was lucky, I was patient and 
                  I made it.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER:</b> Is this the best win of your career? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN: </b>Yes, I think so, because he was number one 
                  in the world. He's the best player of -- ever we have. There 
                  wasn't another player better than him. I think it's very important 
                  for me. Also to beat him in a tough match. Because if you beat 
                  him 6-2, 6-2, everybody knows that he didn't play his best tennis. 
                  But if you play him 7-6 in the third, of course everybody knows 
                  that he wants to win. So I'm satisfied also with this, it wasn't 
                  6-2, 6-2, so easy.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER:</b> Why did it take you so long to come to the 
                  press conference?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> I have to take care of myself, also. Sorry. 
                  I have to make some massage, smell good, shower.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER:</b> Yesterday when I talked to you, you said that 
                  the last time that you played Sampras, that you were afraid 
                  to beat him. What changed for this match?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> No, just because Alexander Volkov told me he 
                  beat him twice, so I said, "Why can't I beat him?" I mean, if 
                  he beat him twice, there's nothing -- I don't have to be afraid. 
                  Also, I'm not losing too much. I just have to play, I have to 
                  be a hundred per cent sure what I want in the match. You cannot 
                  think match when you make a return or make a passing shot, you 
                  just have to be sure. Okay, pass it down the line, you pass 
                  it down the line. You don't have to think too much about it. 
                  Which was a mistake on the match point, when I missed my cross-court 
                  passing shot. You don't have to do this against him. You just 
                  have to be concentrated and sure in your mind what you have 
                  to do.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>TOUR OFFICIAL:</b> Just to clarify, Alexander Volkov that 
                  Marat just mentioned, was a former tour player. He's the tournament 
                  director of the Kremlin Cup, in Moscow, and is travelling with 
                  Marat this week and has travelled with him a few weeks. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> Just like friends. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>TOUR OFFICIAL:</b> And his friend. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER: </b>You've switched several coaches. Can you explain 
                  why you've done that and how it's helped you?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> No, I think I didn't change them so often, 
                  just I quit with my old one that I had for six years. It just 
                  was too many years. We didn't respect each other like coach 
                  and player, he was more like my father. It was a little bit 
                  different. It was a little bit tough. Same like you travel with 
                  your father, the same feeling. You start once where you start 
                  to be nervous, everything is not good atmosphere to be in the 
                  top, just like a family, small family. So I put Andre -- we 
                  had a small misunderstanding, a very simple one, nothing wrong 
                  with -- nothing from other world, just one small misunderstanding. 
                  Also, he couldn't travel a lot with me because he has two kids, 
                  wife, many things to do and also Tony Picard, it was only in 
                  the grass court tournaments. After this, I don't have anybody. 
                  So it was just two simple things. Andre, he couldn't work with 
                  me because he had other things to do. And Tony Picard can't 
                  travel because he was a lot of years on the tour. He could not 
                  do it. So now I'm free. Nobody loves me. Nobody wants to work 
                  with me. And I'm just travelling with my friend, because he's 
                  making big favour. I'm really appreciate this that he's doing 
                  for me these things at U.S. Open, but he also has a job, a business 
                  in Russia, he's a tournament director, so I cannot ask for more. 
                  So I will find a solution after U.S. Open. We'll see.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER:</b> Marat, I know in the past, you've broken a 
                  few racquets over the course of a tournament. And I'm wondering, 
                  Pete mentioned the fact that you were mentally strong today 
                  during the match. And I wondered if it was hard for you to contain 
                  your emotions?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> No, actually I broke too many this year. I 
                  broke too many last year. And today also I have the same feeling 
                  when he had a match point, it was like 8-7, when he served he 
                  made double fault. Before match point I was thinking about how 
                  to break the racquet. Suddenly he make the double fault. So 
                  I was lucky there. So, I mean, it's not a question to break 
                  so many racquets, but sometimes you need this and I think the 
                  people, they understand this because we are human beings and 
                  we need to try to break it because it's only a racquet, it's 
                  nothing else. But I know it's not very nice on the court. It 
                  doesn't look very, I would say, very educated. But, sorry, we 
                  are players. A lot of things happens in the court, in your head, 
                  all these difficult matches, 7-6 in the third. So it's many 
                  things. So sometimes you just break it and you don't think about 
                  what will happen after. You are just thinking about the racquet, 
                  then you need it. You can't live without it. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER:</b> Marat, I hope this doesn't sound like a silly 
                  question, but if you were a tennis fan, coming tomorrow to watch 
                  the semifinals, would you be excited about the matchups?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> What do you want me to answer? You don't have 
                  to ask me, you have to ask the people. If you want to take the 
                  microphone, you can go to the crowd and ask them, "Are you going 
                  to come tomorrow, or no?" How can I answer this question? I 
                  think it's not a silly question, because I don't know the answer. 
                  I don't know. There's no Agassi, there's no Sampras. There's 
                  no Kafelnikov. There's no -- I don't know, Rafter in the semifinal. 
                  It's a little bit -- Novak, Levy, and Safin and Ferreira. You 
                  know the answer. I don't think so.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER:</b> You had quite a few fans calling out your name 
                  during the match and you seemed to have quite a large gallery 
                  of supporters out there, and I wonder if you could comment on 
                  whether that surprised you and how you felt about it?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> I think I can't believe that there is more 
                  Russians than Americans here. It's unbelievable. It's everywhere, 
                  even in locker rooms, there's Russians. I mean, I never saw 
                  so many Russians in a tournament. And everybody wants to help 
                  you and everybody knows about tennis, a lot. I mean it's nice, 
                  but sometimes you know, "You want to play for me, or what?" 
                  You know, they come to you with, "Come on, Marat, this point, 
                  you have to hit the forehand down the line, you have to serve 
                  cross-court." I mean, you get surprised because the people they 
                  understand so much about tennis. Actually sometimes they say 
                  the right things, but unfortunately they are not tennis players, 
                  otherwise there would be a lot of genius on the court. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER: </b>Just about playing Wayne Ferreira tomorrow, 
                  how do you feel about that? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> He was a top 10. He won here and also he surprised 
                  a lot with his big return. So he can play from the baseline. 
                  He is a good volleyer. It will be tough, but I beat him once, 
                  one year ago, a long time ago, but it will be different and 
                  it's just a question of to be patient and just to do your things. 
                  You can't expect to beat him very easily because a semifinal. 
                  He's also got a lot of confidence. He beat Krajicek, Kafelnikov. 
                  I don't know who he beat before, but it means that he's in good 
                  conditions. So I will just have to play like today, I played 
                  a hundred per cent. I just was -- I knew what I need to do, 
                  I was concentrated. I think if I play like this, playing right 
                  tactically, you can do it. I mean you can't expect very much, 
                  but I hope if I will do well my job, I will come, I will play 
                  right. I think I can beat him. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>TOUR OFFICIAL: </b>Okay. So that's everybody. Thanks a lot.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> Thank you<br>
