                    <b><br>
                    GREG SHARKO:</b> Marat is appearing in his fifth ATP Tour 
                    final of the season, and with a win tomorrow, he'll tie Lleyton 
                    Hewitt for the tour lead in titles this season. He also has 
                    a 3-1 lifetime advantage against Kuerten, and in the previous 
                    four matches they all went down to the final set, three of 
                    them in a fifth set. All right, first question?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> When you -- when all those break points got away 
                    from you at the beginning, did you think it wasn't going to 
                    be your night?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> I had so many break points first few games, 
                    and it was -- I was scared, that's it, I just -- I had to 
                    -- to calm down a little bit because it's -- I had to -- I 
                    had to -- too much respect to him on the court, it's not -- 
                    it's nothing personal, but just, you know, to the player, 
                    he's -- was top 10, he's -- he's 11th in the world, so he 
                    serves well, very good game, so it gets you a little bit under 
                    pressure from the beginning. And then that's what -- what 
                    was the problem, I couldn't return second serve. After I just 
                    -- at the end of the first set, I just calmed down and I said 
                    -- I just had to return the second serve and tried to -- to 
                    play the point because I'm -- I think I'm better than him 
                    on the baseline. So was -- it was a question of time to wait, 
                    wait, wait, and after -- when I have an opportunity, just 
                    to try to return inside the court, and without big shots, 
                    tried to make the point, that was how it was. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> How are you playing this week, your run in Toronto 
                    a couple weeks ago, do you feel like you're playing as well 
                    as you were that week?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> That's another week. I mean, it was two weeks 
                    ago I played in Toronto. I already forget about this tournament, 
                    otherwise you're going to (inaudible) "Yes, I was once in 
                    the final." I mean, it was another week, another chance to 
                    win the tournament. I have to try, I mean, to -- to play a 
                    game, and I want to win another tournament, why not? So you 
                    don't think about the weeks after, you start to think about 
                    tomorrow and today. It's just -- you have to improve your 
                    game. You can't stop. You have to -- with every match you 
                    have to improve something, try and to do something more that 
                    you know.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Marat, what concerns you about taking on Gustavo 
                    tomorrow, about his game?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> When we play each other, I mean, it's -- it's 
                    always a tough match, three times in the first set and two 
                    times I think -- or two times in the third one, so it was 
                    -- it's -- no, it was three -- or four matches we played, 
                    three in the first set and one in the third. And so the same 
                    game. Too much pressure since the beginning, who going to 
                    be -- who going to start better. I'm going to -- going to 
                    play better, I think, because he plays -- he doesn't let his 
                    play -- because he plays very fast, he try to -- he doesn't 
                    -- he doesn't give you any time to think. He plays very -- 
                    inside the court, very fast points, so you have to be -- be 
                    careful and pay more attention from the first game. And after, 
                    I mean, if I will do it from the first game, it will -- the 
                    same, you have to wait until your opportunities will -- will 
                    come. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> What was it that you did those three matches that 
                    let you win since they were so close? What was the difference 
                    that worked for you?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> Just the first three matches it's -- you always 
                    -- first match you get nervous, second match you try to -- 
                    to play a little bit better, and, of course, with a little 
                    more -- a little bit of more confidence, you play better. 
                    And after you just -- you try -- you try to play a little 
                    bit -- you try to find something new, because everybody knows 
                    how to play against you, against Tim, against me, against 
                    Gustavo. So you try to make it a little bit like practice, 
                    try to go to the net, try to -- to put the pressure with serve 
                    and volleys sometimes, because otherwise it's -- if you don't 
                    try anything else, I mean, it's -- the -- the players, they 
                    going to know how to play against you. So you try -- you -- 
                    I want to try a little bit more, go to the net, play a little 
                    bit -- try to make the point, serve and volley, try to improve 
                    something on my game. You can't do it only in practice, you 
                    have to do it on the court. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Do you feel like you're playing your best tennis 
                    right now?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN </b>Probably. I mean, it's not a question of if 
                    it's my best tennis, it's a question of how long you can play 
                    like this, which is more important in the U.S. Open, yeah? 
                    Because I want to be 100 percent. In one week I want to play 
                    there, I want to make some big results. I'm not coming there 
                    to make second round, third round, I'm coming there to win 
                    a tournament, like everybody. So I will try to do -- to be 
                    100 percent there, physically, mentally, and with everything, 
                    I want to go there, with all my hopes. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> You're 3-1 against him. What did you change since 
                    you met him last time, in your game? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN </b>Nothing changed, I just started to return a 
                    little bit better, that's it. And because it -- I play against 
                    him two years ago, I mean, he has a big serve, and for me 
                    it was something -- something different because I never return 
                    these -- these serves two years ago, I played Challenger at 
                    the beginning of the year, so nobody serves like this. That 
                    was in '98, no? Sorry. But still nobody serves like this. 
                    And now I have more experience, and I'm returning much better, 
                    and I already know how to play against him, and it's a little 
                    bit -- it's much easier to play like this. I know what I have 
                    to do. I know that they have to put him on the baseline, make 
                    the point, I don't have to rush, of course, he doesn't make 
                    big winners. He's trying to do, so -- make a point, but I'm 
                    much better on the baseline, like he is much better on the 
                    net than me. And it was -- it's like this.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>What did you change in training since -- <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> Nothing, nothing I change.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Since you worked with Andrei Chesnokov? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> Nothing changed also, nothing. What changed? 
                    I'm not making serve and volleys, I just -- I'm working on 
                    the same things that he did -- he told me and also my -- my 
                    first calls he told me. But I'm trying to do it for my own, 
                    also with the help of Alexander Volkov, it's just a big help 
                    for me. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Is Alexander with you at the U.S. Open? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> Yeah <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>GREG SHARKO:</b> Anything else for Marat. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> Yes?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> If you would win tomorrow, not having Agassi or 
                    Sampras here, will that take away anything from the championship?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> What's it going to change? Sorry, but, I mean, 
                    we also play tennis here, and I think we're not playing worser 
                    than them, than Pete and Andre. It's just going to be two 
                    guys more, so what? Why I have to be scared? No, I think I'm 
                    playing quite well. Also we have Gustavo Kuerten, we have 
                    Tim Henman, and some other guys they're playing at this moment 
                    I think a little bit better than Pete and Andre. As you can 
                    see the results of last weeks, I think they're playing much 
                    better than them. But they -- so I'm not afraid. Also they 
                    will try to prepare a little bit more for U.S. Open, so you 
                    will see the real Agassi and the real Sampras in the Open, 
                    not this week, not another one, but still we -- we're playing 
                    while -- one of the best tennis in the world, with Tim, with 
                    Kuerten, with Hewitt, I think with -- of course it's -- it 
                    would be much nicer for the people, but I mean, we don't -- 
                    we're not afraid of them. Sorry. <br>
