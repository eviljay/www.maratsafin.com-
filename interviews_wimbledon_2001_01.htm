                    MODERATOR: Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen. Could I introduce 
                    Marat Safin. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How do you rate your play at the moment on grass? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: It's very difficult to play the first match of 
                    Wimbledon because it's a little bit difficult because you 
                    don't know actually the opponent very well. Of course, you 
                    are a little bit nervous because the first match, you want 
                    to win it, you want to get the confidence back. It's a little 
                    bit tough. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How do you rate your game today? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I could play better, I think. But I'm satisfied 
                    what I did. I won. I think it's enough. It was enough for 
                    today. I hope I'll play better next day - hopefully.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Is it harder to break a racquet on a grass court?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I try. No, it's very difficult (smiling). <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. I think you're up to it. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, I will try definitely. For you, I will 
                    try. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Was that the first time you played Knowle?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yes. But I knew him from four years ago, we played 
                    some challengers together. I knew more or less how he's playing. 
                    He can play great tennis, I think. He's a good player.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Do you think you underestimated him?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Of course, it's a little bit tough. To go to 
                    the court, to look at the ranking, it's 150 in the world. 
                    You think, &quot;Yeah, anyway I'm going to beat him.&quot; 
                    At least it's good one way because you have confidence. Another 
                    way it's not good, because if he play very good tennis, you 
                    don't wait for it. It can be surprise. But he surprise me 
                    a little bit because he was twice a break up - second and 
                    the third set. I had to concentrate a little bit more just 
                    to finish the match, otherwise I could be in big trouble in 
                    the fifth set.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You look at this guy, two hands both ways, &quot;God, no, 
                    not another one&quot;? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Santoro (laughter). No, he's playing a different 
                    way. I'm happy. He's hitting the ball. At least he lets you 
                    play. You have some rhythm. It was okay for first match of 
                    Grand Slam, of Wimbledon. Is okay. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How unhappy are you on grass? Does Mats Wilander help to 
                    change both your approach and your mental outlook in the game?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: How you can be, I mean happy? What's mean happy? 
                    If you winning, you happy. If you're losing, you not happy. 
                    It's this way. The way you're playing, you know, you can't 
                    be happy on the first round if you make four sets. You cannot 
                    be definitely happy. But you trying. You trying. You have 
                    nothing to lose anyway. Nobody expects anything from you. 
                    They put me even fourth seed. I was surprised, I was shocked. 
                    &quot;Good, thanks a lot.&quot; Give me another chance to 
                    play on grass. Yeah, keep trying. I think it's going to work. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Are you serving with a hundred percent power right now?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yes.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Hundred percent?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, yeah, I'm trying (laughter). <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Has the real Marat Safin returned? We've been waiting a 
                    long time. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but not yet. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Not quite yet?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Not. I need some time, to win some matches. It's 
                    difficult to play without confidence at all. I mean, you're 
                    not playing best. I'm not playing very best tennis. I'm far 
                    from there. You need to go slowly, try to get the confidence. 
                    It's very difficult.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Are you confident that you'll regain confidence?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I'm confident -- I was confident today, but I 
                    don't think I'm going to be confident against Nestor. I'm 
                    not sure yet if I'm confident or not. I need to win some matches. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Mats Wilander, has he taught you patience on grass? How 
                    has he changed your mental attitude? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: How he can change that, the person? I mean, he 
                    just can explain to me the way I have to play, but he cannot 
                    teach me. He can show me. Actually, it's me. I have to understand 
                    it.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. But you have a very positive relationship with him as your 
                    coach?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, of course.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. And does he have anything extra to teach you about playing 
                    on grass?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Extra? I don't know. Nothing special. I mean, 
                    what do you have to teach on grass? It's very bad, fast hard 
                    court. Let's put it this way. Very, very bad hard court, and 
                    very fast. That's it. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Are the balls bouncing higher than you recall?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: The balls this year are a little bit heavy. Everybody 
                    has some problems with the shoulders, with the arm. Lot of 
                    guys, they are suffering a little bit because they're too 
                    heavy. It's not nice actually to play with these balls. They 
                    are like stones.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What do you know about Nestor? What do you expect playing 
                    against him? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Good doubles specialist, no? Lefty, which is 
                    not very nice. But, yeah, it's one more match. Try to beat 
                    him. Doesn't matter. I mean, I want to play, I want to win. 
                    I think it's enough to try to beat him. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What advice would you have for somebody that wanted to 
                    go to one of the legal betting shops and bet on Marat Safin 
                    to win the tournament?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Don't do it (laughter).<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Don't do it?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No. I don't want to be a bad guy in this situation, 
                    no. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. No chance for somebody who bets on you?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No, no, no, no. Otherwise I would bet on myself.
