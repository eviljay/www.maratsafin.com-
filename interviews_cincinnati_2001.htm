                  Guillermo Canas (Arg) - Marat Safin (Rus) 6-3, 6-3 <br>
                  <br>
                  An Interview With: MARAT SAFIN </b><br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  MODERATOR: Okay. Questions?<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Can you just talk about the match a little bit and what happened? 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: Which match? No. I played bad, and just nothing more 
                  I can talk about anything. I played bad, and that's it. Not 
                  many things happened, actually. It was quite fast, quite -- 
                  nothing happened and bad. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. How were you feeling physically today? <br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: I'm okay physically. I'm okay. Just nothing happened, 
                  you know. Nothing. Absolutely. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Are you at a point where you're just searching for answers 
                  trying to find your game again at this point?<br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: I'm trying, but it's -- it doesn't come. I can't do anything. 
                  I have my coach. I have my fitness coach. I have everybody. 
                  It's just not coming. I can do many things, keep trying and 
                  keep trying until it comes or it doesn't come. I have to try, 
                  you know. Today, I tried, but it's just nothing happens. I lost 
                  and that's made a difference between a good player and the player 
                  in a situation where I am right now. It's bad, but hopefully 
                  I can find a way<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Are you hoping, you're going back to some places where you've 
                  had some success and last summer all along was so good for you, 
                  but you got runner-up in Indianapolis before winning the Open. 
                  Are you hoping that maybe to catch some fire there with just 
                  a little time off here and building up confidence, finding your 
                  confidence? <br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: Yeah, but anyway you have to play so much because practice 
                  is one thing and the match is another thing. Because if you 
                  practice for two weeks because next week is Indianapolis and 
                  if you practice for two weeks, you are a little bit too tired. 
                  And the matches, it's like practice, practice three or four 
                  days, you try one more time it doesn't come, and you keep trying 
                  and nothing happens. I'm sorry, but it has to come. I'm doing 
                  the right things, and my coach is satisfied with the work I'm 
                  doing. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Do you feel maybe you're putting a little bit too much pressure 
                  on yourself to get it back maybe too soon or whatever, maybe 
                  because the U.S. Open is coming up and stuff? <br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: Really, seriously, I don't really care. I don't really 
                  care where I'm going to finish. If I'm not defending my title 
                  in U.S. Open and I'm not win the title in the finals, I don't 
                  really care, because the numbers doesn't matter anymore. I did 
                  a lot of things last year and it's actually it's not bad. So 
                  these are only titles. I don't care about numbers. I don't care 
                  about my ranking. It's just a matter of finding your game, try 
                  to win some tournaments; and sure, when I play, I would like 
                  to win. I don't even know how many points I have right now. 
                  Losing, it doesn't matter. What make the difference if you're 
                  playing bad and you're number 3, or you're playing bad and you're 
                  number 30? You're bad. Doesn't matter. Just the problem is to 
                  try to find the confidence back and try to win some matches 
                  and try to find the game. Then I can talk about numbers, ranking, 
                  and all this thing. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Seems like more and more first rounders are a problem. I 
                  mean, are first round matches scarier than they used to be for 
                  you? Is there more tension in first rounders now?<br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: Before, it was, I think, more like it was pressure, but 
                  I think I'm not anymore junior. I'm not anymore the guy who 
                  is just a rising star from Russia. I already did good things 
                  so I have already my level. I was dropping, but still I have 
                  my name and I am still -- at least they still recognize me on 
                  the streets which is not too bad. This gives you some confidence. 
                  But it's not pressure anymore. It's just a thing that I would 
                  like to win again. That's it. It will come. It has to come. 
                  With the coach, it will have to come. It has to come. Otherwise, 
                  I'm not good enough for this -- for tennis, you know. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Do you feel, at this point, you say you're doing all the 
                  right things. Do you think it's all pretty much mental at this 
                  point, the strokes and everything else? <br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: It's the strokes, it's the mental things. I spend hours 
                  and hours on the court. You have to; trailers, cross-courts. 
                  It's just routine, everyday. I just keep playing, keep playing, 
                  keep trying in tournaments. It has to come. I'm not struggling 
                  so badly that I can't play anymore. Yeah, I can. It's just nothing 
                  happens. But still, I'm there. I'm trying and I'm in top 10, 
                  which is a very good thing. At least this is good. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. What do you think about Cincinnati? <br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: Too hot. I just have to find my answer. Just completely 
                  went out and difficult to play here. But it's, I think it's 
                  a very good place to concentrate on tennis because it's actually 
                  not many things to do. But I think it's perfect for practice, 
                  for preparation. You can work a little bit harder because it's 
                  too hot. The conditions are tough so you prepare yourself for 
                  the next tournament. I think it's good. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. How do you think he played today? Did he do – <br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: He was playing great. The guy was 240 in the world at 
                  the beginning of the year because he had some injuries and the 
                  guy, I don't know his ranking, 30, 40? He's playing great. He 
                  makes finals in Stuttgart in the summer against Kuerten, and 
                  I think he's really, he steps into next level because he was 
                  the guy, like, 70, 80, nothing special. You play against him 
                  and normally you win. Now he's a very good player and he gets 
                  some respect.<br>
                  Q. Did you hurt your hand?<br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: Huh? <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Did you hurt your hand in the second set? <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: I have no more excuses, nothing. Yeah, I hurt my hand. 
                  But I'm bad. I can't say anything. I'm just bad. Okay?<br>
                  <br>
                  MODERATOR: Anything else for Marat? <br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: Okay.<br>
                  <br>
                  MODERATOR: Good luck next week. <br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: See you. <br>
