                  <i>The Russian offers sparkle within a cast of one-dimensional 
                  US Open characters, writes Alix Ramsay. </i><br>
                  <br>
                  For one who is supposed to be wasting his talent, Marat Safin 
                  has not done too badly. He is still but 22, has won a Grand 
                  Slam tournament, has appeared in the final of another, banked 
                  more than 7 million dollars in prize money, and is ranked 2nd 
                  in the world. If only he had eaten his greens and done his homework, 
                  who knows what he could have achieved by now?<br>
                  <br>
                  The Russian thought he had cracked it two years ago. He began 
                  the year charged with &quot;not giving his best effort&quot; 
                  - tanking, for want of a better word - during the Australian 
                  Open. Then, with a change of coach and a new attitude, he started 
                  winning tournaments and marched on New York and the US Open 
                  with nothing to lose. He had a sneaking suspicion that he could 
                  beat anyone, given half a chance. Eventually, he overcame Pete 
                  Sampras in the final, and suddenly he was one of the big boys.<br>
                  <br>
                  On occasion he has shown signs of rediscovering that form, but 
                  it has not lasted long. In Melbourne in Jan, the path seemed 
                  clear towards the Aust Open, but it did not happen. Confused 
                  messages from his doctor left him feeling lethargic in the semi-finals, 
                  a bevy of blondes who followed his every footstep proved a distraction, 
                  and Thomas Johansson proved too strong in the final when Safin 
                  seemed unable to hit a barn door at 10 paces.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now he is heading back to Flushing Meadow with his confidence 
                  wearing thin, and the world whispering &quot;wastrel&quot; as 
                  he passes. That is his greatest problem - everyone seems to 
                  know what is best for his 6ft 4in, 14 st affable frame. They 
                  tut-tut - if only he has a regular coach.... if only he practised 
                  more.... if only he would concentrate.... And they are driving 
                  him potty.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Im living my life&quot; he reflects. &quot;Im not living 
                  the life of anybody else. I know what im doing, and ive been 
                  doing it for a long time. The better I get, the more people 
                  like this I get. They advise me to get a coach, to do like this, 
                  to live like this; I should do this, I should wake up at this 
                  time or go to sleep at that time; dont eat this. If I were winning 
                  five Grand Slams and being No1 for a long time, the people will 
                  still say that I can be much better. You have to live with this, 
                  and I try not to react to that&quot;.<br>
                  <br>
                  Not that Safin is complaining, merely explaining. He is eloquent 
                  in several languages, funny and a charmer. Unlike so many professional 
                  sportsmen, he does not take himself too seriously.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Im doing bad things, Im doing good things, and im satisfied 
                  with that. Im like any other person in the world who wants to 
                  live his life. Of course im doing stupid things, of course im 
                  making mistakes in my life, so I dont want to be the centre 
                  of attention. Im okay with myself&quot;.<br>
                  <br>
                  That said, he cannot help being the focus of attention - and 
                  not only to his blonde admirers. He is a big man with a big 
                  game and, on his day, he has the beating of anyone. On a bad 
                  day he smashes his racquet, apppeals to the heavens for guidance, 
                  and does not so much wear his heart on his sleeve as give it 
                  to the crowd for safe keeping. He is a celebrity whether he 
                  likes it or not, though he maintains: &quot;A star is in the 
                  sky - and thats it&quot;.<br>
                  <br>
                  His coaching history is rich and varied. From the early days 
                  with Rafael Mensua in Spain, he has moved through Alexei Chesnokov 
                  and Alexander Volkov, stopping briefly to take advice from Mats 
                  Wilander and Tony Pickard. At the moment he is working with 
                  Amit Noah, known in the locker room as &quot;Armpit&quot;. <br>
                  <br>
                  Two years ago, life was simple: happy days when he was one of 
                  the wave of young hopefuls, but a time when no-one expected 
                  anything of him. Now he goes back with a reputation to live 
                  up to; now he is supposed to be able to win. And that can be 
                  hard to live up to, especially when you have to play Nicholas 
                  Kiefer in the 1st round, and possible Gustavo Kuerten in the 
                  2nd.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Its a Grand Slam, you want to win a Grand Slam&quot; he 
                  confirms. &quot;Im counting the Grand Slams. I have one title, 
                  and one final. Its nothing, but every time I play in a Grand 
                  Slam, there is extra motivation to win it. Sometimes its difficult 
                  to play because you want is so badly that it just blocks you; 
                  you cant give your best. And also to finish No 1 in the world, 
                  that what keeps my motivated in tennis.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;But you cannot play with the pressure, you cannot play 
                  great tennis with the pressure. Its difficult. Every time you 
                  go out on the court, already you are thinking: 'I have to win 
                  this match.' Nobody has to win this match, you can lose this 
                  match - its 50-50. It depends how well you play. Thats all.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  He knows that he can win, and he definitely wants to win, but 
                  whether he will reach the second week or not is anybody's guess. 
                  That is the beauty of Safin. All he insists on is the freedom 
                  to enjoy his life as he sees fit. He is young, he is talented 
                  and he is good looking - give the boy a break.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;You never know what's going to happen in your life, and 
                  if you dont enjoy it now, when are you going to enjoy? When 
                  you are 30 and when you are 40, its already too late because 
                  your best years are between 20 and 40. So you have to try to 
                  have fun. Just enjoy it and do whatever you like, and just listen 
                  to the people closest to you. You cant listen to everyone. Just 
                  live, just enjoy&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  In a world of one-dimensional money-makers, tennis needs the 
                  character of Safin more that Safin needs tennis. His philosophy 
                  may not win him the title in 2 weeks time, but no-one can argue 
                  with the engaging logic.<br>
