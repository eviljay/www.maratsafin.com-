                  YORK (AP) -- Slowly, methodically, Marat Safin broke down Todd 
                  Martin's game, taking it apart one piece at a time. And when 
                  he was finished Saturday, the 20-year-old Russian was in the 
                  championship match of the U.S. Open. <br>
                  <br>
                  Mixing his tactics magnificently, Safin displayed huge serves 
                  and the savvy to throw in a changeup every so often. There was 
                  a lob shot here, a drop shot there.<br>
                  <br>
                  It all added up to a 6-3, 7-6 (4), 7-6 (1) victory in the semifinal 
                  and his first chance at a Grand Slam title on Sunday. <br>
                  <br>
                  ``It's nice to be in the final,'' Safin said. ``But something 
                  is missing. I want to win.'' <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin, seeded No. 6, will meet either No. 4 Pete Sampras, seeking 
                  to add to his record 13 major championships, or 19-year-old 
                  Lleyton Hewitt, seeded No. 9, who met in Saturday's other semifinal.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin had Martin, 10 years older, gasping for air on a hot, 
                  humid afternoon at the National Tennis Center.<br>
                  <br>
                  ``He played the big points better than me and he played the 
                  little points better than me,'' Martin said. <br>
                  <br>
                  ``I was fighting an uphill battle all the way. I was tired. 
                  But, gee, if I was at full speed the score could have been the 
                  same.'' <br>
                  <br>
                  President Bill Clinton arrived after the match, too late to 
                  see Safin's display of shotmaking that left Martin with little 
                  chance. <br>
                  The youngster won the first set easily. When Martin rallied 
                  in the second, winning three straight games to get to 5-4, Safin 
                  never blinked. He shrugged off set point, pushed it to a tiebreaker 
                  and won it 7-4. Martin, the Open's marathon man, shed his baseball 
                  cap for the third set but it didn't help. His energy just ran 
                  out, his task complicated by Safin's lobs, drops and passes.<br>
                  <br>
                  ``I've been here for three weeks,'' Martin said. <br>
                  <br>
                  ``It's like renting a car. I'm going back to the airport empty.''<br>
                  <br>
                  A finalist at the Open a year ago, Martin had flourished in 
                  long matches, including a five-set, 4-hour, 17-minute victory 
                  over Carlos Moya in the round of 16. Then there was a four-setter 
                  against Thomas Johansson in the quarterfinals.<br>
                  Back on center court two days later, Martin didn't have a lot 
                  left in his tank against Safin, who is 6-foot-4 and a mirror 
                  image of the 6-6, American baseliner.<br>
                  Safin was simply younger, faster and stronger. He boomed serves 
                  of up to 133 mph but also showed touch.<br>
                  <br>
                  In the first set, Safin tossed in a gorgeous drop shot to get 
                  to set point. It was a statement shot, a reminder that even 
                  though he's young, his game is mature, capable of dealing with 
                  every situation.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin could not escape his reputation for having a short fuse, 
                  though. When he was broken in the second set, he flung his racket 
                  in anger. Last year, he broke 48 of them but he had not tossed 
                  one at the Open since his first-round victory over Thierry Guardiola. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin recovered the racket, used it to win the next point and 
                  then decided it was in no shape to go on and switched to a new 
                  one. It was just as effective as the original.<br>
                  <br>
                  In the third set, with Martin's shirt and shorts soaked in sweat, 
                  Safin kept him cornered. In one game, he sent a lob over Martin's 
                  head that kissed the back line and then found the sideline as 
                  he dashed for a return.<br>
                  <br>
                  It added up to another break that Martin couldn't afford. In 
                  the third set, Safin sent a shot whistling over the net, forcing 
                  Martin to duck. It was the appropriate reaction against a player 
                  who had more firepower and knew how to use it. To his credit, 
                  Martin was tenacious.<br>
                  <br>
                  Serving to stay in the match, he won a crucial third-set game, 
                  forcing Safin to stay on the court for an extra few games. <br>
                  The set went to a tiebreaker that Safin won 7-1, and he ended 
                  it aptly with his 13th ace and his fastest serve of the day 
                  -- 133 mph.<br>
                  <br>
                  ``I was tight. I was very nervous,'' Safin said. <br>
                  <br>
                  ``I saw 133. That was enough.'' <br>
