                    <b><br>
                    GREG SHARKO:</b> Okay, Marat makes a successful debut here 
                    and he'll move into the third round where he plays Karim Alami. 
                    Okay, first question? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> You visited this tournament in 1990, I believe, 
                    right?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> '90? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> In '90. How does it feel to be playing in this tournament 
                    after you came and watched it 10 years ago?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> It was just a -- from a different view, it 
                    was a tournament. I was like a spectator, now I'm like a player. 
                    It's almost the same, it's just that you are acting and the 
                    people are coming to watch you. So you're trying to give all 
                    your best and sometimes -- sometimes it's going great, sometimes 
                    it's a little bit difficult. Today wasn't a very good match 
                    for the people. We didn't make big rallies and we didn't play 
                    very well like we can play because I think it's the first 
                    day, we get a little bit nervous because it's the first match 
                    of the tournament, you want to -- it's always difficult to 
                    pass because normally the -- the most important, first two 
                    rounds. And after, when you get the confidence, when you win 
                    these two rounds, then it's a completely different game and 
                    you start to play better, you feel on the court a little bit 
                    more normal than -- than today because it's too big, the court, 
                    so sometimes you hit the ball and it's because of distance, 
                    it's not -- it's not normal one like we used to play because 
                    it's huge. So, I mean, you miss some easy balls because, you 
                    know, too much space and you don't know where to hit. And 
                    it's a little bit -- small things become a little bit -- a 
                    small problem. So it's -- first two days is more difficult. 
                    And then you get -- you get confidence, you come back, and 
                    you make a great game, and the people, they enjoy watching 
                    you.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Can you think of any other courts, any other tournaments 
                    that have such a big -- <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> No, because in -- normally, because it's a 
                    big background, how do you say, from the baseline to -- because 
                    it's big and also from the side.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> It's wide too.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> It's very wide. So it's too much space. And 
                    it's a little bit -- you can't assimilate where is the court, 
                    and sometimes it's difficult to play, but you just have to 
                    be concentrated and try to make it faster. Otherwise it's 
                    getting more and more -- more problems, if you lose your serve, 
                    you start with one player don't want to play, so you try to 
                    be a little bit more concentrated, you want to finish fast, 
                    so you're trying to do all your best, and like this you come 
                    -- like this is coming back, the confidence.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> What's your coaching situation now? At French you 
                    were working with Chesnokov, and I believe that's on a -- 
                    over?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> No, I don't have any coach yet because now 
                    it's difficult to find a -- the guy who can travel with you 
                    and just -- <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Is that the problem with Andrei? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> Yeah, because he has a family, I mean, he has 
                    two kids, he has a wife, he is living -- he has a great life 
                    in Paris. This guy, he knows. So I think it's much better 
                    -- he is much better in Paris with his family than travelling 
                    with me from tournament to tournament, because he did it for 
                    10 years ago, I think, since he was 19, 18. So it's a little 
                    bit difficult. But I'm just starting, so I have time, I don't 
                    have -- I don't have to rush because everything will come. 
                    I'm not -- I don't want to make a big problem from this, because 
                    otherwise you get crazy when you start to -- you just have 
                    to -- making what you know, trying to do -- try to practice. 
                    And at least I know -- I have enough experience and enough 
                    brain to -- to do this by myself. And here I stay with Alexander 
                    Volkov, he's just taking care of me and -- <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>So it's just you as a friend? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> Yeah, just a friend.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> (Inaudible) <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN </b>No, just -- yeah, sometimes because he plays 
                    so it's normal. But just at the U.S. Open because I don't 
                    have anybody and I didn't want to come here alone, that's 
                    the problem. And after from -- after America I will -- I will 
                    see.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> So he will stay with you till the end of the U.S. 
                    Open?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> Until the U.S. Open, that's it. And after I 
                    will go by myself.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> I read that Shamil Tarpetsev had offered his services. 
                    Is that true?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> Who told you this? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Read it in a Moscow newspaper. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> No, never, I never -- it's -- I don't want. 
                    And I don't actually need -- I mean, he was -- he's a great 
                    coach, he was with a Russian team, he was with Chesnokov, 
                    with Volkov, he was the captain, but, I mean, he has a business 
                    in Russia. He doesn't have to travel with me, he doesn't have 
                    to -- you know, he can give me some advices, but I don't need 
                    his help because I will -- I can do it by myself. I need to 
                    find the right guy, a young one like -- like Alexander, he 
                    is a little bit -- a little bit more of my generation. So 
                    I don't want to -- you know, it's a big difference with the 
                    age. So it's a little bit -- it would be a little bit difficult. 
                    He has a different -- different mind than mine. So it -- it 
                    will not work anyways. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> So you're still based in Spain, then? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> No, Monte Carlo.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Monte Carlo. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> I moved there.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> When did you move?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> When? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Yes. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> Two months ago. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> How has Ion Tiriac, who is now your manager, how 
                    has that changed things compared to when you were IMG ?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> I don't want to offend anybody, I don't want 
                    to be in a -- you know, in a misunderstanding, but I think 
                    it's -- I'm sure their job is okay. Like I was two years with 
                    them. Some things that I didn't like, but it's normal, everybody 
                    has these problems. So it was just a -- I changed something, 
                    I went to Ion (phonetic), he said -- yeah, well, he took me, 
                    and I think it's going really well because he's not a big 
                    company like IMG, also Advantage, they have a lot of players, 
                    so it's a little bit -- it's difficult to have all attention 
                    from your agent. So now I'm a -- we are only two guys with 
                    Ion, there's Goran and me, so I have more attention. If I 
                    have something, I just have to call them. Because I get in 
                    contact very fast if I need -- if I need help, I have some 
                    problems, I just have to call and that's it. I have 24 hours, 
                    there are 24 hours in a day -- on the phone, so it's much 
                    easier for me and much easier for them, you know, one or two, 
                    so it's not a big problem to get the rackets, shoes, just 
                    -- making, I think, a great job managing.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Ion usually has lots of opinions about things. Has 
                    he given you --<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> Yeah. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> -- his opinions on a coach for you?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> I mean, he was with Vilas, he was with Becker, 
                    with Goran, he has a lot of experience, he was also a player. 
                    So it's good to hear him. Sometimes he's telling you some 
                    -- is right things, sometimes you have to decide by yourself, 
                    but basically I think he has big experience, so you need to 
                    listen if you want to be -- if you have to be -- if you want 
                    to be a clever guy, because -- I mean, so many years in tennis, 
                    he knows many things. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> So what does he say about you having a coach? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> I don't have to rush. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> That's what he said?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> Yeah, because he's not the -- I'm doing not 
                    so bad for the moment. I won Toronto without any coaching. 
                    It's not -- so I can play by myself. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Is it important for you to have a Russian coach? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN </b>No.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Do you think it would be priority for you to have 
                    a Russian? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> I don't think so. It's not -- it's important 
                    to find the guy who will understand you, who will -- you know, 
                    he will be for you there on the court or anywhere 24 hours, 
                    will be, you know, travelling with you, sleeping in the same 
                    room because some -- for some guys it's -- you know -- but 
                    sometimes, you know, you have to stay in the same room. I 
                    don't know, it's difficult, but I hope I'll find it soon. 
                    But I think it's not a problem. I can travel by myself. And 
                    one day I will find somebody. Otherwise, I don't know. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>You'll just keep winning on your own? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN </b>Yeah, by myself. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>GREG SHARKO:</b> Anything else for Marat? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Did your victory against Sampras change something 
                    for you? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> Nothing, I'm just still playing tennis, that's 
                    it. Just give me more experience. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Was it a very important match for you or -- <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> I think yes, I just -- in the ranking I move, 
                    you know, too far, it gave me confidence. I know that I can 
                    beat him now, and I'm not afraid of him, and just I respect 
                    him like a player, but still I know that I can play against 
                    these kind of guys Krajicek, Rusedski, Sampras, with a big 
                    serve, so I can return, I know that they have -- I can have 
                    enough concentration during all the match, and just -- it 
                    gives me big confidence also to win this tournament in Toronto. 
                    It was great. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Except the day with Santoro? right? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> Santoro, I -- I cannot play against him, definitely.
