                  An interview with: MARAT SAFIN </b><br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  MODERATOR: Questions for Marat. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. How was that out there today? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Tough. First match, you know, big tournament, third 
                  match of the year, so you're kind of nervous and you try to 
                  win in straight sets. You have a tough opponent. The guy can 
                  play great tennis. He beat Hewitt in Stockholm. <br>
                  But was okay, you know. Just I lost a little bit my concentration 
                  on second set, that's why I lost. But I knew what I have to 
                  do, and I came back. I think I played great third and fourth 
                  set - good enough to win. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. How do you feel with your shoulder? Do you feel it's going 
                  to come through okay? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I'm taking care of it. I'm taking some antiinflammatories, 
                  Vioxx. But it's okay. The pain is going away. It's much better, 
                  much better. Like next match I think will be perfect then. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Have you thought anything about last year? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Last year is the history already. It was one year 
                  ago. The time is running. Is another chance, another year, another 
                  tournament. Just I would like to do the same thing. It's difficult 
                  because another year. You are not playing the same tennis. The 
                  other people are not playing the same tennis. The situation 
                  is difficult. <br>
                  But I'll be there. I'm still in the draw. I think I still have 
                  a great potential to do well here, and we'll see if I will be 
                  able to make it. Because other people, they also know how to 
                  play tennis. <br>
                  But I want to do well here, definitely. I will give all my best. 
                  I will try my best. It doesn't matter if I will play my great 
                  tennis, if I will play bad, but I will be there, I will be tough 
                  and I will give trouble to everybody, that's for sure. Then 
                  if I will win or I will lose, then it's just we'll see on the 
                  court. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. What was the biggest celebration or most enjoyable celebration 
                  after winning the Davis Cup? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: It's tough. It's tough to celebrate straightaway 
                  because even we went out to the club, and from 12:00 that we 
                  got into the club until I think 3:00, I was signing autographs, 
                  so I didn't have any chance to celebrate at all. I was making 
                  pictures, I was doing everything, but definitely not taking 
                  care of myself. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Were you signing autographs for pretty girls? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: No, pretty boys I was signing. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. The court is supposed to be faster this year. Firstly, do 
                  you agree? Secondly, how much does that help you in winning 
                  the title? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: It is definitely faster. Of course, the bounce 
                  is a little bit lower. It's good for my game. It's good for 
                  me. I'm really far from winning this tournament still. First 
                  I have to pass the first week. First it's difficult to pass 
                  the first round. Then you have to pass to the second week. Then, 
                  of course, is a matter of luck, just if you get your game, if 
                  you get your best shape, and then you can see. <br>
                  I will tell you if I have opportunity to win the tournament 
                  in the second week if I get there. Then I will see my chances, 
                  see if I'm playing great tennis or not, see how the other players 
                  are playing. <br>
                  But I'm sure I can do well. I'm sure. I hope also. I hope so. 
                  <br>
                  But it's good. It's good. The courts are -- I think for my game, 
                  they're really good. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Are you surprised that Larsson is giving Hewitt a lot of 
                  problems? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: He beat me last year, Larsson -- sorry, two years 
                  ago. He's a great player. He's I think one of the most talented 
                  players on tour. He's from old generation. He beat Sampras in 
                  Masters -- not the Masters, in Grand Slam Cup, in Munich there 
                  was a tournament, in the finals. It means he's a great player. 
                  He can give some trouble. He can be dangerous. <br>
                  Again, he have a good serve, good forehand, he can also play 
                  backhand, great volley. But for some reasons he didn't do well, 
                  didn't give his best to the tennis. I felt for me he was one 
                  of the best players on the world, definitely. He could be, I 
                  think, easily No. 1, but for some reasons he couldn't make it. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Do you think Yevgeny, who said he was going to retire, you 
                  get upset, you try so hard to win the Davis Cup for him, then 
                  he says, &quot;I'm going to keep playing&quot;? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: That is the question is everybody asking me, even 
                  the players. I think, my opinion, he just said that he wants 
                  to retire, but then he realized that what he's going to do after 
                  he will retired. For example, he's not playing any more tennis. 
                  What he has to do in Moscow, Russia, whatever country he is 
                  living in? <br>
                  It's difficult to find this new job or new thing, you know, 
                  to discover a new thing in your life because you have to change 
                  your life completely. You've been playing tennis since you are 
                  six, and suddenly you just want to change something. You need 
                  to prepare yourself. You need to see what you like, what you 
                  don't like, what you want to do, what you feel like doing. And 
                  then, of course, slowly you can leave tennis. <br>
                  But he has nothing to do. You know, the guy has been playing 
                  for tennis and he didn't prepare himself for the life after 
                  tennis. Of course, he found himself just he doesn't know what 
                  to do. So is the best thing to play tennis and try to prepare 
                  yourself for next life. I think he still can play few years, 
                  two years for sure. He's 29. Let's see how he's doing. <br>
                  <br>
