                        Top seed Marat Safin wasted two match points and was knocked 
                        out of the Stella Artois tournament 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 by Dutchman 
                        Peter Wessels on Thursday. <br>
                        The towering Russian, the reigning U.S. Open champion, 
                        got off to a good start in the third round match but Wessels's 
                        grasscourt expertise told as the match wore on.<br>
                        Wessels, ranked 102 in the world, grabbed the first mini-break 
                        in the decisive tie-break, only for Safin to snatch it 
                        back and secure a first match point. <br>
                        It was saved by the Dutchman, who saved one more with 
                        a sliding serve before clinching victory when Safin poked 
                        a backhand volley into the net. <br>
                        Safin said he was pleased with his performance. &quot;I 
                        don't know why everyone says Safin can't play on grass,&quot; 
                        he said.<br>
                        &quot;Basically I think I was a little bit unlucky. Come 
                        on, it was a three-set match and I had two match points.&quot; 
                        <br>
                        The world No. 3 does not plan any more tournaments before 
                        Wimbledon on June 25. <br>
                        &quot;No...believe me, one week on grass is enough...more 
                        than enough,&quot; Safin smiled. <br>
                        The Russian said he planned to play two grasscourt exhibition 
                        matches next week and practice on a fast indoor court 
                        to fine-tune his timing.<br>

                        Top-seeded Marat Safin recovered from a shaky start in 
                        his first match on grass this season to beat Jens Knippschild 
                        4-6, 7-6 (5), 6-2 in the second round at the Queen's Club 
                        tournament Tuesday.<br>
                        &quot; It's my first match on grass and of course it's 
                        very difficult. The first set it was very tough but then 
                        at the end I got confident,'' Safin said.<br>
                        The Russian, who won the U.S. Open last year, is being 
                        coached by former player Mats Wilander. <br>
                        &quot;I think he's helping me a lot and I'm very happy 
                        to be working with him. It's a big honor,'' Safin said. 
                        &quot;I'm very happy with the job we are doing right now. 
                        I think we will work (together) for a few years.''<br>

                        Top seed Marat Safin of Russia tries to bounce back from 
                        a disappointing French Open on Tuesday when he plays Jens 
                        Knippschild of Germany in the second round at the $775,000 
                        Stella Artois Championships, a warmup tournament for Wimbledon.<br>
                        Safin lost in five sets to Fabrice Santoro in the third 
                        round in Paris, and is without a title this season after 
                        winning an ATP-high seven last year. He is struggling 
                        to overcome back problems incurred during the final of 
                        the Dubai Tennis Championships in early March.<br>
                        Safin, who recently shaved his head clean, received a 
                        first-round bye as one of the top eight seeds. He is 2-0 
                        all-time against Knippschild.<br>

                        2000 U.S. Open champion Marat Safin lost to Fabrice Santoro 
                        of France 6-4 6-4 4-6 0-6 6-1 in the third round of Roland 
                        Garros on Saturday. <br>
                        Even though Santoro had beaten him five out of six times 
                        coming into the match, it was the pair's first meeting 
                        on clay and Marat Safin had vowed to stay focused during 
                        the match. But after a disastrous fifth set in which he 
                        committed 19 unforced errors - many of them on sitters 
                        - the No2-seeded Safin stormed off the court in disgust 
                        and quickly left the facility without talking to the press, 
                        for which he was fined $10,000.<br>
                        &quot;I respect Marat for what he accomplished last year, 
                        but he has to grow up as a mature person because his attitude 
                        is not quite professional,&quot; Safin's Russian compatriot 
                        Yevgeny Kafelnikov said before the match. &quot;I'm strongly 
                        hoping that he's going to change his attitude and understand 
                        that sometimes success is in the past. He has to try to 
                        move on.&quot; <br>
                        &quot;He's not as confident as he once was, but he's still 
                        a great player,&quot; said Santoro. &quot;He hasn't won 
                        as much this year so his confidence rises and falls quickly.&quot; 
                        Santoro lost control of the contest in the third set, 
                        when he couldn't hold on to a 4-2 lead. But after Safin 
                        broke him to open the fifth set, Santoro ran off six straight 
                        games by playing nearly error-free tennis and keeping 
                        the ball low with wicked slice shots. <br>

                        This may not be the 28-year-old Santoro's last appearance 
                        on Chatrier Court, but the cagey Frenchmen doesn't have 
                        too many dates left. His best result at home was reaching 
                        the fourth round in '91, a decent but not great result 
                        for someone who has spent most of his career in the top 
                        50. <br>
                        With a bad back and shaky confidence, Safin is primed 
                        to fall early this year, but given that he nearly gagged 
                        to Alex Calatrava in the last round and managed to survive, 
                        he might be due for a visit to the proverbial &quot;zone&quot; 
                        against Fabrice. Safin strikes the ball about twice as 
                        hard as Santoro, but Fabrice has two of the best hands 
                        in the game and will play all the angles with his two-handed 
                        sliced forehand. The crowd loves the Tahiti-born scrapper 
                        and he'll give big Marat all he can handle in a four-set 
                        loss.<br>

                        Second seed Marat Safin of Russia continued to struggle 
                        but he survived another scare by slipping past Spain's 
                        Alex Calatrava, 6-3, 3-6, 6-3, 6-7 (4-7), 6-3. Safin also 
                        needed five sets to win his first-round match.<br>
                        Safin, the 2000 U.S Open champion, more than met his match 
                        in the gritty claycourt specialist Calatrava, who ran 
                        the burly Russian ragged throughout the three-hour, 29-minute 
                        ordeal.<br>
                        After the match, the No2 seed, who committed a mammoth 
                        90 unforced errors, admitted that he was thankful for 
                        the workout: &quot;I'm glad I suffered, I fight and won 
                        this match. I'm glad I can fight and win matches, especially 
                        against guys like Alex. He played great today,&quot; said 
                        Safin, adding that his injured back felt a &quot;little 
                        stiff&quot;.<br>
                        &quot;I'm not happy completely with my game. I was playing 
                        perfect tactically for a while there, starting to get 
                        my confidence back. Then I missed a few balls and he started 
                        to pick up,&quot; said the Russian, referring to the point 
                        where he failed to serve out the match at 6-5 in the fourth 
                        set. <br>
                        &quot;So I'm satisfied I win because I was completely 
                        lost there. I was angry enough to break a racket, but 
                        I don't have so many yet, so I have to do something else.&quot; 
                        The moody Safin flung his racket across the court after 
                        losing the fourth set in a tiebreak, receiving a warning 
                        from the chair umpire for his efforts. <br>
                        A quarter finalist here last year, Safin will now meet 
                        Fabrice Santoro for a place in the fourth round: &quot;Fabrice 
                        will be difficult . If I want to win this tournament though, 
                        I have to beat him, it doesn't matter how. I have to beat 
                        him,&quot;Safin said.<br>
                        &quot;Marat and I haven't played each other on clay yet, 
                        but this surface can change a lot of things,&quot;Santoro 
                        said.<br>

                        In the men's draw, No. 2 Marat Safin attempted to kick-start 
                        his season with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-7(6), 6-1 win over Austrian 
                        Markus Hipfl. <br>
                        The 21-year-old Russian has not gotten past the second

                        which are second in importance only to Grand Slams. <br>
                        The reigning U.S. Open champion has been hampered by a 
                        back injury since February, but has continued to play 
                        major tournaments -- by his own admission, to avoid losing 
                        money.<br>
                        &quot;I'm glad that I've recovered from the injury,''

                        Australia overcame the loss of one of its top players 
                        Saturday to defeat Russia, 2-1, in the final of the $2.1 
                        million ATP World Team Championship.<br>
                        Lleyton Hewitt gave Australia the early lead by defeating 
                        U.S. Open champion Marat Safin, 6-3, 6-4.<br>
                        But Australia did not have the services of Patrick Rafter 
                        for the second singles match against Yevgeny Kafelnikov.<br>
                        "Marat is such a tough player to play. It's nice to have 
                        a win over a guy [Marat] who is a contender for the French 
                        Open" Hewitt said."<br>
                        The moody Safin, who soared up the rankings last season 
                        and won the U.S. Open, rattled off three straight errors 
                        in the decisive break. <br>
                        After he netted another backhand, Safin slammed a ball 
                        into the stands in frustration and drew a warning. Earlier 
                        in the week, he broke a racket and accused the referee 
                        of being biased against Russians.<br>
                        This year the 21-year-old has made a series of first and 
                        second round exits at tournaments and has struggled on 
                        clay. <br>
                        Hewitt and Safin could possibly face each other again 
                        in the French Open semifinals.<br>
                        Marat Safin is seeded second at the French Open and will

                        Russia Wins the Red Group <br>
                        On Thursday the Russian squad secured their place in the

                        doubles team of Lucas Arnold and Martin Garcia 2-6, 6-4, 
                        7-5, to secure a 3-0 victory over Argentina.<br>
                        With their victory, Russia won the Red Group over France, 
                        the USA and Argentina, and now awaits an opponent from 
                        the opposing Blue Group.<br>
                        Giving Russia the early advantage over Argentina on Center 
                        Court 2, Safin scored a straight set 7-6(6), 6-4 victory 
                        over Franco Squillari. <br>
                        Extending Russia's lead to 2-0 in the second singles match, 
                        Kafelnikov rallied from being down a set to upend Mariano 
                        Puerta 2-6, 7-5, 6-2.<br>
                        Returning to the court to upend Arnold and Garcia, Kafelnikov 
                        and Safin completed their second sweep of the tournament 
                        after 3-0 victory against the USA on Tuesday.<br>
                        Safin, the world No. 2, has made five exits by the second 
                        round in tournaments this year and struggled on clay. 
                        <br>
                        &quot;I've got my confidence back after the last two difficult

                        Pete Sampras to clinch the tie for Russia.<br>
                        Completing the sweep over the USA, Safin and Kafelnikov 
                        edged out Americans Andy Roddick and Scott Humphries in 
                        two tie-breaks 7-6(3), 7-6(5) in the final doubles match.<br>
                        With the victories, Russia upped its overall record to 
                        3-3, after suffering early defeats to France on Sunday.

                        Marat Safin was embroiled in controversy as he was beaten 
                        7-6 (8-6), 6-3 by Sebastien Grosjean of France at the 
                        World Team Cup. The Russian, who has a reputation for 
                        a short temper after destroying a record number of racquets, 
                        was given a game penalty as Grosjean led 4-3 in the second 
                        set. The trouble started late in the first set as he smashed 
                        his racquet and he later fired a ball out of court and 
                        then banged the chair of American umpire Norm Chryst. 
                        The game penalty left Grosjean serving for the match at 
                        5-3. A fuming Safin suggested afterwards that the umpire 
                        was anti-Russian. "I think we were playing a great match, 
                        great points. Everybody was happy, and he destroyed the 
                        match completely," Safin said. "If he has something against 
                        Russians he can just say it and not umpire us, because 
                        he had a problem last week with Kafelnikov and now against 
                        he made me a penalty game. The guy is crazy. He has no 
                        clue about anything on the court." Chryst, who defaulted 
                        Kafelnikov for swearing at him during a doubles match 
                        last week in Hamburg, received qualified support from 
                        Grosjean. "The umpire has to do something, otherwise it's 
                        tough afterwards for him to control Marat," said the Frenchman. 
                        "Although he hit the umpires chair it was not too hard." 
                        Kafelnikov's wretched clay court season continued when 
                        he was crushed 6-0, 6-3 by Arnaud Clement, giving France 
                        a winning 2-0 lead in the best of three-match tie. In 
                        five clay court tournaments this year, the tortured Russian's 
                        only victory came in Rome when his opponent retired with 
                        an injury. The French then sealed the Russian’s fate with 
                        a convincing win in the doubles rubber. Clement and Grosjean 
                        came from a set down to complete a clean sweep of Kafelnikov 
                        and Safin winning 2-6, 6-4, 6-3.<br>

                        Marat Safin made a special visit to the Airbus plant just 
                        outside of Hamburg on Monday. The plant, which is responsible 
                        for building the new A3XX Airbus airplane to be in use 
                        around 2006, offered plenty of allure for the reigning 
                        US Open champion. <br>
                        The afternoon was highlighted by a ride in the flight 
                        simulator, where Safin proficiently piloted an A-320 plane 
                        through the air and down for landing. <br>
                        He also checked out the assembly line, where the Russian 
                        learned that the A-320 planes are built in just 21 days 
                        at a cost of $40,000,000 each.<br>
                        &quot;Do you have any second hand models that are cheaper?&quot; 
                        asked a wide-eyed Safin. &quot;No,&quot; replied an Airbus 
                        representative. &quot;But I can put you in touch with 
                        some people that can help in that area.&quot; <br>
                        Safin, realizing that buying such a plane was a bit out 
                        of his budget, smiled and thanked her for the offer.<br>

                        Marat Safin's miserable season plumbed new depths on Wednesday 
                        when he was beaten 6-0, 7-6 (7-0) by Gaston Gaudio of 
                        Argentina in the second round of the Hamburg Masters.<br>
                        The world No. 2 and U.S. Open champion is yet to win a 
                        tournament this year and looked a forlorn figure on a 
                        windy court at the Rothenbaum Tennis Centre.<br>
                        Marat Safin, finalist here last year, could barely keep 
                        the ball in play in the first set as world number 40 dominated. 
                        He rallied in the second set, though, finally registering 
                        on the scoreboard but fell apart in the tie-break.<br>
                        The Argentine swept into a 6-0 lead and clinched victory 
                        when Safin double-faulted.<br>

                        In search of his first title of the year, No. 2 seed Marat 
                        Safin posted a 6-2, 6-4 victory over Germany's own Jens 
                        Knippschild.<br>
                        Wrapping up his first round engagement in 1 hour and 8 
                        minutes, Safin, Hamburg's finalist last year, capitalized 
                        on several early Knippschild unforced errors and the German's 
                        inability to convert on key opportunities to race to a 
                        4-1 lead before closing out the first set with a solid 
                        performance.<br>
                        Regrouping in the second set to take the edge off of Safin's 
                        first-set momentum, Knippschild mixed long powerful groundstrokes 
                        with delicate drop shots to match the Russian New Balls 
                        Please campaign star point for point, and stay in contention.<br>
                        At 3-3, Safin finally scored a break of the German's serve, 
                        only to have Knippschild respond with a break of his own. 
                        Despite a valiant effort from Knippschild, Safin aggressively 
                        attacked the net to score his second-straight break of 
                        the German's serve, and held his own to secure the victory.<br>
                        In hope of returning to the form that won the Russian 
                        seven titles last year, Safin, who is finally recovering 
                        from a back injury suffered at Dubai, said afterward: 
                        &quot;It's nice to get my confidence back. I satisfied 
                        with my first round performance.&quot;<br>
                        On Wednesday, Safin will square off against Gaston Gaudio, 
                        who cut short compatriot Mariano Puerta's Hamburg campaign 
                        6-2, 6-3 in their all-Argentine clash.<br>

                        Russia’s US Open champion Marat Safin blasted organisers 
                        of the Wimbledon Championships over their controversial 
                        seeding system, saying the seeding committee of the world's 
                        premier grasscourt tournament knew nothing about tennis.<br>
                        The 21-year-old US Open champion, speaking after his 4-6, 
                        6-4, 7-6 (7-5) defeat at the hands of Switzerland’s Roger 
                        Federer in the second round of the Tennis Masters Series 
                        here, expressed his anger at the system that leaves players 
                        in the dark as to whether they will be seeded or not until 
                        just before the tournament.<br>
                        &quot;It’s just a big mess,&quot; said Safin. &quot;It’s 
                        not nice to do all these things to these players and they 
                        have to do something else. They have to respect us. I 
                        mean we are running 365 days a year, trying to get the 
                        points for Wimbledon to get seeded in Wimbledon and it’s 
                        coming there and you’re not seeded. Well you say ‘why 
                        I am playing tennis?’&quot;<br>
                        The Russian continued: &quot;I mean the people who don’t 
                        know - probably no idea - some of them have no idea about 
                        tennis, they have to decide if I am - if I have to be 
                        seeded or not. I think it’s not correct.&quot;<br>
                        &quot;And I want to say it’s my opinion,&quot; he said. 
                        &quot;And I don’t want to get in any polemics or anything.&quot;<br>
                        But asked if he was going to play Safin said: &quot;I 
                        will play. Play, play. I am seeded I think.&quot;<br>

                        In Wednesday’s action the biggest name to fall was second 
                        seed Marat Safin, who lost 6-4, 4-6, 6-7 to Switzerland's 
                        Roger Federer. The Russian seemed frustrated throughout 
                        the tense affair, which saw him throw his racket to the 
                        floor in the Foro Italico on numerous occasions.<br>
                        Safin, 21, blamed his loss on a lack of practice since 
                        suffering a back injury in March, having only begun to 
                        practice his serve on Friday.<br>
                        The Russian was unable to take advantage of the 64 unforced 
                        errors off the racket of Federer, who compensated with 
                        43 winners. <br>
                        Even if his game may still be a bit rusty, the Russian 
                        star -- who won in three sets in his first round match 
                        -- was in his prime feisty form between points and after 
                        the match. <br>
                        Racket slamming after missed shots, fist-pumping after 
                        winners and no mincing of words in the post-match press 
                        conference.<br>
                        Asked if Federer presented a threat to him in the years 
                        to come, Safin shrugged off the prospect.<br>
                        &quot;With all respect to Roger, we have completely different 
                        results,&quot; he said. &quot;I have more competitions, 
                        more titles, a grand slam. You can't compare us.&quot; 
                        <br>
                        Asked if he has busted any rackets in the two matches 
                        since returning from his injury, Safin smiled. &quot;No, 
                        not yet.&quot;<br>

                        Marat Safin, tossing his racket in his trademark display 
                        of anger, lost 6-3, 6-1 to Arnaud Di Pasquale of France 
                        on Tuesday in the first round of the Masters Series Monte 
                        Carlo. <br>
                        The top-seeded Russian conceded five service games -- 
                        three of them at love -- and was eliminated in 52 minutes. 
                        The one-sided loss raised concerns over Safin's game following 
                        a back injury in March. <br>
                        The 21-year-old U.S. Open champion grimaced with frustration 
                        and hurled his racket several times during a string of 
                        unforced errors, including a double fault that cost him 
                        the next-to-last game.<br>
                        &quot;Today I couldn't do anything,&quot; Safin said. 
                        &quot;I just tried to build a game, but it was a disaster.<br>
                        Di Pasquale, the 2000 Olympic bronze medalist, made his 
                        share of errors in the first set but remained in control 
                        for the crucial points.<br>
                        Safin is No. 1 in the ATP's rolling 52-week ranking system 
                        thanks to last year's performance in which he won seven 
                        titles. But he is No. 20 in the 2001 Champions Race, with 
                        no titles this season.<br>
                        In March, Safin lost the final of the Dubai Open to Juan 
                        Carlos Ferrero after retiring in the second set because 
                        of a back injury. He pulled out of the Davis Cup quarterfinals 
                        against Sweden this month because of the ailment.<br>
                        Safin has lost in the first round in both previous appearances 
                        at Monte Carlo.<br>

                        Top seed Marat Safin was given a tough draw on Friday 
                        as he attempts to kick-start a miserable season at the

                        of the season against wily Frenchman Arnaud di Pasquale. 
                        <br>
                        Safin is struggling with a back injury and has been erratic 
                        all season, failing to recapture the form that saw him 
                        win the U.S. Open last year.<br>
                        Di Pasquale is a danger. He knows how to lift his game

                        Dunlop tennis rackets. Safin will begin playing with the 
                        Dunlop Muscle Weave 200G racket in April. It's not the 
                        first time Dunlop has put its rackets into the hands of 
                        a volatile player. John McEnroe's last wooden racket -- 
                        one he helped design -- was a Dunlop. <br>

                        the Swedes April 6-8th.<br>
                        Safin is carries a rib cage injury into the tie and Kafelnikov

                        it's day-to-day with him. Recently, he even suggested 
                        during a press conference that he won't play for a month. 
                        So, we'll have to wait and see what happens. The other 
                        key thing for us is how quickly Kafelnikov will be able

                        Marat Safin's back hurts, his ribs hurt, and he says the

                        Hampered by injuries, Safin lost his opening match Friday 
                        at the Ericsson Open to Juan Balcells of Spain, 4-6, 6-4, 
                        6-3.<br>

                        well below his norm. He said he felt pressure to play 
                        with his injuries because of ATP Tour rules, including 
                        a ranking and bonus pay system that penalizes players 
                        who withdraw from tournaments.<br>
                        &quot;I'm angry with the ATP,'' Safin said. &quot;They 
                        don't think about me. They don't care what's going on 
                        with me.''<br>
                        If Safin plays in all nine Tennis Masters Series events 
                        this year, including Ericsson, he'll earn a $1.05 million 
                        bonus. If he misses one event, the bonus drops by $700,000. 
                        <br>
                        The Russian said he'll return to Europe for treatment 
                        and isn't sure when he'll play again. With rest, he said, 
                        his injuries could take up to a month to heal. </font>

                        the interaction with nature. &quot;We don't have dolphins

                        errors and hit only 10 winners.<br>
                        &quot;I'm a little disappointed that the injury is this 
                        week, which is Masters Series and is very important to 
                        me,&quot; Safin said. &quot;But all the time you have 
                        to be careful. The problem is that I'm scared a little 
                        bit to get injured again. I have pain, but it's more that 
                        you get scared. <br>
                        &quot;I think it is better to lose here in the first round, 
                        to prepare myself and be 100 percent for Miami [the Ericsson 
                        tournament next week].&quot; <br>
                        Safin hurt his back, apparently a pulled muscle, earlier 
                        this month at Dubai, where searing pain caused him to 
                        quit in the second set against Juan Carlos Ferrero. <br>
                        Asked why he didn't default against Johansson, Safin said: 
                        &quot;You have to try. Why not? I tried and I didn't lose 
                        6-0, 6-0.&quot;<br>

                        Marat Safin, the US Open champion who won an ATP best 
                        seven titles during the year and came so close to clinching 
                        the coveted year-end World No. 1 position, won three awards. 
                        The 21-year-old Russian was voted Most Improved Player 
                        by his fellow professionals, New Balls Please Fans' Choice 
                        and ASAP Sports Most Quotable Player of the Year by the 
                        International Tennis Writers' Association.<br>
                        &quot;It's a great honor for me to receive any award, 
                        but to receive three at once is very special&quot; said

                        Marat Safin appeared to be back on the winning track, 
                        but a minor muscle tear in his back may sideline him for 
                        up to two weeks.<br>
                        The U.S. Open champion, who will be examined by a doctor 
                        today, will most likely miss the Indian Wells next week.<br>
                        &quot;He will probably have to miss the Indian Wells,&quot; 
                        said Russian Tennis Federation president and Davis Cup 
                        captain Shamil Tarpishchev in an interview with Reuters. 
                        &quot;In all likelihood Marat will need up to two weeks 
                        to recover from a minor muscle tear in his back. He is 
                        seeing a doctor on Tuesday and then we can give a better 
                        assessment of the extent of his injury.&quot;<br>
                        The 21-year-old Safin, who had struggled since the start 
                        of the year, was regaining his form last week when he 
                        injured his back in the third set of the Dubai semifinals 
                        against unseeded Swede Thomas Johansson. Safin held on 
                        to win the match, but was forced to retire with the back 
                        injury the next day while trailing Juan Carlos Ferrero 
                        6-2, 3-1 in the final.<br>
