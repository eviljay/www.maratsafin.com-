                  </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">A 
                  tennis racquet is an endangered species in the hands of Marat 
                  Safin. The unofficial ATP leader in destroyed racquets, Safin 
                  has trashed more racquets than Pete Townshend has smashed guitars. 
                  Tossing his racquet in frustration today, Safin didn't shatter 
                  it, but succeeded in cracking his composure to pieces. <br>
<br>
                    A gutsy Guillermo Canas wore down the second-seeded Safin 
                    in scoring a 7-5, 6-3 triumph to advance to the semifinals 
                    of the Tennis Masters Series-Canada. In his first career Tennis 
                    Masters Series semifinal, the unseeded Argentine will take 
                    on either third-seeded German Tommy Haas or unseeded Frenchman 
                    Fabrice Santoro tomorrow to play for a place in the final. 
              <br>
<br>
Seeking his first title of the year, the second-ranked Safin 
                    entered today's quarterfinal coming off a captivating comeback 
                    victory over Chilean Marcelo Rios in which Safin overcame 
                    deficits of 1-3 in the second set and 1-4 in the final set 
                    to earn a hard-fought 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) victory. Meanwhile, 
                    Canas proved himself to be a seed-slayer taking out 10th-seeded 
                    Roger Federer in the first round before beating fifth-seeded 
                    Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov 6-2, 6-2 in yesterday's third-round. 
               <br>
<br>
The 2000 Toronto champion, Safin took the court with a 2-1 
                    career record against Canas with Canas winning their only 
                    prior meeting on hard court with a 6-3, 6-3 victory in the 
                    first round of the 2001 Tennis Masters Series-Cincinnati. 
               <br>
<br>
Surrendering serve at 15 in his first service game, Safin 
                    found himself trailing 0-2, but broke back in the third game 
                    when Canas netted a forehand. Staring repeatedly at his sore 
                    right wrist, Canas reflexively flexed the wrist as if trying 
                    to stretch the soreness from the wrist. Withstanding the racquet-rattling 
                    power of Safin while playing with a sore wrist is about as 
                    easy as arm-wrestling King Kong while wearing handcuffs, yet 
                    Canas countered Safin's advantage in power with his consistency 
                    from the baseline and doggedly determined pursuit of every 
                    shot. As one of the fittest players on Tour, Canas has never 
                    seen a shot he didn't believe he could run down and his extreme 
                    effort took a psychological toll on Safin, who frequently 
                    felt he had won a point only to watch Canas run down the apparent 
                    winner and force him to hit one more shot.<br>
<br>
Consequently, Safin sometimes played more risky shots than 
                    situations required, but was able to overcome his increasingly 
                    faulty forehand with a strong serve in the first set. The 
                    6-foot-4 Safin's superior serve enabled him to win 17 of 20 
                    first-serve points in the first set, but the pesky play of 
                    Canas proved problematic for the towering, temperamental Russian 
                    on his second serve as Canas won 10 of 12 points played on 
                    Safin's second serve. <br>
<br>
Serving to stay in the set at 5-6, Safin hit a forehand wide 
                    to go down double-set point at 15-40. He saved one set point 
                    with a service winner, but at 30-40 Canas followed a forehand 
                    into the net where he dropped down nearly to his knees in 
                    delivering a dazzling drop-volley winner to secure the set, 
                    7-5. The shot apparently served as the antidote to his wrist 
                    ailment as Canas pumped his fist in excitement.<br>
<br>
&quot;The wrist has been very painful this week,&quot; Canas 
                    said. &quot;But I took a pill to kill the pain and now it's 
                    good.&quot; <br>
<br>
He was ingesting pain killers before the match and Canas 
                    proved to be a buzz kill during the match for a surly Safin, 
                    whose mood turned sour following what he felt was a bad call 
                    in the fourth game. The call Ч combined with Safin's frustration 
                    over his own errant shots Ч caused the former US Open champion 
                    to hurl his racquet to the ground in anger.<br>
<br>
&quot;Because of your bad calls, I'm losing the match,&quot; 
                    an angry Safin complained to chair umpire Steve Ullrich during 
                    the changeover after he fell behind 1-4 in the second set. 
               <br>
<br>
A tremendous talent, who appears capable of hitting winners 
                    from nearly any position on the court, Safin's physical prowess 
                    is accompanied by concentration lapses that can make him appear 
                    as focused as a college student enduring a mundane lecture 
                    the day before spring break. <br>
<br>
To his credit, Safin did not give up and held serve at love 
                    to close to within 2-4, but desperately needing a break, Safin 
                    started off the next game by blowing an easy overhead that 
                    he pushed wide while Canas was completely off the court. Despite 
                    donating the free point to Canas, Safin won the next two points 
                    to take a 15-30 lead, but failed to put two successive returns 
                    into the court off mediocre serves as Canas reached game point 
                    and held for 5-2 on a brilliant short-angle forehand pass 
                    crosscourt. <br>
<br>
Like a boxer willing to withstand a barrage of body blows 
                    on the ropes, Canas spent much of the match absorbing Safin's 
                    strongest shots before unleashing quick, concise counters 
                    that stunned his larger foe. Serving for the match at 5-3, 
                    Canas played the point of the match as he careened corner 
                    to corner in running down four successive apparent winners 
                    before pushing a backhand up the line to lead 15-0. The point 
                    was a microcosm of the match: Safin seemingly in complete 
                    command only to watch a determined Canas fight and fight before 
                    turning a totally defensive position into a winner. <br>
<br>
At 15-all, Canas slid a service winner wide to Safin's forehand 
                    to reach 30-15 then served two successive aces down the middle 
                    to vanquish his third seed of the tournament and raise his 
                    record to 41-19 on the season, one win less than Andy Roddick, 
                    who leads the ATP in victories on the season with 42. <br>
<br>
The 12th-seeded Roddick plays another Argentine Ч 15th-seeded 
                    Wimbledon runnerup David Nalbandian Ч in tonight's quarterfinal. 
                    Canas, who could join forces with Nalbandian as teammates 
                    on the Argentine Davis Cup team that takes on host Russia 
                    in September's semifinals, said Nalbandian's Wimbledon run 
                    has inspired his countrymen.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was good for everyone,&quot; Canas said. &quot;He 
                    (Nalbandian) made the Wimbledon final and showed us it is 
                    possible we can do the same someday. I feel very confident 
                    with the way I am playing and I'm very happy to be in the 
                    semifinal.&quot;<br>
