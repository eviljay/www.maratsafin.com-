                  June 2002<br>
                  courtesy Sunday Telegraph <br>
                  <br>
                  At 6ft 4in, he could easily play the Russian villain in a James 
                  Bond movie, <br>
                  says Roy Collins<br>
                  <br>
                  Two years ago, People magazine named Marat Safinj in their list 
                  of 25 most intriguing people in the world and anyone who has 
                  watched his crazier antics on a tennis court would understand 
                  why. As the psychiatrist in Fawlty Towers commented after spending 
                  a few minutes observing Basil: &quot;We've got enough for a 
                  whole convention here.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  But then what would you expect of a man who was forced to play 
                  tennis by his mother at the age of six when he was planning 
                  to be a soccer star?Named after one of the leaders of the French 
                  revolution, Jean-Paul Marat, Safin left no doubt about his Russian 
                  nationality by downing chilled vodka after his US Open triumph 
                  in 2000. He then left to represent his country in the Olympics, 
                  saying: &quot; After that, I want to go to the mountains and 
                  disconnect all mobile phones.&quot;<br>
                  He is, of course, renowned for taking out his poorer shots on 
                  his rackets, estimating himself that more than 150 have so far 
                  ended in courtside bins. It was a skill he began developing 
                  as a teenager, umpire Sergei Gerasimov saying: &quot;By the 
                  time he was 17, he was smashing them right, left and centre. 
                  He'd stomp around the back of the court after a bad shot and 
                  you could hear him chastising himself, saying 'Did you come 
                  here to play or what? Just show me what you can do.'&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin's anger, one must admit, is directed mainly at himself 
                  and he is unrepentant about serial behaviour that has earned 
                  him several fines, saying: &quot;You have to do something to 
                  keep people interested otherwise they will stop coming to watch 
                  tennis.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  If they lost interest in watching Safin, a player of sublime 
                  talent, then it really would be the death knell for the sport. 
                  He is a man who will never play an easy winner when he can try 
                  the impossible, bringing shrieks of delight against Olivier 
                  Rochus in the French Open when he chased a lob to the baseline 
                  and played the ball through his legs to hit the baseline at 
                  the other end.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;His game was always extraordinary,&quot; says Rafael Mensua, 
                  who was his first coach when his family sent him to Valencia 
                  at the age of 14. Mr. And Mrs. Safin might also have been seeking 
                  a little more peace and quiet at their Moscow home.<br>
                  <br>
                  Mensua became coach, friend, mentor and father figure to Safin, 
                  who says: &quot;I'm really proud of him and I would like to 
                  say thanks to him because he was the only one who actually believed 
                  in me. It was a great six years for me.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  At 22, Safin, who is leading the race for the 2002 world No. 
                  1 spot, might already have a cupboard full of Grand Slam trophies. 
                  And he was certainly expected to claim a second in this year's 
                  Australian Open, where he was surprisingly beaten in the final 
                  by Thomas Johansson. Characteristically, he claimed the US Open 
                  2000 with a blistering performance against Pete Sampras in the 
                  final after stinking out Flushing Meadows in the opening rounds. 
                  Sampras, who had won his previous eight Grand Slam Finals, was 
                  beaten in straight sets in a final for the first time.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin might have won more titles since then if it were not for 
                  a continuing back injury that has halted his progress.<br>
                  And when this 6ft 4in hulk feels the badness coming on and clomps 
                  around the court in his red shoes, he looks every inch the Russian 
                  villain from a James Bond movie. But he has the size and the 
                  game to be a serious danger to the more fancied players at Wimbledon.<br>
                  <br>
                  He reached last year's quarter-finals, losing in four sets to 
                  champion Goran Ivanisevic and, though he says he does not believe 
                  he can win a grass-court tournament, it will be surprising if 
                  he does not go along way.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin is not slow to praise himself when he is playing well 
                  but inevitably, he says: &quot;You're never completely satisfied 
                  with your game. You always try to look for a better game, to 
                  serve better, to volley better&quot; To keep his temper better? 
                  &quot;I try to stay calm but it's not always easy.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  His back problems have upset the rhythm of his service action 
                  but when they are coming down from his height on grass, they 
                  can worry the best players. He is concentrating more on winning 
                  tournaments than being world No. 1 he says, believing that the 
                  latter naturally follows the former.<br>
                  <br>
                  He says: &quot; You look at the rankings at the end of the year 
                  because during the year, there are lots of changes. Every time 
                  someone is doing something big, the ranking is changing very 
                  fast. I think you have to check your game first and be careful 
                  with injuries, just try to be focused, try to be stable and 
                  consistent. Then the ranking is going to come with your game.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Whether or not People magazine were right to include Safin on 
                  their list, there is only one word to describe his prospects 
                  of taking on the world's best and the Wimbledon authorities 
                  in the next fortnight. Intriguing.<br>
