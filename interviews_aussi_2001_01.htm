                    Q. Selena Roberts (phonetic), New York Times, just wanted 
                    to ask, did you feel like you had to sort of regroup a little 
                    bit after dropping that set and coming back? </font></p>
                  <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                  <p>MARAT SAFIN: But first of all is very difficult to start, 
                    you know, the tournament, the first match of a Grand Slam 
                    tournament. You expect to win the first match, even playing 
                    bad or playing good. The most important thing is to win. You 
                    know, you start to think that you go to the court already, 
                    you are a little bit scared. It's normal. Everybody is like 
                    this. Especially I knew that I had to play very good against 
                    Galo because he's a very tough player, he beat Patrick Rafter 
                    in the first round of the US Open. He can make some good matches. 
                    It could be me, today, because he was there, he was playing 
                    unbelievable tennis because he played incredible shots like 
                    second set, I thought he was playing this game, he could be 
                    top 20 easy. I didn't expect that he can respond like this. 
                    Actually, I was very lucky. In some important moments I played 
                    very good. Actually, I'm satisfied with my game. But, you 
                    know, you have to -- each time you have to play better and 
                    better if you want to make some good results here.</p>
                  <p>Q. Sandra Harwitt, United States. Do you come into this Grand 
                    Slam feeling any differently knowing that you can win Grand 
                    Slams?</p>
                  <p>MARAT SAFIN: Of course, I starting to get older, you know, 
                    I'm coming to a Grand Slam and I want to win. Because, yeah, 
                    I won one time and I can feel that why -- I have enough game, 
                    I have enough power, enough -- I have everything to win a 
                    Grand Slam tournament. But the problem is if you are lucky 
                    or not because you are in good shape or not because you have 
                    to prepare yourself perfectly for this tournament. You have 
                    to find very fast your game. If you find fast, you can make 
                    some good results. If you don't find it, you have to fight 
                    on the court and run like a dog and try to, you know, wait 
                    for another day, maybe it cannot come. Because not so far, 
                    the difference from playing badly and playing very good. It's 
                    just one match make the difference. So every tournament, especially 
                    in Grand Slam, you will have one or two tough matches that 
                    you have to win. Somehow, just with a lot of luck. If you 
                    win this, you can make some good results.</p>
                  <p>Q. Chuck Narl (phonetic), The Age. Are you physically able 
                    to be at your best? With the elbow, are you physically able 
                    to play at your best.</p>
                  <p>MARAT SAFIN: I mean today, I serve some fast serves. But 
                    you have to understand that this is a Grand Slam tournament 
                    and if you don't give everything, don't come here. If I will 
                    get broken, I quit. It's no doubt. I'm not going to cry on 
                    the court with my elbow or not. I am there, I am going to 
                    serve 100 percent. If I can serve, I will serve. If I can 
                    not serve, I say, &quot;Thank you very much,&quot; and I am 
                    leaving. Because you cannot play with these guys 50, 60, 70 
                    percent. You have to give all your best at the moment. And 
                    with a serve, with a backhand, whatever. And the elbow is 
                    injured. You have to go to the hospital. For the moment, it 
                    is okay. I can serve and I'm really satisfied and I hope it 
                    will serve like this during all the week, two weeks.</p>
                  <p>Q. Barry Wood. How long did it take you to get over just 
                    missing out on the No. 1 at the end of last year?</p>
                  <p>MARAT SAFIN: What do you mean?</p>
                  <p>Q. How long did you take to get over the disappointment?</p>
                  <p>MARAT SAFIN: A long time. I mean, you have to understand 
                    that it's like in every business you want to be the best, 
                    right? This is a kind of business, show business. I wanted 
                    to be the best. I did everything. Probably I was a little 
                    bit lucky on the Masters. I make some probably some stupid 
                    mistakes, and that's why I'm No. 2. So this year I hope I 
                    will be more clever, and I'm going to make all the things 
                    in the right way. So I'm still there; I'm still fighting for 
                    No. 1; and I hope I will fight for a few years more.</p>
                  <p>Q. Charlotte James (phonetic). What would be your biggest 
                    ambition this year: Getting the No. 1 spot back or defending 
                    the US Open?</p>
                  <p>MARAT SAFIN: I don't defend anything this year. I don't want 
                    to think this way. I want to win as much tournaments as I 
                    can. I want to win another Grand Slam title. Of course fighting 
                    for No. 1. It would be great, yeah. I will be there, for sure. 
                    365 days running after the ball, fighting for No. 1. That's 
                    the most important thing, of course. And of course it's win 
                    one or two Grand Slam titles, it could be great.</p>
                  <p>Q. You said in the past that your parents, you know, when 
                    you were growing up you liked football a lot but your parents 
                    kind of pushed you to play tennis. Do you think if you have 
                    kids in the future would you do the same to them?</p>
                  <p>MARAT SAFIN: Kids? (Laughing.)<br>
                    I am 20, still 20. So I don't know what I will do after my 
                    tennis career. You want me to answer what my kids are going 
                    to do. (Laughter.) I don't know what gonna happen tomorrow. 
                    I mean, first of all, I am not ready to have kids yet. So 
                    when I'm gonna be a very old man, very clever man, I hope 
                    so. I will start to think about kids, I will start to think 
                    that first of all, they have to be satisfied. They have to 
                    be happy, more happy than me in my kidness, it will be great 
                    first of all. Then after that, they can decide.</p>
                  <p>Q. Chris Torchia (phonetic) with Associated Press. The ITF 
                    at the moment is testing an oversized ball, one slightly bigger 
                    than the normal size. The idea is to slow down the game a 
                    little bit. What are your thoughts on this oversize ball?</p>
                  <p>MARAT SAFIN: I mean, is not -- they gonna make decision not 
                    because I will say yes, it's good or bad. They gonna make 
                    it anyway, so it's gonna be at least 500 players who are going 
                    to decide if it's correct or if it's not correct. For the 
                    moment, I think the players are satisfied and I don't think 
                    that they have to change something. But anyways, I don't want 
                    to think about this. I mean, my business is on the court. 
                    Out of the court, if they say that the balls are going to 
                    be like, I don't know, like this, we'll have to play with 
                    these balls. I mean, making the show, we are trying to make 
                    it all the best for tennis, all the decisions. We're going 
                    to make it later when it's going to be, you know, something 
                    concrete. Because now is like flying somewhere in the air.</p>
                  <p>Q. Tom Tebbutt. Marat, when you hit your backhand and jump 
                    up on one foot, where did that come from? Why do you like 
                    to hit that shot?</p>
                  <p>MARAT SAFIN: Because it's high balls. It's sometimes you 
                    have to -- because sometimes you win some time. You win a 
                    time there, because the ball is coming, it's like a lob and 
                    the ball bounce and you have to until it's gonna get down 
                    and there's a long wait for the other guy, the opponent. Sometimes 
                    it works, sometimes not. If everybody's trying to do this, 
                    I think it's a good shot. Also, I think the spectators, they 
                    like it.</p>
                  <p>Q. Did you copy Rios or anybody?</p>
                  <p>MARAT SAFIN: No. I don't think so. Because we start to make 
                    it from a long time ago when Rios wasn't born. (Laughter.)</p>
                  <p>Q. Sandy Harwitt. There's a quite a few on the men's and 
                    women's Tour, Russian players that are doing really well. 
                    Is there any reason you can think of for that except for maybe 
                    something in the water back home?</p>
                  <p>MARAT SAFIN: I am glad that there's a lot of players, Russian 
                    players that are now doing well. Each time is more and more 
                    players.<br>
                    It means that, you know, that it's getting popular, this sport, 
                    in Russia. And also the guys, you know, they want to be somebody 
                    in the world and they're trying to give everything for this 
                    business. They want to be someone. That's the most important 
                    thing, they try to show to everybody that, yeah, even the 
                    Russians, they can play tennis. Not only Americans, Australians 
                    or Germans. I think we have a lot of kinds of people, and 
                    just they need time, experience. But I'm really happy is not 
                    only two players from Russia and it's coming some more. It's 
                    great.</p>
                  <p>Q. Marat, Paul Malon (phonetic). I want to ask you whether 
                    you've tried at any stage of your career to change how expressive 
                    you are on court? I'm sure some coaches would say you get 
                    too annoyed on court and perhaps encourage your opponent by 
                    showing your frustration?</p>
                  <p>MARAT SAFIN: Who gonna tell me this? Sorry, but I was No. 
                    1 in the world. Who want to tell me? Yeah, probably but I 
                    don't understand why it's -- everybody is trying to tell me 
                    that it is bad for me. I've been doing this since I was, I 
                    don't know, since a kid. It's my character. How can I change 
                    my character? It's impossible. This is mine, and it's no way 
                    to change it. If you try to change it, I mean, there's no 
                    way. Also, if it's bad or good for me, I think it is okay. 
                    I am doing well. I mean, you saw it last year. Even breaking 
                    50 racquets, I mean I was No. 1 in the world, at least for 
                    two weeks. That means something, no?<br>
