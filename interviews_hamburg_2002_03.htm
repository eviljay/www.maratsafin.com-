                  Tennis Masters Series Hamburg<br>
                  Press conference with MARAT SAFIN<br>
                  <br>
                  Federer vs. Safin 6:1, 6:3, 6:4<br>
                  <br>
                  Question (Q): You played him twice before. What was different 
                  today? You didn’t get started so well. What would you say?<br>
<br>
Safin: I didn’t play very well today as you can see in the 
                    score 6:1, 6:3, 6:4. It was quite easy. I couldn’t bring my 
                    tennis to the court. I was a little bit upset. I just couldn’t, 
                    I didn’t play well.<br>
<br>
Q: In the third set you were coming back.<br>
<br>
Safin: Yes, I was a break up. But still I was looking, I 
                    was fighting. I couldn’t do much playing against him. He played 
                    too good today. I couldn’t do much in the match.<br>
<br>
Q: Your first serve also didn’t go well I guess. That’s a 
                    big disadvantage for your game. <br>
<br>
Safin: Yes, but I couldn’t. I didn’t feel really good on 
                    the court today. My serve didn’t work. He was just calm and 
                    he played the best match of his life. I could feel it, the 
                    serve, the forehand and everything, he was pushing. He was 
                    full of confidence. He was too confident today.<br>
<br>
Q: Is there a special reason why it didn’t work today? Especially 
                    in the warm-up, did you feel bad?<br>
<br>
Safin: No. I think he liked my game. I was missing too much 
                    from the beginning. I was not confident enough. I didn’t start 
                    really well. Too many mistakes, too many unforced errors. 
                    That’s how it was. And then he took advantage of my game. 
              <br>
<br>
Q: When did you notice during the match that you would possibly 
                    lose today? Was there a special moment? I thought in the second 
                    set I noticed resignation in your game?<br>
<br>
Safin: No, the way it started. I could see it was going to 
                    be difficult. And then it was 2: 0 I just understood that’s 
                    it. I was fighting when the break happened in the third set, 
                    it was really tough to play in three sets. I tried to win 
                    in five. I tried, I thought maybe if I win that third set 
                    and if I can make a break in the fourth set that maybe we 
                    could talk about something. But it didn’t work. And when he 
                    made the rebreak in the third set. I knew it was the end of 
                    the story. <br>
<br>
Q: I guess you went into to match with a special tactic? 
                    Could you follow that tactic at all?<br>
<br>
Safin: I said I couldn’t. I tried to play close to the baseline, 
                    I tried to play fast. But I didn’t feel that I had my timing 
                    there. I didn’t feel very good. It was a bit too late all 
                    the time, like 2 seconds. And he was dominating. My game is 
                    to dominate another opponent. It is sad. It is a final of 
                    super nine and I was playing great against Hewitt. Yesterday 
                    I played quite well against Robredo. And I couldn’t play my 
                    game against him. That’s is a pitty. I think I was the favorite, 
                    because I have more experience than him. But I couldn’t do 
                    much today.<br>
<br>
Q: You moved to Spain when you were very young. So you are 
                    used to the heavy red clay. But your biggest success was on 
                    hard court. How would you rate your favorite court? Do you 
                    consider yourself like a hard court player?<br>
<br>
Safin: When I moved to Spain I was 14 and I was 1.60 meter. 
                    I was made on clay. But now I’m 1.95 meter. Now it is difficult 
                    to move on clay for me. Hard court is an easy game. It is 
                    more simple. You serve and do a return. It is quite fast. 
                    Here you have to work and move. For us tall guys it is very 
                    difficult. It is not that I’m lazy. You have to understand 
                    I’m too tall for clay. I can make good results, of course 
                    I can play on clay. But it is more difficult than it is on 
                    hard court.<br>
<br>
Q: You have lost twice in Hamburg. Will you come back and 
                    try again?<br>
<br>
Safin: Yes. Every year, every time, I’ll try. It is a big 
                    tournament. I wish I come here one time and win. It is a good 
                    preparation for the French Open. It is really a difficult 
                    tournament. If you can manage to win this tournament you are 
                    a big player.<br>
<br>
Q: You suggested two years ago that you might have been too 
                    nervous to win against Gustavo. What happened this time. Were 
                    you too nervous or?<br>
<br>
Safin: No, I had no opportunity to be nervous it was so fast. 
                    You need to have time to get to this point. I’m not nervous, 
                    I’m just pissed with myself. I couldn’t do anything. It ridiculous 
                    that I am no. 1 in the world and I couldn’t do much against 
                    Federer. I lost quite easy in 3 sets. That’s the point. It 
                    is sad but it is true.<br>
<br>
Q: Next week you will play World-Team-Cup with Yevgeny Kafelnikov. 
                    Do you help each other too for the French Open?<br>
<br>
Safin: Yes. It is a good tournament for the preparation. 
                    You play one day and have the other day off. It is a good 
                    preparation. You play singles and doubles and have a bit of 
                    fun that’s it basically. It is a tough one. The last two years 
                    we made it to the finals and had a big chance to win it we 
                    were the favorits. Hopefully we can win it this year. We are 
                    looking forward to be the champions this year. <br>
<br>
Q: Do you have a problem that the next tournament will be 
                    without Marc, because he plays the French qualis? Is there 
                    a problem for you?<br>
<br>
Safin: No. First you have to understand that he is not my 
                    coach. He is just trying to bring something in. He wants to 
                    try. But this doesn`t mean that in the future he is going 
                    to be my coach. We’ll see after the French Open. Of course 
                    he has the right to go to the French qualis and maybe play 
                    the main draw of Wimbledon. First of all he has to settle 
                    is tennis career. He has to settle is life. And then we can 
                    talk about business. He has to settle his career first.<br>
<br>
Q: What are you taking away from this week? Losing the final 
                    or becoming no. 1?<br>
<br>
Safin: Both things. It is good to be no. 1 in the race. Of 
                    course it is good a match to think about my tennis what I 
                    need for the future. I think it is experience. Every day you 
                    learn something new. I learned a lot of things today. <br>
