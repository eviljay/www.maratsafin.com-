                  MODERATOR: </b> Questions, please. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>Finally, Grosjean was tougher than Corretja for you.<br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> It was little bit different, because yesterday 
                  I had to fight against all the stadium. Today, at least I had 
                  some people with me, some supporters. It was a different game, 
                  because yesterday was fast. It was fast game. Here, it was long 
                  points, big bounces. It was a question of, you know, fight for 
                  every ball and trying to put him under pressure. Sebastien is 
                  playing very fast, so you have to be pay more attention and 
                  fast balls. And he will have to look, and just be patient. Because 
                  Alex is very fast, and he is playing very lot of top spin. So 
                  the ball is going up, and if you don't hit the ball well, it's 
                  a little bit difficult. But I was patient. I think I make a 
                  good play. And I am satisfied. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Were you nervous, considering the closeness of the 
                  Champions Race?<br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: </b>I think just it's a good experience. I think 
                  I spend three years - three years on ATP Tour, is enough that 
                  I be nervous in these kind of matches. You know, when you fight 
                  for something. In this case, I am fighting for No. 1 with Guga. 
                  Still, I'm making great, great tennis. I think both of us, we 
                  are with lot of confidence and we are playing, I mean, spectacular 
                  game. He played unbelievable well against Patrick. Serve and 
                  volley, he was passing him everywhere. And me, I'm trying to, 
                  you know, be solid on the court, just not to show my emotions 
                  too much, because is not helping me a lot. So I'm trying to 
                  be patient, confidence, be cool on the court, and not get mad 
                  with anybody, not with the ball boys, and all these things. 
                  This is a big chance for me to become No. 1.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>Your biggest crisis out there was facing first the 
                  three set points and then another on your own serve at 4-5. 
                  How did you feel at that point? <br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> I get - I was very, very nervous, and I was 
                  very angry with myself because, you know, you start to play 
                  well. You make a break in the beginning for the set, and serve 
                  didn't work at all. I think it was -- the percentage was very 
                  low. So it's difficult to play like this against Alex. He will 
                  fight for every ball. He will run. He will hit it with the strings, 
                  everything is going to be inside. I couldn't understand what 
                  is happening, because I'm not playing bad. But I was making, 
                  you know, I was going too fast, I think. Then I had imagine 
                  - he had sets points. First of all, he was serving for the set. 
                  He make some stupid mistakes, I mean, he knows it. And also 
                  Love-40, I just played very well. Then I just, I start to - 
                  I said to myself, "You can't play like this because you are 
                  too nervous. You have to be a little bit cool and just play 
                  your game. You don't have to change your game because it's Alex 
                  Corretja." I think I played my game. Then the second set, because 
                  was quite easy. Would be much more easy, but that's life. (smiling)<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>If you ever go to the final with Guga, what do you 
                  think will be your greatest difficulty in playing against him?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>We played already twice this year, twice 
                  in the final, twice 7-6, and a fifth and a third set. In Hamburg, 
                  was 6-5 for me, love-30. I made big mistake to wait for his 
                  mistakes. Tiebreak, 7-6 in the third, also it was - it is a 
                  lottery. You can't do anything there. It's lottery. If you are 
                  lucky, two balls, you win the tiebreak. If you have not lucky, 
                  if you miss one millimeter, you lose the tiebreak. That was, 
                  I think, the big mistake. I didn't push him enough in the first 
                  sets. I didn't push him when I had to push. So I have to change 
                  something. I have to push him since the first ball until the 
                  last ball. No, don't let him to get to his game, because when 
                  he's pushing, he's gonna play unbelievable tennis. But when 
                  you are pushing him, is at least you have a chance. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Next one could be Santoro. What are your thoughts 
                  about that? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Thank you for telling me. (smiling) Thank 
                  you. What do you want to tell me? What do I need to tell you?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> You beat him last time. What did you get from that?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> First they have to play. After, I will see. 
                  But I think is gonna be different game. I beat him at least 
                  once is more than enough for me in my life. I don't need anything 
                  more. I am happiest man in the world. I was happiest man in 
                  Stuttgart, but only for one day. And I think it's - as far as 
                  the crowd, if he wins, the crowd is gonna be with him. He is 
                  last French guy that is in draw. Semifinal. So it's gonna be 
                  tough. But I know really well how to play against him. He knows 
                  really well how to play against me. I think is different game. 
                  It's gonna be different already. Different story. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> When you talk about Guga and your matches with Guga, 
                  you said Hamburg, which is clay court, Indianapolis which is 
                  hardcourt. Here is indoor. Guga has never won an indoor tournament. 
                  Are you surprised he's never won an indoor tournament until 
                  now, and do you think this is the weakest surface for him?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think is not his best surface because 
                  - in Brazil, there is no indoor courts. Very simple. He was 
                  born on clay. He can play on outdoor. Indoor is not normal in 
                  Brazil, I'm sure. But for sure, he gonna win. For sure, he gonna 
                  win indoor tournament because he has enough game, he has a huge 
                  serve, good ground strokes, very fast hands. The thing, I hope 
                  - I hope that that will not be here. Not because I don't like 
                  him. Because you understand we are fighting for No. 1, and it 
                  will be my mistake if I will let him win this tournament. But 
                  I think he gonna win. Definitely, he gonna win few tournament, 
                  because he has everything. But I'll be there to not let him. 
                  At least this year. Next year, if he wants, I will let him win. 
                  (laughing)<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Can you compare the pressure of playing a US Open 
                  final and the pressure of fighting for the No. 1 spot? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> You can't compare final of US Open with 
                  Pete Sampras and, I don't know, final with somebody from No. 
                  1. I felt only one thing, playing final of US Open with Pete 
                  Sampras. I don't know how I'm gonna feel in the final of fighting 
                  for No. 1 here. I don't know. For a moment I am not in the final. 
                  If I am going to be there, you can ask me, and I will tell you 
                  what is the worst thing. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>You seem to take your time to win each point. Before, 
                  you used to end the point very quickly. Is that what you learned 
                  with Andrei Chesnokov?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Not only with Andrei Chesnokov, with Alexander 
                  Volkov. You remember how he played. He never moves at all. He 
                  never bend his knees in his life. It was the easiest person 
                  in the world. But unbelievable talent, and he knew - he knows 
                  very well tennis. He can see from other side, which nobody can 
                  understand this side. But for him, tennis is too simple. I don't 
                  know, for him is not fun. It's too simple. When it's too simple, 
                  it's not interesting. I think it was his big problem when he 
                  was a player. But of course, Andrei, he helps me a lot. But 
                  also, you know, two sides. You know, the side of Andrei Chesnokov 
                  was a big factor. The side of Alexander Volkov was a huge thing. 
                  Both things, you start to learn something. If you don't learn 
                  from these two people then you are...(knocking on wood)... stupid. 
                  (laughter) It would be stupid not to learn anything from these 
                  guys. I mean, both of them, they were greatest players in Russia, 
                  one of the best players in the world. And with all my respects, 
                  I mean, these guys know very well tennis. And even if they didn't 
                  - if Sasha, he never was in the Top 10, but he had the potential. 
                  But he knows very well more than some guys from the Top 10 right 
                  now.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> What special things did you learn from your Spanish 
                  coach (Rafael Mensua)? Actually working with the game now, was 
                  there a lot of wisdom that you maybe got from him?<br>

                  MARAT SAFIN: </b>Just because the question I think - the problem 
                  was at the beginning of the year that I didn't - we didn't understand 
                  each other. We didn't listen each other. I needed somebody at 
                  the time, you know, in the spring, I need someone who can explain 
                  to me the guy with a lot of, you know, well respect, you know, 
                  who knows tennis.So I will need to listen another guy, because 
                  I couldn't - I couldn't realize, I couldn't understand what 
                  the coach wanted to tell me. Then, Andrei Chesnokov came, and 
                  he explain to me in very simple words with, you know, that let 
                  you know that you are a little bit like this (knocking on wood). 
                  "You have to do this, this, this, this." Few things that you 
                  need to do to be good player. I start to do this. I change my 
                  - little bit my confidence changed. My mental head is working 
                  a little bit more. So now is little bit - is much more easier 
                  to work again with my old coach, because we start to understand 
                  each other a little bit better. But even now we fight, but is 
                  okay, because I love him. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> The race for No. 1 is very, very tough. It could be 
                  decided in Masters Cup in Lisbon. Pete Sampras hasn't played 
                  for quite some time. Do you think he has a good chance to become 
                  No. 1?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Pete Sampras?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> What do you think his chances in Lisbon are?<br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> His chances? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> His chances in Lisbon.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN</b>: I think he doesn't need to practice here. 
                  I mean, he doesn't need to play so many tournaments. His tennis 
                  is very simple: Serve, volley, sometimes forehand. That's it. 
                  But for him, it's simple. Doesn't - if he wants, if he propose 
                  to himself that he wants to win something, I think he can do 
                  this. But also, there is another guys like me, like Guga, like 
                  Magnus, like Kafelnikov who also want to win also. So is gonna 
                  be a little bit tough. But I think he has most of the chances 
                  is for Pete. After is coming, Guga, me, Yevgeny. But if he wants 
                  to win, nobody I think will complain. <br>
