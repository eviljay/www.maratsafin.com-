                  Q. Richard Gallet (ph) Australian newspaper. How did you find 
                  your form today on the court? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: It was a difficult match for me because I wasn't 
                  I was a little bit out of the court at the beginning of the 
                  match. So that's why I start to lose -- that's why I lost first 
                  set. I was just little bit -- I didn't know what to do, where 
                  to return, what I had to do. I was a little bit out of -- not 
                  confidence. But I didn't know what exactly I need to do to beat 
                  him. I was a little bit confused and also the guy, I mean the 
                  guy he played unbelievable tennis. He make not many mistakes 
                  the first two and a half sets. He was playing great tennis. 
                  And I was just trying to do something. And finally I found my 
                  game in the second and third set. In the fourth set, I was just 
                  a break up, then the guy, he called physio and took him three 
                  minutes to do something, I don't know, with the feet. So I was 
                  little bit -- I lost my concentration. And that's why I was 
                  in trouble in the fourth set. But I was lucky, and then in the 
                  tiebreak, I made some good shots and I won. I'm happy. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Do you think you have a pretty easy run going up in the next 
                  couple matches? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I don't know who I have to play. I don't know who's 
                  next. Tabara. It's already, they are kind of matches they are 
                  not easy opponents. If he pass two rounds, that means he's in 
                  good form and he can play some tennis. But we'll see, I mean... 
                  I know that he was a great junior. He was finalist of European 
                  Championships. I am just one year older -- one year younger. 
                  I know his style, he can play good tennis. But we'll see. It's 
                  not gonna be easy, definitely. If I will start the way I started 
                  today, I will be in big trouble. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Are you having any trouble with the injury you had last week 
                  at Kooyong? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: It wasn't injury. I was afraid that it can be worser. 
                  When you start to feel something in the elbow, especially in 
                  my elbow because I -- once I had big problem, it was one year 
                  and a half ago in Roland Garros. So it was quite the same pain. 
                  I had to stop and I didn't serve for four or five days. But 
                  now here, I have to play with 100 percent. And if I get if I 
                  will break my elbow, my capsule, so it's bad luck. But I mean 
                  these kind of matches you cannot play with second serve definitely. 
                  I am going for full power and just try to take some rest and 
                  days off to work with the physio, you know, make some ultrasound 
                  and all these things. And for the moment is okay. I'm satisfied. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. For sure the capsule is not broken? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: No, otherwise -- I don't know, if the capsule is 
                  broken, you cannot stretch the -- it's very simple. You cannot 
                  stretch like this. You cannot go like this. The only move you 
                  can make is this. I had this -- but was -- the capsule is very 
                  dangerous. If you ask players that had problems with the capsule, 
                  it's very dangerous because you cannot play for one month, one 
                  month and a half, two months. And if it's second or third time 
                  you break the capsule, you can make operation. If you make operation, 
                  it will take from four months to six months. So you decide what 
                  you want. <br>
