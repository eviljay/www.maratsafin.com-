                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> It was a very tight match, very close finish, but 
                  you came through it. We're all wondering now if you feel that 
                  you're No. 1, even though the ATP Tour is still sort of sticking 
                  to the race and not counting the entry system?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think, I mean, at the end of the year, 
                  it's coming. It's not the beginning of the year where you're 
                  just starting, you're No. 1. After the first week of the year, 
                  I think it's the end of the year. I just show it to everybody 
                  that I can win good tournaments. I'm not lucky, nobody is - 
                  has been injured. Nobody has any problems. Everybody played 
                  this year. So I think I - why I have not to think? Why I cannot 
                  think that I am No. 1? I think I'm playing great tennis, and 
                  I won enough tournaments to show it on all the surface - not 
                  on grass, but I'm looking forward. I think I am just - at this 
                  moment I am No. 1. Sorry, but maybe somebody don't like it, 
                  but that's life.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>Going to the hospital, will you need stitches in the 
                  wound, do you think? Have you been told? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think I have to make - I don't know, points. 
                  Stitches. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Stitches. You have to have stitches? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah. I have to, because I open my - I hit 
                  it with the frame of the racquet. So I have to take care of 
                  myself also. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>It seems you were knocked down on the court. Can you 
                  explain how? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> How it happened and what happened after? 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Yeah.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> All the story? (laughter) Just it was I 
                  tried to make - I don't know - to hit the ball. Everybody saw 
                  it. I don't know how, but I hit it with the frame. In the first 
                  seconds, you start to understand because it's - it hurts a lot. 
                  You get hit, and you just don't want to see your arms, because 
                  you know that you're bleeding for sure. You can feel it. Then 
                  you get - just you don't understand what is happening. When 
                  you see the blood, you get scared. That's it. After, I just 
                  - you have to think. I start to think too much about my - what 
                  is happening with my - how you say the name? What is this? (pointing 
                  to eyebrow) <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>THE MODERATOR</b>: The injury. <br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> Not the injury. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Eyebrow. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah. You start to think what I have to 
                  do. Because if it gets open and I have to finish the match, 
                  I have to quit, because it's not possible to get any more help 
                  from Alex. So I have to say, "Thank you," and, "Bye-bye." That's, 
                  you know, after two sets, winning two sets, you just don't want 
                  to give it away.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> It seems that you started the first set a little bit 
                  slow today, then you enter the match in the tiebreak of the 
                  second. How come? Were you tired? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>No, I think I had probably too much respect. 
                  I was maybe not warm enough. I was thinking too much, because 
                  I saw him, I saw his matches, and he impressed me very much. 
                  But after the match, we start to forget about all these things 
                  and we start to play the game more or less. It was going better 
                  and better each time. But also, I'm not satisfied with my return, 
                  because if you play against these guys and you don't return, 
                  there's no chance to beat them. But today, I was lucky. But 
                  next day, it won't be like this, because it was in tiebreak. 
                  And tiebreak, as you know, it is a lottery. You never know what 
                  is gonna happen. These guys, you have to put them under pressure. 
                  They have to be under pressure all the time on their serves. 
                  So it's - I have to improve this thing.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> How close was it to a retirement today? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> It was quite - very close. Because I asked 
                  Alex, and he said if it's - we were out of three minutes. It's 
                  only three minutes. If it starts bleeding, he can count to put 
                  something - some glue. But if it starts bleeding, I have to 
                  stop the match, because it's already is not fair for the opponent 
                  because he has to wait all the time. You know? It's not the 
                  point. The guy is running like a dog, and he's fighting. Because 
                  of other guy is bleeding, you have to wait all the time. I think 
                  is not correct. I was very close.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Your victory in the US Open is regarded as your best 
                  performance ever. How close to that one was this one? <br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> Very. It's different. Different game. Because 
                  I didn't have to lose anything. When I came to the US Open, 
                  I was 9 in the world. Here, I am No. 2, and everybody is looking 
                  at you, and they can - you're No. 1 next week. So everybody 
                  is expecting that you gonna win. Mark played great tennis. I 
                  was very close to lose it. And just I think quite confidence 
                  that the people are satisfied with my game. I think I deserved 
                  it, to be No. 1 next week. And also thanks to all the people 
                  who came today. I think they helped me a lot. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q</b>. Do you think the injury helped you a little bit, because 
                  you broke him for the first time right after that. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No. But maybe with that point, yes. But 
                  during all other three sets, he thinks too much. You know, a 
                  lot of energy is going out because you are not concentrated 
                  on the match. You are thinking about what is happening with 
                  your head, and how if it is bleeding or not. It's a situation 
                  you do not know. You know that after the match you have to go 
                  to the hospital; they have to put some... whatever. <br>
                  <b><br>
                  THE MODERATOR:</b> Stitches.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Stitches. And you get scared. Of course, 
                  you can see the doctor putting the stitches. You get afraid. 
                  I'm a human being, so it's a little bit - I know the match, 
                  since that time I start to think about this. And I don't like 
                  this situation. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q</b>. And in the last tiebreak, what made the difference? 
                  <br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> What made the difference? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>Experience or...? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Not experience. Experience, if you have 
                  enough experience, you don't miss - I don't lose five matchpoints 
                  like you going first time to the school. So easy balls. I mean 
                  I was just lucky. I was lucky that he missed the last - his 
                  forehand was quite easy. Thanks to him, I won this match. But 
                  not to me, I was just trying to do all my best. But I had my 
                  opportunities. I didn't, you know, do anything special. I miss 
                  many easy balls. So... Thanks to him to help me. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>Do you think that the racquet took a revenge against

                  matches, I run a lot. It's a lot of energy you're spending on 
                  the matches. After the match, because you're still in the match, 
                  playing the match. And I need to rest because I don't want, 
                  you know, I'm playing okay, and I have to be calm and to be 
                  prepared in Lisbon. That's the week that you have to be 100 
                  percent. <br>
