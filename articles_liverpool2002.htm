                  By David Randles, icLiverpool<br>
                  courtesy <a href="http://icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk/" target="_blank">icliverpool.icnetwork.co.uk</a><br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Marat Safin fulfilled his potential as favourite to beat Jan-Michael 
                  Gambill in the final of the inaugural Liverpool International 
                  Tennis Tournament.<br>
                  <br>
                  The towering Russian (right) continued the form he had shown 
                  all week to beat his American counterpart 7-6, 6-7, 6-4 in Calderstones 
                  Park on Saturday.<br>
                  <br>
                  Despite both of the first two sets going to tie-breaks without 
                  one dropped service, Safin always looked in control in what 
                  was a fine display of tennis by both players.<br>
                  <br>
                  And it was Safin who stole the only break of the match in the 
                  seventh game of the third and final set from which he went on 
                  to win the tie.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin found the exhibition showpiece event an ideal pre-cursor 
                  to Wimbledon where he faces 1997 runner-up, Cedric Pioline in 
                  the first round: &quot;This tournament has given me more experience 
                  to know how to play on grass,&quot; he said.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Everybody can play on grass nowadays and of course everyone 
                  will be motivated for Wimbledon next week.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  But despite a quarter-final place last year and being ranked 
                  as No2 behind Australia's Lleyton Hewitt to take the Mens Singles 
                  Title at the All England Club in the next fortnight, Safin played 
                  down his chances of success: &quot;I would not have a bet on 
                  myself,&quot; he said.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I do know how to play on grass but it is not my favourite.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  A US Open Champion just two years ago, Safin was called into 
                  the pioneering Liverpool tournament following the late withdrawal 
                  of last year's Wimbledon Champion, Goran Ivanisevic through 
                  injury.<br>
                  <br>
                  After thanking the people of Merseyside for their support throughout 
                  the week, the amiable Russian said: &quot;I've enjoyed my stay 
                  in Liverpool. The people are very friendly and it's been very 
                  relaxed.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Of course I've had the chance to take in the city of the 
                  Beatles and its fantastic nightlife.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I will certainly recommend to other players to come here 
                  in the future and hopefully every year will get better and better.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  At times throughout the tie, Safin was undone by the bounce 
                  of the ball, after 35 matches in one week had taken its toll 
                  on the main court. But when asked about the conditions, the 
                  Champion was again complimentary: &quot;The ground staff have 
                  worked hard at short notice to prepare the playing surface and 
                  with experience things will only improve each year.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Defeated finalist, Gambill echoed Safin's sentiments about the 
                  success of the tournament and also thanked local people for 
                  their support: &quot;I would like to thank everyone who has 
                  turned up to support this event,&quot; he said.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;There aren't many warm-up tournaments like this anymore 
                  and the fact that Liverpool will be hosting this event each 
                  year is a big plus for the sport and very important to us players.<br>
                  <br>
                  The event, which ran from 16-22 June, has been hailed as a success 
                  despite relatively low attendance figures.<br>
                  <br>
                  In a week which saw England's World Cup quarter-final clash 
                  with Brazil, plus the Liverpool River Festival, the competition 
                  was up against stiff opposition, but organisers plan to make 
                  it an annual fixture on the pre-Wimbledon calendar.<br>
