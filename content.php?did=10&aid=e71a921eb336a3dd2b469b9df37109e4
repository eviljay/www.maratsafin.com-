<TD class=content colSpan=2><SPAN class=headline>Safin meets his destiny as he brings the Cup home</SPAN></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD class=content colSpan=2>It was the same, but different. <A href="http://www.daviscup.com/teams/player.asp?player=10014534"><U><FONT color=#810081>Marat Safin</FONT></U></A> had been here before, having helped <A href="http://www.daviscup.com/teams/team.asp?team=RUS"><U>Russia</U></A> to lift the Davis Cup in 2002 by playing three matches in three days. But this time, he had won the third point in a decisive fifth rubber, and done so in his hometown in front of his adoring public. It doesn’t get much better for any player.<BR><BR>Safin defeated <A href="http://www.daviscup.com/teams/player.asp?player=10025788"><U>Jose Acasuso</U></A> 63 36 63 76(5) to hand Russia the Davis Cup by BNP Paribas for the second time, denying <A href="http://www.daviscup.com/teams/team.asp?team=ARG"><U>Argentina</U></A> the chance to become just the 13th different nation to raise the priceless trophy. This triumph in Moscow permanently banishes the memory of painful losses in the Davis Cup Finals held in this city in 1994 and 1995. Russia is a vastly different country to what it was then, and this is a completely different team, one representative of the new Russian order. With its strength in depth, other nations should be warned: it has the potential to dominate the world’s biggest team competition for many years to come.<BR><BR>
<H5>Safin chosen over Tursunov</H5><BR>“This one is the most valuable one,” said an elated Safin about this Davis Cup title. He admitted that his captain Shamil Tarpischev had had to choose between fielding him or Dmitry Tursunov in the decisive singles, but in the end went for him.<BR><BR>If the 2002 victory hinged on Mikhail Youzhny, who was on the team this weekend but ultimately played no part, this 2006 triumph was all about Marat Safin, the lowest-ranked but most iconic of the hosts’ line-up, who said he was prepared to play all three days and recovered from a disastrous start in this final to redeem himself – and his below average season – in spectacular fashion.<BR><BR>“I would say I had a rather good finish of the year,” said Safin in typical laconic fashion. “It motivates you well to stay in tennis and to continue your career. The victory in the Davis Cup is about one of the best events in one's career.”<BR><BR>
<H5>Acasuso contributed to quality match</H5><BR>The fifth rubber of the 2006 Davis Cup Final was a high-quality affair, and Jose Acasuso played no small part in that. He was thrown into the fray at the 11th hour, David Nalbandian having forced the decider with a four-set win over Nikolay Davydenko in Sunday’s first singles match. <BR><BR>Acasuso, Argentina’s No. 2 player and the world No. 27, is just one ranking spot lower than Safin, and led the Russia 2-1 in previous encounters. But the two-time Grand Slam champion’s greater experience in big matches both in and out of Davis Cup was crucial to a win that left the Argentine shattered and in tears at the side of the court.<BR><BR>“We both tried to play our best game because otherwise we had no chance,” said Safin. “I had no chance to beat Chucho Acasuso because he was playing great tennis, serving well and pretty solid from the baseline. It was a big tournament for him, a big final, and unfortunately lack of experience was the key here in important moments.”<BR><BR>
<H5>Acasuso: “I’m sad”</H5><BR>“I'm sad for having lost,” said a devastated Acasuso. “I'm sad because I gave it a hundred percent. I showed a great level of game. It didn't work for us. On the one hand I feel sad because we did everything, we were so close to it. On the other hand, I'm happy with the way I played today.”<BR><BR>This was the 20th time that a Davis Cup Final has gone to the decisive fifth rubber, and the fourth time in the last six years. With the weight of history perhaps pressing heavier on Acasuso’s shoulders, the Argentine got off to a disastrous start. Safin meanwhile couldn’t miss, his powerful serving confirming the turnaround that had begun with Saturday’s doubles victory, after his dismal loss to Nalbandian on Friday.<BR><BR>
<H5>Opening set to Safin</H5><BR>One break of Acasuso’s serve in the second game of the match was enough to give Safin the opening set in 30 minutes. The Argentine looked out of his depth in what was just his third live Davis Cup rubber, having only made his debut in the competition at the beginning of 2006.<BR><BR>But the Argentine was getting more comfortable with his surroundings, and began to work his way into the match at the end of the first set. He started to pressurise the Safin serve more in the second, and having survived two break points when leading 3-2, used that momentum to get a break himself in the next game, sealing it with a stunning crosscourt forehand winner.<BR><BR>This match, by far the best of the Final, was all about winners created from angles and hit deep into the corners, about solid serving and subtle changes of pace. It was also all about the crowd – every seat in the 11,500-seater arena was full, with the majority 10,000 Russian spectators putting all their heart into drowning out the vociferous travelling band of 1,000 Argentines.<BR><BR>
<H5>Second set Acasuso</H5><BR>Acasuso’s break secured him the second set, and the final was all square again. But Safin broke in the second game of the third set, and Acasuso lost his focus, using a medical timeout for treatment to his right ankle after the fifth game as a chance to regroup. <BR><BR>It seemed to do the trick – he held in spectacular fashion and then broke back for a 4-3 lead, but the South Americans’ joy was short-lived, as Safin immediately went up another break. A service hold for the Russian handed him a two-sets-to-one lead, and the Davis Cup title was within reach.<BR><BR>
<H5>Tense tiebreak</H5><BR>With the tension and the quality of the tennis cranked up still higher in the fourth set, both men were untouchable on their serve in the decider, forcing the first tiebreak of the weekend at the most crucial moment. Safin got ahead first, his 16th and final ace of the match helping to opening up a 4-2 lead, and then he had two match points at 6-4. Acasuso valiantly saved the first, but destiny was on Safin’s side, and he closed out his momentous victory with yet another unreturnable serve.<BR><BR>
<H5>Triumph for Russia; disaster for Argentina</H5><BR>The Russian stumbled, dazed, into the arms of his teammates as they invaded the court and hoisted him onto their shoulders in what is now a Russian tradition. Triumph on one side of the net was balanced by disaster on the other as Acasuso sat with his head in his hands on the Argentine bench, inconsolable.<BR><BR>Argentina’s captain, Alberto Mancini, admitted that the doubles rubber on Saturday had probably been pivotal to the outcome of the final, and that the visitors had been surprised at how easily they’d lost that match. But after watching his team come so close to lifting the Davis Cup trophy, he said, “I'm proud of every member of the team. They did everything they could. They left everything inside the court. They really played very good during the weekend.”<BR><BR>Said Russian captain Tarpischev, “There is part of the truth to what he [Mancini] says because the doubles was a key to the tie in many senses. You also have to look at the whole series of five rubbers. You have to look at the work load.”<BR><BR>
<H5>Tarpischev right again</H5><BR>When asked why he finally chose Safin over Tursunov to play the crucial rubber, Tarpischev responded: “What spoke in favour of Marat was the expertise he had in such matches. He went through all the trials and tribulations in his career. He had more expertise. It was clear to me that he could be playing a bit worse or a bit better, but he can't just fail in such kind of match.”<BR><BR>As has so often been the case as this wise captain has steered his charges to the Davis Cup title this year, Tarpischev was proved right in Moscow this weekend.<BR></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P>

<P><SPAN class=headline><STRONG>Russia takes lead with magnificent doubles victory<BR></STRONG></SPAN></P></TD></TR>
<TR>
<TD class=content colSpan=2>The hosts have re-established their lead in the final of the Davis Cup by BNP Paribas after sweeping to a 62 63 64 victory in the doubles at the Olympic Stadium in Moscow.<BR><BR>New Davis Cup partnership Marat Safin and&nbsp;Dmitry Tursunov&nbsp;needed just one hour, 38 minutes to destroy the game and morale of&nbsp;Augustin Calleri&nbsp;and David Nalbandian. The victory handed Safin revenge for his heavy singles defeat to Nalbandian on Friday but it was Tursunov who provided the inspiration, playing superb tennis. <BR><BR>
<H5>Reversal of fortunes for Safin and Nalbandian </H5><BR>What a reversal of fortunes after the second singles on Friday. Then, Safin slumped while Nalbandian rose to the occasion; today, the Russian bounced back triumphantly while the world No. 8 was unable to find his game, starting badly and spiralling miserably downwards. <BR><BR>Safin and Nalbandian are two of the most unpredictable men on tour, but still this was an unexpected turnaround. For Russia, this was yet another tactical move by captain Shamil Tarpischev that paid off, the wily head of Russian tennis replacing Mikhail Youzhny with Safin. <BR><BR>A few eyebrows were raised at the Safin-Tursunov combination, the duo having only played together four times previously and with limited success, but the partnership of this two tall, powerful men worked, and in probably the way most would predict if both were playing their ‘A’ game: by pounding the Argentines with unreturnable serves and pinpoint-accurate groundstrokes off both sides.<BR><BR>
<H5>Nalbandian: “I didn’t serve very good”</H5><BR>When asked what had gone wrong for Argentina on Saturday, Nalbandian said, “I think not many things, but one thing comes to another. In the beginning, we couldn't make any return. We didn't play many points when they served. Maybe they got out a little of confidence on the match. Then I didn't serve very good in the beginning, so it was tough.” <BR><BR>The loss was Nalbandian and Calleri’s first as a team after two successful outings this year. Calleri, the world No. 29, was the stronger player but he found no support in his partner, the team’s talisman. It was as if Nalbandian was emotionally drained after his momentous straight-sets win over Safin and the wild celebrations that followed it.<BR><BR>“Today he [Nalbandian] just didn't motivate himself enough,” said Safin. “I think he had know emotion left, didn't take his chances. He didn't return well. He made some easy errors from the baseline. He helped us a lot to win.”<BR><BR>
<H5>Safin wants to play all three days</H5><BR>If the Russian duo were surprised by how easily they won, they didn’t show it, and neither did they celebrate too wildly when they won. Safin and Tursunov stayed focussed all match – you sensed this was a job they had to get done, and it isn’t finished yet. <BR><BR>Safin said after Saturday’s doubles win that he’d known on Friday that he would be playing today. “We decided who would be playing as my partner. We crossed out Davydenko because he has to play on the third day. We also crossed out the candidacy of Youzhny because Youzhny still has some problems with his leg, it hurts. We didn't know whether Youzhny could withstand a five setter. Dima was left. We played together a couple times before. We didn't expect to win, but we tried to catch our luck. It worked. We did catch our luck.”<BR><BR>How much of what Safin said was to throw the visitors off the scent regarding any potential changes to the Russian singles line-up for Sunday, and how much is true, remains to be seen. The two-time Grand Slam champion also said that he had declared his desire to play all three days. “There is no problem for me to play all three matches. I would not accept the answer 'no' to me.” <BR><BR>
<H5>Potential team changes for both Russia and Argentina</H5><BR>In his bid to secure a Russian victory in the first reverse singles tomorrow, Tarpischev could substitute either Davydenko or Safin in favour of Tursunov, on the strength of his magnificent form today and his performances this year in decisive singles matches. <BR><BR>As for Argentina, captain Alberto Mancini simply said, “We have to think for our team and decide the best option and then whatever happens.” The most likely scenario is that he will take Juan Ignacio Chela out after his loss to Davydenko on Friday, and replace him with Jose Acasuso, who has sat on the bench so far.<BR><BR>“Obviously we're 2 1 down. We need to come back tomorrow,” said Mancini. “But I think we have - we still have good chances. Two tough matches, but we still feel we have a chance.”<BR><BR>
<H5>Tursunov domination</H5><BR>It was fitting that Tursunov served in the first and last games of an encounter he dominated so much; the California-based 23-year-old lost just four points all match on his serve. The Russians broke Nalbandian in the fourth and eighth games of the opening set to clinch it 6-2.<BR><BR>With the match rapidly running away from them, Nalbandian disastrously lost his serve for the third time in three service games to give Russia a cushion in the second set. As Safin and Tursunov continued to dictate the rallies, which barely lasted more than a stroke or two, Nalbandian’s error count grew. When the world No. 8 finally held his service game for 5-3, it was met with a muted response from the Argentine fans who sensed the writing was on the wall.<BR><BR>The visitors put up slightly more resistance in the final set, but one break of Calleri’s serve in the second game was all it took to put Russia 2-1 up after the second day. The Argentine fans, who had started the match in such fine voice, left subdued, but the local crowd had been noticeably louder today than on Friday, something that surely contributed to the home pair’s emphatic victory.<BR><BR>Tursunov was characteristically modest about his contribution. “Indeed we served well. I don't know, you can say whatever you want about the match, but I think the fact we served well helped a lot. What also helped is that we communicated with each other often… We decided from the very beginning it would be not inventing the wheel, it would be just playing our own tennis, the tennis we are used to.”<BR><BR>
<H5>Maradona congratulates Russians</H5>
<P><BR>One Argentine who managed to put his country’s crushing defeat behind him was Diego Maradona, 1.6 metres tall and on hand afterwards hug Safin (1.93 metres) and Tursunov and (1.85 metres).</P>

<P><STRONG>November 28th 2006</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>From Russia with love of great finals <BR><BR></STRONG>The phrase “eagerly awaited” is perhaps overused in sport, but when Russia’s and Argentina’s players take to Moscow’s Olympic Stadium for the final of the 2006 Davis Cup by BNP Paribas on Friday 1 December, there will be a buzz of anticipation stretching from Vladivostock to the southernmost tip of the Americas.<BR><BR>Though noone can predict how a match will pan out, there are a dozen omens to suggest that Russia’s presence in the Davis Cup Final is almost a guarantee of drama. This is Russia’s fourth final – competing both as a self-standing country and in the 31 years it played as the Soviet Union – and all three others have had more than their fair share of stories to tell the grandchildren.<BR><BR>In 1994, the team fashioned by the emergence of Yevgeny Kafelnikov, a charismatic if shy blond from the Black Sea, made it to Russia’s first final against the mighty Swedes, who visited the Olympic Stadium going for their fifth title. It was very much Kafelnikov, the 20-year-old standard bearer of Russian tennis, against Edberg, the 28-year-old godfather of the Swedish team. Yet by the time the two men were due to play each other, the tie was decided, with Russia having become the first – and still only – team in Davis Cup history to have lost the first three rubbers of a final in five sets.<BR><BR>While Edberg was expected to beat Alexander Volkov in the opening singles, in retrospect Russia’s chances disappeared when Volkov lost a classic Davis Cup five-setter. The ungainly left-hander – originally right-handed but he learned to play with his left after injuring his right playing ice hockey – fought back from two sets down to earn a match point on the Edberg serve at 5-4 in the decider. Edberg saved it, but Volkov held his nerve to lead 6-5. Edberg levelled at 6-6.<BR><BR>As Volkov prepared to serve in the 13th game, there was a commotion right behind one of the baselines, as President Boris Yeltsin, an immensely popular figure having put down the attempted “old guard” coup three years earlier, took his seat flanked by several burly security guards. It was awful timing, and surely not of Yeltsin’s making – he is such a tennis fan it is hard to see him not waiting for the change of ends. The disruption caused by his entrance caused Volkov to waver, Edberg pounced, and served out an 8-6 final set.<BR><BR>In those few moments between Volkov’s match point and Edberg winning, the whole weekend turned around. Kafelnikov was expected to beat Magnus Larsson in the second singles, but the 20-year-old froze, and Larsson won 12 of the first 14 games. Kafelnikov finally got going in the third, but undid all his good work in the fifth, as Larsson ran out the winner. Still the Russians didn’t give up, Kafelnikov and Andrei Olhovskiy taking the year’s best pair, Jan Apell and Jonas Bjorkman, to five sets, but losing 8-6 in the decider.<BR><BR>Ten months later, Russia was back in the Olympic Stadium with a home semifinal against an optimum German team boasting Boris Becker and Michael Stich. While Russia welcomed back Andrei Chesnokov, who had fallen out with the 1994 captain Vadim Borisov, the Germans were thought to be too strong, especially after taking a 2-0 lead after the opening singles.<BR><BR>What is not in doubt is that the clay court was over-watered, making it very soft and desperately slow. Russia said it was an accident, Germany suspected skulduggery to reduce the effectiveness of Becker’s big-hitting game. Either way, Becker and Stich lost the doubles in five sets, Becker picking up an injury that would rule him out of the reverse singles. Kafelnikov duly dispatched Bernd Karbacher, and in the finest moment of his career, Chesnokov saved nine match points before beating Stich 14-12 to send Russia through to a second successive home final.<BR><BR>Again the “Olimpiinsky” staged it; again it provided drama. In the opening singles, Pete Sampras beat Chesnokov in five sets, and needed to be carried off court in a state of near-exhaustion. Yet he bounced back to partner Todd Martin in a straight sets doubles win over Kafelnikov and Olhovskiy, before beating Kafelnikov to crown the greatest Davis Cup weekend of his life. Some people say Sampras’ lukewarm feeling about the Davis Cup began the next day, when he returned to America expecting to be feted as a hero, but finding only muted appreciation. His exploits are certainly recognised in the Davis Cup community.<BR><BR>It took until 2002 for Russia to reach another final, with Kafelnikov nearing the end of his career. Russia’s visit to the Bercy arena in Paris was thought to be Kafelnikov’s last chance of glory, and when he and Marat Safin lost a glorious five-set doubles to Fabrice Santoro and Nicolas Escude, his chance seemed to have gone. But Safin then delivered one of the best Davis Cup performances of his career to beat Sebastien Grosjean, and then Mikhail Youzhny, standing in for the injured Kafelnikov, fought back from two abject sets against Paul-Henri Mathieu to become the first man ever to win a live fifth rubber of the Davis Cup Final from two sets down.<BR><BR>It wasn’t quite Kafelnikov’s last tie – he played twice in 2003 – but it was effectively the climactic end to his Davis Cup by BNP Paribas career. He will be at the Olympic Stadium for this year’s final, a more corpulent figure than in his prime. These days he spends his professional time playing high-level poker, interspersed with stints as a television pundit.<BR><BR>The last time Russia hosted Argentina was in the 2002 semifinals, not at the Olympic Stadium but at the Luzhniki Sport Palace, another venue from the 1980 Olympics. It was memorable for a gripping doubles, in which David Nalbandian made his Davis Cup debut partnering Lucas Arnold in the doubles. They beat Kafelnikov and Safin<BR>19-17 in the fifth set, having saved two match points on the Safin serve at 17-16, posting the longest Davis Cup match since the tiebreak was introduced in 1989: six hours 20 minutes.<BR><BR>Nalbandian lost the following day’s singles to Safin as Russia went through to the final, but if Nalbandian is on form this time, there should be more pages to be written in the dramatic annals of Russia’s Davis Cup history.<BR></P>

The streets of this historic capital are free of snow, and the hosts will be hoping that isn’t the only thing that’s different from when they contested their two previous Davis Cup finals here in 1994 and 1995. <BR><BR><BR>Russia bids for home triumph<BR><BR>With freezing conditions outside, Russia fell inside this same stadium, to Sweden in 1994, and the United States in 1995. Since then of course the nation has won the Davis Cup by BNP Paribas, doing so in spectacular fashion against France in Paris in 2002. But triumphing at home is the goal that drives the team this week, and the chance to prove themselves in front of more than 10,000 home fans and dignitaries in Russian tennis’s spiritual home.<BR><BR>Playing Argentina in what should be a fascinating Davis Cup final, the question that will be answered over the next few days is which team’s desire is the greater: that of the Russians to win at home, or the Argentineans to win their first Davis Cup title in history.<BR><BR>It is the Argentineans’ first visit to the final for 25 years, and for most of them their first trip to Moscow. Since arriving from Geneva on Sunday there hasn’t been much time for sightseeing, but they have been to Red Square, the scale of which surely prepared them for the vastness of the task ahead and the sheer size of the venue, built for the 1980 Olympic Games.<BR><BR><BR>'Good surprise' for Argentina<BR><BR>After two days’ practice on the indoor carpet the visitors are feeling comfortable. “Obviously we don’t prefer carpet over clay, but we had a good surprise when we came here; it’s not as fast as we thought it would be, so we’re adjusting well to the surface,” said captain Alberto Mancini.<BR><BR>Neither captain was giving much away at Tuesday’s press conferences about who will play singles, or even doubles. Both teams feature men who can play either, and both Mancini and Russian captain Shamil Tarpischev have the luxury of picking a line-up for Thursday’s draw, but then making the necessary tweaks and substitutions as they go along for doubles and the reverse singles. But they will need to get their tactics right.<BR><BR>Both Argentina and Russia present very united fronts, from their matching tracksuits – Argentina in blue and white, Russia in red and white – up. Although Guillermo Canas is in Moscow as the fifth player, for now the same Argentinean line-up that has featured in all three previous rounds in 2006 has been nominated. “I think this is a very strong team, and a very united team. We have come from the beginning of the year and feel strong together, which is very important,” said Mancini. The Russians seem equally close-knit, although the group is widened by the inclusion of Igor Andreev, who played in this year’s first round before injury, and 18-year-old hitting partner Evgeny Korolev.<BR><BR><BR>Safin the leader of the hosts<BR><BR>The Russians are unconcerned about the speed of a court which has been built to suit them, and on which Safin and Davydenko reached the final of the Kremlin Cup seven weeks ago. “We’ll see how they’re [Argentina] gonna play during the match, because when it’s really fast, it’s not really good for us (either),” said Safin. <BR><BR>Two-time Grand Slam champion Safin is the lynchpin of the Russians, despite being the lowest-ranked member of the host team. The highest-ranked is world No. 3 Davydenko, whose dedication to the cause is unquestioned because he has delayed his honeymoon to represent his country, and practised on the day of his wedding to Irina Vasnina last Saturday. Davydenko’s fellow US Open semifinalist Mikhail Youzhny also arrives at this final with an impressive work ethic, having undergone a month’s worth of rehabilitation in a Moscow clinic to ensure his injured right ankle would be fit in time for this encounter.<BR><BR><BR>Nalbandian the key Argentine<BR><BR>No-one doubts who the driving force and key player in the Argentinean team is, although Nalbandian plays down suggestions that a historic victory in Moscow depends on him. The world No. 8 said, “I can play three days, but the team needs everyone, not just me. If I play good or bad, I have the support of the team, the quality of players to help Argentina to win.”<BR><BR>“I think all the team believe in this chance for us,” Nalbandian added. <BR><BR>Marat audio link:<BR><A href="http://www.daviscup.com/shared/medialibrary/audio/mp3/DC_6751_mp3.MP3" target=_blank><A href="http://www.daviscup.com/shared/medialibrary/audio/mp3/DC_6751_mp3.MP3" target=_blank><FONT color=#cc66ff>http://www.daviscup.com/shared/medialibrary/audio/mp3/DC_6751_mp3.MP3</FONT></A></A> </P>

<P><STRONG>Russia captain chasing Davis Cup milestones<BR>By Gennady Fyodorov<BR></STRONG><BR>MOSCOW, Nov 28 (Reuters) - With a powerful line-up featuring Nikolay Davydenko, Marat Safin and Dmitry Tursunov, Russia are considered the overwhelming favourites when they host Argentina in this weekend's Davis Cup final.<BR><BR>Team insiders say, however, that Russia's secret weapon could be their 58-year-old non-playing captain Shamil Tarpishchev, who has more than three decades of coaching experience in major international competitions.<BR><BR>The Russian is fast approaching the Davis Cup record of former Australia captain Neale Fraser who collected 49 wins as he led his side to four Davis Cup titles in the 1970s and 1980s.<BR>Tarpishchev, who doubles as Russia's Fed Cup captain, has chalked up 41 victories in 62 Davis Cup ties. He has also won 24 of 33 Fed Cup matches.<BR><BR>"This must be some kind of record, worthy of being in the Guinness Book of Records," Tarpishchev, who keeps a log of all his matches on the bench, told Reuters.<BR><BR>"I don't think anybody else has more wins," said the man dubbed a "tennis genius" by U.S. captain Patrick McEnroe after Russia beat his team 3-2 in this year's Davis Cup semi-finals.<BR><BR>Although the International Tennis Federation (ITF) does not keep official statistics for team captains in Davis or Fed Cup play, Tarpishchev has reached several coaching milestones.<BR><BR>Two years ago, the Muscovite became only the third person to win both trophies, matching the feat of Frenchmen Yannick Noah and Guy Forget, when Russia beat a Forget-led France 3-2 in the Moscow final to clinch their maiden Fed Cup crown.<BR><BR>UNIQUE DOUBLE<BR><BR>Tarpishchev also got the better of his old rival Forget in 2002 when he steered Russia to their first Davis Cup triumph, edging France 3-2 in the Paris final.<BR><BR>Last year, Russia successfully defended their Fed Cup crown, again overcoming France 3-2 in the final at Roland Garros.<BR><BR>Tarpishchev, however, narrowly missed a unique double of winning both titles in the same year after losing to eventual winners Croatia 3-2 in the Davis Cup semi-finals in Zagreb.<BR><BR>If Russia win the final, he would become the first captain to guide his country to both Fed and Davis Cup titles more than once.<BR><BR>Tarpishchev said he began plotting strategy for the Argentina clash the minute Tursunov beat Andy Roddick in an epic five-set battle to put Russia into the Davis Cup final.<BR><BR>"Choosing the right surface is crucial to winning the tie," said Tarpishchev, who needs five more Davis or Fed Cup ties to reach a century mark in the coach's chair.<BR><BR>"The hosts always have an advantage because they can pick the surface that gives them the biggest edge."<BR><BR>The Russians laid a slow clay court at Moscow's Olympic arena to host the Americans, mainly to neutralise the speed and power of Roddick's booming serve, and will use a fast carpet surface against the clay-court specialists from South America.<BR><BR>"Both Marat and Dmitry like a high bounce, so will make sure the court fits them perfectly," Tarpishchev said.<BR><BR>PARQUET FLOOR<BR><BR>"Years ago the Davis Cup rules regarding the playing surface were not as clearly defined as they are now so home teams often went to extremes to give themselves an edge," recalled Tarpishchev, who coached his first Davis Cup tie in 1974.<BR><BR>"Playing matches in Central and South America was always the most difficult because those countries would bend the rules to the maximum limit.<BR><BR>"I remember a Davis Cup tie was once held on an asphalt court while another took place on a parquet floor, which was also waxed with paraffin to unsettle a visiting team."<BR><BR>Tarpishchev, who has not lost a home time in the Davis Cup since taking the Russian job in 1997, said he might borrow a few ideas from his Belarus colleague Sergei Teterin, whose team crushed Argentina 5-0 in the 2004 Davis Cup quarter-finals.<BR><BR>Then, after beating Russia 3-2 on a tartan indoor court in a first-round clash in Minsk, Teterin was asked if he would want to meet the South Americans on a similarly fast surface.<BR><BR>"No, we want to play them on an ice rink if that's possible," Teterin snapped back with a wry smile.<BR>The cool-headed Tarpishchev, who also coached the Soviet Union from 1974 to 1991, has earned the deepest respect of all his players.<BR><BR>When a reporter asked Safin how he would prepare for Argentina, the former world number one just shrugged. "Well, we have our tennis genius to think about it. I'm sure he'll figure something out," he said.<BR><BR><FONT color=#cc66ff><A href="http://sport.guardian.co.uk/">http://sport.guardian.co.uk/</A></FONT></P>

<TD vAlign=top colSpan=3><FONT size=2><B>Advantage, Russia for Davis Cup final against Argentina </B><BR><BR>By LEONID CHIZHOV, Associated Press Writer<BR>November 28, 2006<BR><BR>MOSCOW (AP) -- Advantage, Russia. <BR><BR>Argentina and Russia play in the Davis Cup final, a best-of-five showdown that begins Friday. They have met twice previously in the World Group, each winning at home. <BR><BR>Now the Russians are on familiar ground again, and that suits them well. They have gone undefeated at home since losing to the United States in the 1995 final. <BR><BR>"Argentina has a very even lineup and has players to play on any surface," Russia captain Shamil Tarpischev said. "Russia no longer depends much on the court surface. Now we can vary the lineup to get a positive result." <BR><BR>Russia features two-time Grand Slam champion Marat Safin, third-ranked Nikolay Davydenko, Mikhail Youzhny and Dmitry Tursunov. David Nalbandian is the sole star on an Argentine team that includes Jose Acasuso, Agustin Calleri and Juan Ignacio Chela. <BR><BR>"Last time we didn't have good luck here, but we hope to win this time," Nalbandian said. <BR><BR>Russia is making its fourth appearance in the Davis Cup final. It lost in 1994 to Sweden, the next year to the United States, then beat France in 2002 for its only title. Argentina has never won the trophy, but it reached the final and lost to the United States in 1981. <BR><BR>Both teams are unchanged from the semifinals, when Russia beat the United States and Argentina downed Australia. Neither captain disclosed his lineup before Thursday's draw, but both squads are flexible in singles and doubles. <BR><BR>"We have a very strong and very united team now," Argentina captain Alberto Mancini said. "This team has come from the beginning of the year and we feel very strong today." <BR><BR>The final will be indoors on carpet at Olympic Stadium, built for the 1980 Summer Games. It's the same court on which Davydenko and Safin played seven weeks ago in the Kremlin Cup final. <BR><BR>"We pick the surface that will suit us," Tarpischev added. "A too-fast court would have hampered both teams." <BR><BR>Mancini said the court was better than they expected. <BR><BR>"We obviously do not prefer the carpet surface over clay, but we had a good surprise when we came here," he said. "It is not as fast as we though it would be, so we are adjusting well to it." <BR><BR>The last time the teams met, Argentina beat visiting Russia 5-0 in the 2003 quarterfinals. A year earlier in Russia, the hosts edged the Argentines 3-2. In 1985, the Soviet Union beat Argentina in the World Group playoffs. <BR><BR>"I missed the Davis Cup tie in Argentina in 1985," joked Safin, who was 5 years old at the time. "And I also missed the one when I was injured. The only one I remember is that one we won. I hope we will keep this positive momentum and win again." <!-- google_ad_section_end --></FONT></TD></TR>

<P>Translated from Russian by Annie of TGFR<BR><BR><B>“We have won before and we will win now”</B><BR><BR><I>from <A href="http://www.gazeta.ru/" target=_blank><FONT color=#cc66ff>www.gazeta.ru</FONT></A></I><BR><I>by Sergey Bregovskiy</I><BR><BR>Russia’s DC team captain Shamil Tarpischev said that our opponents – the Argentine team are a very strong team with very stable players and also announced that he has decided who will play the singles matches. Marat Safin announced that Russian had beaten Argentina once and will do it again.<BR><BR>As a preview of the DC final on Tuesday Olympiyski Sports Complex hosted a Russian team press-conference attended by our captain Shamil Tarpischev, Marat, Safin, Mikhail Youzhny, Nikolay Davydenko and Dmitry Tursunov.<BR><BR>A few days ago Davydenko’s wedding took place in Moscow, which was attended by all members of the team. As it turned out this event must have had a very positive reflection on the team spirit because they all showed up in a really good mood.<BR><BR>Obviously the first question was related to Davydenko’s wedding.<BR><BR><B>- A question for Shamil Tarpischev. Won’t the celebrations that have just finished interfere with the team’s preparations for the match?</B><BR><BR>Who said they have finished? Weddings don’t last one day we are still celebrating. On a more serious note though, we are acting in accordance with our plan and schedule, all is well.<BR><BR><B>- A question for Marat Safin. You have played Argentina three times already, what can you say about the opponent?</B><BR><BR>I have good memories about those meetings. We beat them twice and lost once. They are definitely a strong team but we won before and we will win this time.<BR><BR><B>- A question for Shamil Tarpischev. Argentines said they are happy with a surface chosen for the match, that it’s not as fast as they thought it would be. Can you comment on that?</B><BR><BR>We laid the court for ourselves in the first place and not for our opponents, it suits us perfectly. If we have done it faster it would have not been comfortable neither for us nor for the Argentines, so we preferred to meet halfway.<BR><BR><B>- A question for Nikolay Davydenko. You lost against Nalbandian in Shanghai. What reflection might this have on the upcoming match?</B><BR><BR>First of all, I lost against him in 2005 and not in 2006. Second of all, it won’t be me who will be playing Nalbandian on Friday.<BR><BR><B>- A question for Shamil Tarpischev. They say Diego Maradona is coming to support his team in Moscow. What is your answer to that gonna be?</B><BR><BR>Kalashnikov* (laughter in the audience). The most important thing is that practically all tickets are sold out. Possible that high officials will visit this match. Our supporters will be there for us and we don’t really care who supports Argentina. We will try to make our fans happy.<BR><BR><B>- A question for Marat Safin. During one of the matches against Argentines you had spent over 6 hours on court, are you ready to do it again?</B><BR><BR>The team has had additions since then. We have many options and a choice of who would play a certain match. As for me – I am ready to play any match if it’s necessary. <BR><BR><B>- A question for Shamil Tarpischev. What has changed in both teams since our 0:5 loss last time?</B><BR><BR>Argentines have a more stable team now that allows them to play practically on any surface. However, our team has also left the times of when we would only play on one surface far behind. Therefore it will all depend on players’ conditions. As for that last match, our main player – Safin was absent and the youngsters that are now the base of the team were not ready at the time. Right now the team is well balanced for playing on different surfaces.<BR><BR><B>- A question for Mikhail Youzhny. You suffered an injury not long ago, but managed to get back to normal. What’s the secret of such speedy recovery and are you ready to play?</B><BR><BR>I am totally ready for the match. Whether I would play or not is a captain’s decision to make. As for my speedy recovery I have undergone rehabilitation on a medical centre of Evgeniy Blum.<BR><BR><B>- A question for Shamil Tarpischev. Have you already decided who will play the singles matches?</B><BR><BR>I think so. But sometimes it turns out that I have to change my decision at the very last minute. Right now I will obviously not say anything.<BR><BR><B>- Mr. Tarpischev what’s a financial content of the final match? What’s the prize fund and if there addition stimuli for the players?</B><BR><BR>In accordance with recommendations of the ITF. The prize fund will be split 50/50 between the national tennis federation and the players. There are additional stimuli. When we won the Davis Cup there were organisations that wanted to issue additional bonuses for the players.<BR><BR><B>- A question for Shamil Tarpischev. The Tennis Federation has supported the idea of holding Winter Olympics in Sochi…</B><BR><BR>The whole country did. How can it be any different? Russia is the only country that won the winter Olympics but never hosted it, it’s nonsense.<BR><BR><BR><I>* nickname of Kafelnikov</I> </P>

<P><STRONG>Interview&nbsp; with Marat from L'Equipe 29 November 2006<BR></STRONG>Translated by emma of TGFR<BR><BR><BR><B>Why are you playing so well during the Davis Cup ?</B><BR>I’m feeling good during this event, I have more confidence. I’m having the feeling that I can’t lose. My last bad result was in 2002 vs Federer. Everybody’s nice with me in Davis Cup.<BR><BR><B>Is it the fact that you’re part of a team with the other russians ?</B><BR>Not at all ! You know, we’re never having diner together, everybody’s living his own life. Davydenko is staying with his family, Youzhny with his girlfriend, Tursunov is doing his thing, and me, I’m on my own.<BR><BR><B>You’re never seeing each other outside of court ?</B><BR>Never ! Even if we’re feeling close to each other. But you can’t understand, this is typical Russian mentality. It’s always been like this. Everybody’s living his own life. But on the court, we are amazingly close. They are good guys.<BR>Of course, we are training, we’re getting massages, we are really professionals, but at the end of the day it’s “bye, bye, see you tomorrow”<BR><BR><B>So during the Davis Cup, it’s zero pressure ?</B><BR>Exactly. Nobody’s thinking too hard. A little story : one hour before his match vs Roddick in Moscow, in the semi final, Tursunov was missing ! We were looking for him everywhere ! Actualy, he was giving tickets to friends in the stadium. He came back in the locker room laughing “Don’t worry guys, everything’s fine” !<BR>Nobody said anything. And he won 17/15 in the 5th set.<BR><BR><B>This is kind of hard to believe….</B><BR>But this team is amazing ! I think we’re having the most relaxed team of all times. It’s the same for the doubles. We’re never training. Why ? Because it’s impossible to stay serious 5 minutes. It’s a living circus : everybody’s laughing, nodody wants to play, there’s zero focusing. <BR><BR><B>Not all teams are like that….</B><BR>It’s because we are russians. This is about culture, mentality. We’re different from the swedish, the swiss or the Americans. For example, during the semi final, the Americans were eating every night at their hotel. Guys ! You’re in Moscow ! How many times in your life are you going to have the luck to be in a city like that? I’d given them a list of really good restaurants. But they didn’t move from their hotel ! ….. We will never do such a thing...<BR><BR><BR><I>Vincent Cognet - L'Equipe</I></P>
