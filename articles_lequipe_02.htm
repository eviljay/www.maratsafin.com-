                  Here is the translation of the article taken from the French 
                  sport Newspaper &quot;L'equipe&quot;.<br>
                  translated by Josee.<br>
                  article by Louis Doucet<br>
                  <br>
                  Marat Safin, elusive and mysterious, is not only the smashing 
                  racket man we see on courts. When we listen to his friends, 
                  his inconsistency and his impulsivity are also a way of life. 
                  A way to put his international tennis star status in perspective. 
                  His manager, Gerard Tsobodian, his ex-coach Marc Rosset and 
                  one of his friend Arnaud Casagrande, expresses their feelings 
                  about Marat Safin's personality, in which they see appearing 
                  a slavic soul (l'ame slave). <br>
                  <br>
                  Gerard Tsobodian: «He doesn't even want to plan his day». <br>
                  <br>
                  Marat's temperament is easy to tame? <br>
                  <br>
                  I'm in a great position with that aspect because I have collaborate 
                  for 10 years with Goran Ivanisevic. When a character like Marat 
                  comes along, it's a feeling of deja vu and I'm able to manage 
                  it. Especially as they are boys who are totally different on 
                  the court and in their private life. They are a lot less crazy 
                  and unpredictable. The key was to understand the situation they 
                  are in and sometimes, to put myself in their place. They are 
                  young people who comes from countries where conditions were 
                  not easy when they grew up. That explains a lot about their 
                  impulsions, their needs, their desires. In my opinion,this is 
                  one charactristic of the slavic soul. They have hot blood and 
                  sometimes, they hit the wall and after, they realize that we 
                  had warned them. <br>
                  <br>
                  When it comes to business and money, is he very directive? <br>
                  <br>
                  He has total faith in me but he likes to be inform and he should 
                  be. Even though he doesn't want to go through details, I make 
                  him realized that it's his money, he has worked hard to earn 
                  it and that's important for him to understand all that. Because 
                  when he will retire, he will have to manage his life and his 
                  money. <br>
                  Is it the kind of questions he's asking you about? <br>
                  <br>
                  Yes and recently, he asked me about different possibilities 
                  that could be presented to him in the future. Earnings from 
                  stock market are not what they used to be. So he asked me : 
                  «Gerard, which investments are you and Ion Tiriac are suggesting 
                  me, which alternatives I have?» <br>
                  <br>
                  Is Ion Tiriac a model for Safin?<br>
                  <br>
                  I think he's a model for a lot of tennis player. He has a good 
                  reputation because he has made his mark on the sport, after 
                  bringing Boris Becker to the top but also on business, especially 
                  in Romania. Every time Marat or other players talk to me about 
                  him, it's « What does he do? How much money he makes? » <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin looks like he put his career in the second place... <br>
                  <br>
                  I think it's a way for him to be professional. It's mostly a 
                  way to take off pressure. He avoids to talk about concrete subjets 
                  like « which tournament you want to play next year or how to 
                  reach the number one position in the world ». Of course, he's 
                  ambitious and he wants to play tennis but he doesn't want anything 
                  that resemble a career plan. He doesn't even want to plan his 
                  day! <br>
                  <br>
                  Marc Rosset: « I was like him at his age ». <br>
                  <br>
                  Is it more easy to be Safin's friend or Safin's coach? <br>
                  <br>
                  Friend. But anyway, you have to be his friend to work with him. 
                  Besides,that goes for a lot of players. To go through all year 
                  with somebody, it's almost essential to count on that friendship. 
                  Marat is calm, reserved and discreet. He's not always open with 
                  everybody, which maybe gives him a recluse side. But his explosion 
                  and smashed rackets are normal. Frustration builds up from match 
                  and tournament and when you are a little bit impulsive, inevitably 
                  there are excesses. <br>
                  <br>
                  In training, what kind of student he is? <br>
                  <br>
                  Mostly, he has to believe in what we are telling him. He won't 
                  do anything he doesn't want to do. He has opinions and a strong 
                  personality which he rely on. When you become famous, everybody 
                  wants to give you advice, to get involve in your life and to 
                  tell you what to do. But, at 21, you need to make your own proof, 
                  to build your own experiences. Personally, I was like him at 
                  that age. <br>
                  <br>
                  Recently, did you talk with him about Davis Cup? <br>
                  <br>
                  He dislike talking about tennis, he's not a tennis fan and neither 
                  am I. He has a lot of interests, he likes to read a lot. So, 
                  when we step out of the court, we talk about other things. If 
                  I compare him to other players I know, Federer for example is 
                  much more in love with tennis than Safin out of the court. <br>
                  <br>
                  Arnaud Casagrande: « He needs those up and down ». <br>
                  <br>
                  Marat Safin's character is always as turbulent as it is on the 
                  court? <br>
                  <br>
                  For me, Marat is a «circuit friend». He lives his life between 
                  Moscow and Geneva and me, I live in Paris. But when we are in 
                  tournaments, we spend a lot of time together. He's an interesting 
                  and engaging character because he's at the same time «head or 
                  tails». He can give everything when he likes somebody, be very 
                  generous and do everything for this person. But in the same 
                  time, he's 21 years old, he has lots of money and enjoy partying. 
                  So, he's not always serious. It's normal, he wants to enjoy 
                  his life. <br>
                  <br>
                  Is it uncommon to enjoy having parties in tennis world? <br>
                  <br>
                  No. There is a night life on the tour. We are not in bed at 
                  9 h 30 watching a late nignt show on TV5! But Marat is able 
                  to sleep late before the day of his match as long as he can 
                  get up late. He can move forward his day like that. It's another 
                  philosophy and I like it. It's very rare that he loose a match 
                  because he is tired from a late night out. The risk is more 
                  about his mental fatigue... to blow fuses. When he's irritated, 
                  he really is. <br>
                  <br>
                  Instead of this, he has an engaging side that seems to make 
                  unaminity... <br>
                  <br>
                  It's his russian side. I know 4 or 5 russian and they are a 
                  lot like him. When you become part of their circle, they are 
                  really with you, there is an immediate trust. It doesn't matter 
                  that I take care of Nico, the competition doesn't exist anymore. 
                  The state of mind is: « You're a friend. Period. » It's really 
                  honest. <br>
                  <br>
                  Does he brood during difficult periods? <br>
                  <br>
                  He asked himself a lot of questions and this is why his off-peak 
                  periods can last a long time. But he needs those up and down. 
                  He makes them work for him, more that a linear journey would 
                  do. Everybody has different objective. For him, it's to enjoy 
                  his life because he knows that he only has one. <br>
                  <br>
                  Does he often talk about Davis Cup? <br>
                  <br>
                  No, he takes one thing at a time. Of course, this competition 
                  has a special meaning for him. It's important and close to his 
                  heart and mostly for Kafelnikov. But Marat is a true professionnal. 
                  But I didn't start any conversation with him about Davis Cup, 
                  even since we know that this final will take place. He never 
                  talked about it once. <br>
                  <br>
