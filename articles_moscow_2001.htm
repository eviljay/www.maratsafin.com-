                    By Richard Pagliaro<br>
                    10/09/2001<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There's no place like home Ч unless you're Marat Safin and 
                    your home happens to be Moscow. The 21-year-old Russian hoped 
                    for a happy homecoming at last week's Kremlin Cup but received 
                    a rude awakening instead when fans booed and jeered him during 
                    his 6-0, 4-6, 7-6 loss to Slovakia's Dominik Hrbaty. Incensed 
                    by the crowd response, an irate Safin vowed he will not play 
                    in Moscow next year. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;I have never been so humiliated in my whole life,&quot; 
                    said Safin, who entered the event with high hopes and earned 
                    a first-round win over Max Mirnyi before his second-round 
                    match degenerated into a debacle. &quot;It was a terrible 
                    feeling to hear the fans whistle and boo me on the court. 
                    I didn't throw the match on purpose, I was trying my best, 
                    chasing every ball, fighting for every point. I have had enough. 
                    I wanted to quit right there after the first set as I couldn't 
                    bear to hear them shouting insults at me. I just couldn't 
                    take it any longer.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    A year ago, the 2000 U.S. Open champion was a national hero 
                    after crushing 13-time Grand Slam champion Pete Sampras in 
                    the Flushing Meadows final. But Safin has struggled to find 
                    his form this year and continued to play despite injuries 
                    earlier in the season. His victory over compatriot Yevgeny 
                    Kafelnikov in the President's Cup final in Tashkent last month 
                    was his his first title of the year, compared to last year 
                    when he won seven titles. He followed that performance by 
                    traveling to Hong Kong where he was upset by Magnus Larsson 
                    in the second round. <br>
                    <br>
                    Safin's pursuit of ranking points and cash bonuses for playing 
                    Masters Series events has caused criticism from Russian Davis 
                    Cup captain Shamil Tarpishchev, who said Safin should have 
                    considered cutting back on his schedule. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;It was really stupid for him to go to Hong Kong right 
                    after his win in Tashkent,&quot; Tarpishchev told Reuters 
                    in an interview. &quot;Instead of playing in all these tournaments 
                    and chasing ATP points, he should have rather focused on better 
                    preparation for playing here in Moscow. That way he wouldn't 
                    have had a problem of getting acclimated once again.&quot; 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Wile admitting he is trying to earn ranking points in an effort 
                    to qualify for the year-end Tennis Masters Cup, Safin insists 
                    his schedule is a product of a plan to improve his game by 
                    playing more tournaments. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;I respect Shamil a lot but I don't agree with him,&quot; 
                    Safin said. &quot;I went to China to get points as they didn't 
                    have a particularly strong field, so I thought I would do 
                    well there. If I had won there, had come here and played well, 
                    everyone would have said I'm a genius. Now people say I made 
                    a mistake. But I'm a grown man now and I make my own decisions. 
                    I also have a coach, Mats Wilander, whom I respect a great 
                    deal. Mats and I decided that it would be better for me to 
                    play as much as possible. Besides, I have commitments to various 
                    tournaments, to sponsors.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    The bond he shared with Moscow fans appears to have been broken. 
                    The Kremlin Cup crowd also booed and jeered Moscow-born Anna 
                    Kournikova during her first-round loss and has booed Yevgeny 
                    Kafelnikov in the past. <br>
<br>
Stung by the crowd's critical response, a defiant Safin initially 
                    said he might not play in Russia again before deciding to 
                    turn his back only on Moscow. He plans to play in the St. 
                    Petersburg tournament, which is scheduled for October 22-28th. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;St Petersburg is a different story, they have great 
                    fans,&quot; Safin said. &quot;Their support helped me when 
                    I played Hrbaty in last year's final there. I was losing the 
                    match but they kept urging me to fight on and it pulled me 
                    through in the end. I'll go to St Petersburg again to thank 
                    the fans for their support but I don't think I'll be back 
                    in Moscow next year.&quot; <br>
