                  confidence is the key <br>
                  by Jon Wertheim, Sports Illustrated <br>
                  Monday February 04, 2002<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>Marat Safin is at once perhaps the most entertaining and 
                  most infuriating player to watch. He can dominate (see the 2000 
                  U.S. Open) or disappear (last week's Australian Open final), 
                  but the key to his success, he tells SI's Jon Wertheim, is his 
                  confidence. Attractive women help, too. </i><br>
                  <br>
                  We'll grant you that it's no small condition. But if Marat Safin 
                  put his mind to it, there's little doubt he could be the best 
                  player in tennis today. He has the requisite booming serve. 
                  His groundstrokes are smooth, efficient -- almost elegant -- 
                  but they yield heat-seeking missiles. He's an above-average 
                  athlete. He plays well on all surfaces and, having just turned 
                  22, he is entering his prime years. Safin's problem -- and he'll 
                  be the first to admit this -- is that his confidence and his 
                  focus are like tenants in a time share. Sometimes they're around. 
                  Other times, they'll go months without making an appearance. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  In Australia, Safin was well on his way to a second Grand Slam 
                  title, euthanizing Pete Sampras in the Round of 16, gladly accepting 
                  Wayne Ferreira's retirement in the quarters, and coming back 
                  after a fortuitous rain delay to beat Tommy Haas in a five-set 
                  semifinal. Then he was unable to summon his focus in the final 
                  and failed to put up much resistance against Thomas Johansson, 
                  a player Safin ought to have beaten with relative ease. As personable 
                  and nonchalant in defeat as he was in victory, Safin shrugged 
                  off the loss, thanked his &quot;family&quot; of attractive Models, 
                  Inc. types seated in his box, and made plans for the evening. 
                  &quot;I reach the final of a Grand Slam and sure, it's disappointing 
                  not to win, but what am I supposed to do? Lock myself in a room 
                  and cry?&quot; he asks. &quot;I don't live my life like that. 
                  I love tennis, I want to be No. 1, but it's just a game.&quot; 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The most laid-back player in tennis recently took time to chat 
                  with CNNSI.com. <br>
                  <br>
                  CNNSI.com: First things first. What's the story with the entourage? 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: I need all the support I can get, my friend. <br>
                  <br>
                  CNNSI.com: Fair enough. Six months ago, you were in the middle 
                  of a terrible slump. In Indianapolis, I asked you what was wrong 
                  and you said it was all a matter of confidence. &quot;Anyone 
                  has a chance against me when my confidence is so low,&quot; 
                  you said. Now you're playing as well as ever. Just confidence? 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: Pretty much. <br>
                  <br>
                  CNNSI.com: So where'd you find it? <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: It's like love. When you look too hard, you don't find 
                  it. When you let it happen naturally, it comes. I played badly 
                  for so long, then I played well in Indianapolis, made semifinals 
                  of the U.S. Open, and slowly, slowly it comes back. <br>
                  <br>
                  CNNSI.com: How does a guy like you, a Grand Slam champion who 
                  has proven he can play at the highest level, let his confidence 
                  get so low? <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: [Points to head.] Losing can make you a little crazy. 
                  Then you start to doubt and it goes from there. People see us 
                  hitting balls for a few hours but they don't realize how tough 
                  tennis is. [Points to head again.] <br>
                  <br>
                  CNNSI.com: You're a popular guy in the locker room. Who's your 
                  best friend out here? <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: Everybody. Everybody's great. We all get along. We go 
                  out to dinner or the bars, I get along with everyone. That's 
                  the thing with men's tennis. We compete. Then we leave the court 
                  and we are friends. We go to eat, we go to bars. Just because 
                  I play you in a match, I have to hate you? No.<br>
                  <br>
                  CNNSI.com: Without naming names, there are some top players 
                  who clearly resent being celebrities and wish they were more 
                  anonymous. It seems like you don't mind being famous and all 
                  that comes with it. True? <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: I want to be happy, to enjoy, that's the most important 
                  thing. I don't want to say that I like being famous or that 
                  I look for it, but people recognize me or whatever, why would 
                  I not be nice to them? We have a good life here. If part of 
                  that means that I am recognized or people want my autograph, 
                  it's OK. <br>
                  <br>
                  CNNSI.com: How much pressure do you younger guys feel to boost 
                  the popularity of men's tennis? <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: People are saying, 'Tennis is going down.' Of course 
                  it's going down because new people are coming up and no one 
                  knows us. But we'll keep winning, we'll get promoted and in 
                  one or two more years, it will be great. Five, six, seven years 
                  ago, it was Sampras-Agassi, Agassi-Sampras, Sampras-Agassi and 
                  no one else. Now I think there a lot of good players -- Lleyton 
                  Hewitt, Roger Federer, Guga, Ferrero -- and we could have many 
                  good matches. <br>
                  <br>
                  CNNSI.com: You're willing to go along with it, the promotion? 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: Sure, I want to make tennis big again. <br>
                  <br>
                  CNNSI.com: So you were in Australia with three guys wearing 
                  badges that said &quot;Marat Safin: Coach&quot; but your real 
                  coach, Mats Wilander, was in Idaho. What's up with that? <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: I just need somebody to motivate me. I need someone I 
                  will feel comfortable with who will make me work to win. For 
                  me, the motivation is the most important thing. Sure, a coach 
                  can make suggestions or tell me that I have a mistake in my 
                  grip or something, but it's mostly feeling comfortable that's 
                  important to me. <br>
                  <br>
                  CNNSI.com: You've been saving your energy and only practicing 
                  for 45 minutes or so a day. What else do you do all day? <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: I watch TV, go to restaurants. I saw Ocean's Eleven. 
                  That was very good. Shallow Hal. That was the worst I ever saw. 
                  Terrible, horrible, disgusting movie. I think the director never 
                  watched it after he finished filming. Stupid movie. <br>
                  <br>
                  CNNSI.com: So what lessons have you learned from the past to 
                  sustain this level of tennis and confidence?<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: You need to feel a little bit scared. Not feel fear, 
                  but know that anyone can beat you, that it's not like you can 
                  just go to the court and know you're going to win. You have 
                  to work. I know that confidence is fragile so I will try to 
                  hold it for a long time. <br>
