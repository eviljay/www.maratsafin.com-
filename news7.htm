                          Moscow, Russia<br>
                          </b>President Vladimir Putin welcomed Russia's victorious 
                          Davis Cup team to the Kremlin on Friday, praising it 
                          for bringing the country its first title in more than 
                          100 years of the competition. <br>
&quot;It's a great achievement by all of you,&quot; 
                          Putin told Marat Safin, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Mikhail 
                          Youzhny and team captain Shamil Tarpishchev during a 
                          private ceremony. <br>
&quot;Our country has taken part in the Davis Cup competition 
                          for 40 years, but only now did we finally manage to 
                          win it.&quot; <br>
Russia came from behind to beat France 3-2 in a thrilling 
                          three-day final at Bercy sports hall in Paris last weekend. 
                     <br>
Tarpishchev replaced Kafelnikov with Youzhny for the 
                          decisive fifth rubber, and the 20-year-old newcomer 
                          beat Paul-Henri Mathieu in a dramatic five-setter to 
                          clinch Russia's first Davis Cup title. <br>
&quot;Winning is always fun but winning such a prestigious 
                          competition as the Davis Cup, in such a dramatic fashion 
                          made your achievement even more significant, more meaningful,&quot; 
                          said Putin, himself a judo black belt. <br>
Tarpishchev said the team was planning to take the 
                          Davis Cup on a seven-city tour of the country. <br>

                          Moscow, Russia<br>
                          </b>Russia's Davis Cup heroes were the toast of Moscow 
                          Monday as tennis, once ridiculed here as a decadent, 
                          capitalist sport, brought a splash of good news to an 
                          otherwise bleak prospect.<br>
After unheralded Mikhail Youzhny had supplied the finishing 
                          touches to a magnificent Russian comeback to defeat 
                          France in the final in Paris, President Vladimir Putin 
                          took time out in Moscow to celebrate.<br>
&quot;This is a great, brilliant victory for Russian 
                          sports,&quot; said Putin of Russia's first Davis Cup 
                          triumph in the competition's long history.<br>
Yet he seemed only to be following the thoughts of 
                          Boris Yeltsin, Putin's mentor and predecessor, an aged 
                          and often ailing man who broke from his reclusive ways 
                          to go to Paris and cheer the Russians on over the weekend.<br>
Tennis and Yeltsin have become synonymous in Russia 
                          - the post-Soviet Union's first democratic president 
                          was also the first to make tennis an acceptable, perhaps 
                          a bit posh but still honest, sport.<br>
After watching Youzhny being tossed into the air in 
                          celebration by his teammates, Yeltsin told reporters 
                          in Paris that the Russians won because their grit and 
                          sprit came through.<br>
&quot;Youzhny proved that he is someone with a strong 
                          character,&quot; said Yeltsin.<br>
But then Yeltsin was a bit cheeky as well, taking a 
                          part of the responsibility for the victory.<br>
&quot;Did I bring them luck - yes, you can say that, 
                          that I was their good luck charm.<br>
Back in Moscow the Russian press set the tone.<br>
&quot;The heroes of Russia,&quot; the Sport Express 
                          daily hollered in a front-page banner.<br>
&quot;In the fifth set: 6:4! Bravo!&quot; the emotions 
                          flowed.<br>
Others compared Russia's victory to a brave defeat 
                          of the French during a European soccer qualifying match 
                          in 1999.<br>
&quot;France-Russia: 2:3 That is the same score that 
                          our soccer players beat the world champions on June 
                          5, 1999,&quot; the Gazeta internet site, Russia's most 
                          popular, said in its leading story.<br>
Russia beat France by the same score in a memorable 
                          match - from Russia's point of view - becoming the first 
                          team to defeat the world champions in their brand-new 
                          stadium.<br>

                          </b>Mikhail Youzhny beat Paul-Henri Mathieu 3-6 2-6 
                          6-3 7-5 6-3. <br>
                          Overall score: Russia bt France 3-2.<br>
                          Mikhail Youzhny mounted an incredible fightback to clinch 
                          the Davis Cup for Russia for the first time in their 
                          history. <br>
                          The Russians became the first team since 1964 to overturn 
                          a 2-1 deficit on the final day, as first Marat Safin 
                          defeated Sebastien Grosjean, and then Youzhny came from 
                          two sets down to beat Paul-Henri Mathieu. <br>
                          Twenty year old Youzhny was preferred to an exhausted 
                          Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who had suffered two sapping defeats 
                          on the first two days. <br>
                          But when Mathieu led by two sets the Russian gamble 
                          seemed to have gone wrong. <br>
                          Mathieu gave everything he had<br>
                          <br>
                          The players had traded early breaks before Mathieu profited 
                          from some nervous play from his opponent to secure the 
                          first set. <br>
                          And he kept his foot on the pedal, reeling off seven 
                          games in a row as he then secured the second set 6-2. 
                          <br>
                          But the tide turned in the third set after a string 
                          of breaks as a third break in the set gave Youzhny a 
                          foothold. <br>
                          The Russian then broke at the start of the fourth but 
                          Mathieu immediately struck back. <br>
                          The next few games saw tennis that was at times tense, 
                          at times brilliant, as both players wrestled for the 
                          crucial break. <br>
                          After another exchange of breaks, Youzhny broke once 
                          more and served out to take the match to a decider. 
                          <br>
                          And the momentum was with the Russian who broke early 
                          in the fifth set. <br>
                          Still Mathieu had one last break within him to level 
                          the match once more. <br>
                          But Youzhny broke again to lead 4-3, and held his nerve 
                          to serve out for a famous victory. <br>

                          </b>Marat Safin powered to a straight-sets victory over 
                          Sebastien Grosjean to leave the Davis Cup final between 
                          Russia and France on a knife-edge. <br>
                          Safin's 6-3 6-2 7-6 win levelled the tie at 2-2, setting 
                          up a winner-takes-all clash between Mikhail Youzhny 
                          and Paul-Henri Mathieu in the final rubber. <br>
                          Knowing he had to triumph to stop France retaining the 
                          Cup, Safin defied the pressure and the partisan crowd 
                          in Paris. <br>
                          While Grosjean had the luxury of a day's rest under 
                          his belt, the Russian came into the match on the back 
                          of a gruelling five-set defeat in the doubles on Saturday. 
                          <br>
                          But Safin, who beat Mathieu in the opening rubber on 
                          Friday, broke the Frenchman in the very first game to 
                          set the tone for a dominant display. <br>
                          He gave Grosjean no chance as he reeled off a string 
                          of powerful service games, and broke again at 5-3 to 
                          take the first set. <br>
                          The players exchanged breaks in games four and five 
                          of the second set, but Safin claimed the Grosjean serve 
                          twice more to close it out 6-2. <br>
                          Grosjean gave himself a ray of hope by twice going a 
                          break up in the third, only to surrender his advantage 
                          immediately. <br>
                          Safin was two points away from victory at 6-5 on the 
                          Grosjean serve but the Frenchman held his nerve to force 
                          a tense tie-break. <br>
                          Safin saved three set points before bringing up match 
                          point with a stunning volley, only for Grosjean to save 
                          it with a serve and volley.<br>
                          Both players again had chances to seal it, but Safin 
                          held firm to close it out 13-11 and set up a dramatic 
                          finale. <br>

                          in the Bercy stadium, won five games running to knock

                          winning their first title because the team losing the 
                          doubles have not won the final since 1977.<br>
&quot;This is an extraordinary moment, there was so 
                          much emotion here,&quot; said Santoro, the senior partner 
                          in the French pairing, whose volleying in the last two 
                          sets was unbelievable. &quot;We had to play at 150 percent 
                          to win.&quot;<br>
Kafelnikov's final nightmare shows no sign of ending 
                          as he has lost the doubles in all three of his Davis 
                          Cup title-match appearances.<br>

Grosjean plays Safin in the first singles on Sunday

                          The Russians were now in fist-pumping mode, Safin's 
                          early shoulder-slumping was forgotten and Escude, complaining 
                          of a sore back, decided the moment was ripe for a visit 
                          to the dressing room.
                          <br>
                          Kafelnikov had lost the doubles in both the 1994 and 
                          1995 finals but the Russian pairing were in the groove, 
                          breaking Escude service in the opening game of the fourth 
                          set and apparently set for victory.<br>
                          But the French were not beaten. Kafelnikov's service 
                          remained a weak link and a careless volley on break 
                          point in the fourth game allowed France to come back 
                          to 2-2 and Safin's service was then broken - for the 
                          first time in the match - to give the home side, in 
                          their third final in four years, a 4-2 lead.<br>

                          Russia and holders France. <br>
                          The world number three used his greater experience of 
                          the big occasion to overcome his exuberant 20-year-old 
                          opponent. <br>
                          Safin took the first set after breaking Mathieu's serve 
                          in the seventh game and won it 6-4. <br>
                          But the young Frenchman, making his Davis Cup debut 
                          in front of the impassioned home fans in Paris, held 
                          his nerve to take the second 6-3.<br>
                          He was aided by one of Safin's trademark mental lapses 
                          early on, but the Russian got his act together again 
                          in the third set. <br>
                          The former US Open champion raced to a 5-0 lead with 
                          two breaks of serve before Mathieu finally pulled a 
                          game back for 5-1. <br>
                          Safin then served out to lead by two sets to one on 
                          the clay of the Bercy indoor arena. <br>
                          And he looked to have the match wrapped up as he pulled 
                          away for a 5-2 lead in the fourth set with two breaks. 
                          <br>
                          But Mathieu, inspired by a noisy crowd, dug deep to 
                          drag himself back into the contest, saving a match point 
                          before breaking Safin. <br>
                          All the pictures from Paris <br>
                          He then took advantage of a bad tumble by the Russian 
                          to add further momentum to his comeback, bringing the 
                          set back to 5-4. <br>
                          But Safin took his next chance to beat the 20-year-old, 
                          serving a match-winning ace to put Russia in the driving 
                          seat. <br>
                          Mathieu was given his Cup debut in place of Arnaud Clement, 
                          who is suffering from tendinitis in the wrist.<br>

                          Davis Cup team rowing as a conditioning exercise for 
                          the Davis Cup final. When he drops the oars in favor 
                          of his racquet in next weekend's final, the third-ranked 
                          Safin seeks to make a splash by leading Russia to its 
                          first Davis Cup championship in history. <br>
                          In today's two training sessions, Safin and teammates 
                          Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Andrei Stoliarov will practice 
                          on the red clay courts in Monaco. A week from now, Kafelnikov 
                          and Safin will shoulder the expectations of a nation 
                          when they take on defending Davis Cup champion France 
                          at the Palais Omnisports in Paris. <br>
                          The winner of the BNP Paribas Masters in Paris isn't 
                          exactly anticipating a welcome reception from the fervent 
                          French fans.<br>
                          &quot;In Russia I have everyone with me,&quot; Safin

                          Paris indoor final. &quot;In Paris I will have most 
                          of the people against me. That's life. Especially in 
                          Davis Cup. It's a team sport. We're playing against 
                          France in France? What do you expect? But it has been 
                          a good week here for me to practice in this stadium; 
                          to play and feel the crowd and get used to the size 
                          of the court even though the surface will be completely 
                          different. On clay, its just a different story.&quot;<br>
                          It could be a story of sound and fury as the temperamental 
                          titan tries to control his sometimes volatile emotions 
                          in front of a loud, partisan crowd.<br>
                          Russian Davis Cup captain Shamil Tarpishchev said he's 
                          pleased with what he's seen from Kafelnikov in preliminary 
                          practices, but it's too soon to assess the form of Safin.<br>
                          &quot;It's too early to tell right now what kind of 
                          shape our top two guys will be for the final, but Kafelnikov 
                          looks fine at the moment and Safin had been working

                          Tarpishchev told Reuters today. &quot;We have no problems 
                          so far, everyone is fit and ready to go, so we're looking

                          with a three set win, 6-4 2-6 6-4, over Marat Safin. 
                          <br>
                          The Australian dazzled the crowd with his speed and 
                          ability to return every single ball. Marat Safin, who 
                          superbly won the Masters in Paris two weeks ago, was 
                          not able to find his missile serve and accurate passing 
                          shots along the line. The newly crowned number one looked 
                          solid and took the first set after breaking Safin once. 
                          <br>
                          A rejuvenated Safin turned the match around romping 
                          to a 4-0 lead in the second. His thunderous serve came 
                          back pounding the Australian to level the match.<br>
                          Hewitt, fighting to keep himself en route for his title 
                          defence brought out the best of him fighting out every 
                          single point but Safin did exactly the same making the 
                          decider a nerve wrecking situation.<br>
                          Safin took an early lead 2-0 but Hewitt broke back to 
                          level the score and give the final set a new beginning. 
                          At 4 all Safin's sluggish backhand return gave Hewitt 
                          the much-awaited break. The Australian waisted no time 
                          and quickly wrapped it up in his first match point when 
                          Safin's forehand return missed the line.<br>

                          at the Masters Cup.<br>
                          The lights went out for both players briefly as a late-match 
                          power problem kept play from continuing for six long 
                          minutes. But Costa, holding a 4-2 lead in the final 
                          set, waited it out, then served out the victory two 
                          games later.<br>
                          Even 16 aces couldn't help the slumping Safin as the 
                          champion little more than a week ago at Paris, Bercy, 
                          suffered his second round robin loss in as many days.<br>

                          a group headed by Lleyton Hewitt now look grim with 
                          two defeats. Safin has complained that the cumulative 
                          results of a long season - he has played in 22 tournaments 
                          - are setting in.<br>
                          Unlike most, his 2002 campaign will not end in Shanghai, 
                          but will carry on for two more weeks as Russia plays 
                          the Davis Cup final against France.<br>
                          Safin began strongly but lost momentum against the gritty 
                          Costa. The 27-year-old Spaniard, a victim less than 
                          24 hours earlier to Hewitt, broke twice in the second 
                          set, losing his own serve once. Safin sent a drop shot 
                          attempt short to lose the set.<br>
                          With the match square, Costa dug in, breaking in the 
                          second game and reaching 3-0 before Safin could react. 
                          After the power outage he tore through for victory as 
                          Safin put a forehand cross-court long. <br>

                          way in enthralling fashion in front of an enthusiastic 
                          Shanghai crowd. <BR>
                          Both players produced quality tennis throughout, but 
                          it was Moya who came through in two tight sets. <BR>
                          Safin had been widely tipped for glory in Shanghai after 
                          destroying Lleyton Hewitt to win the Paris Masters a 
                          fortnight ago. <BR>
                          But Moya has also finished the season strongly and now 
                          controls the group, while Safin must beat Hewitt and 
                          Albert Costa to be sure of progressing to the semi-finals. 
                          <BR>
                          After the match, a tired Safin said: &quot;It is a long 
                          season. A really long season for me and it is tough. 
                          <BR>
                          &quot;You know it could go either way and this time 
                          he won. What can I say? That is life.&quot; <BR>
                          The Russian came out firing, smashing five aces in his 
                          first two service games. <BR>
                          But Moya produced the sort of tennis which briefly took 
                          him to number one in the world rankings back in 1999. 
                          <BR>
                          The accuracy of his groundstrokes and returns were too 
                          much for Safin's flairy, but ultimately inconsistent, 
                          game. <BR>
                          Moya broke midway through the first set with a stunning 
                          stream of winners, only to drop his next service game 
                          to love. <BR>
                          But a second break at 4-4 gave him the chance to serve 
                          out for the first set. <BR>
                          Three times he gave up set point, twice with unforced 
                          errors, but he clinched the set at the fourth time of 
                          asking to put himself in control. <BR>
                          The second set followed a similar pattern, with Moya 
                          breaking at 4-4 to serve for the match.<BR>
                          But Safin produced his best return game of the match 
                          to break back to love with two spectacular winners. 
                          <BR>
                          However, with the chance to regain the ascendancy, Safin 
                          succumbed to his trademark inconsistency, and a run 
                          of unforced errors gave Moya a second straight break. 
                          <BR>
                          Despite giving the Russian a chance at 15-30, Moya maintained 
                          his composure to serve out for an impressive win. <BR>

                          includes French Open finalist Juan Carlos Ferrero, Swiss 
                          Roger Federer and Australian Open semifinalist Jiri 
                          Novak.<br>
                          Defending tournament champion Hewitt carries an 88-point 
                          lead over Agassi in the race for the year-end No. 1 
                          ranking. Barring a near complete collapse, the 21-year-old 
                          Hewitt is poised to conclude the season in the top spot 
                          for the second consecutive year. A year ago, Hewitt 
                          became the youngest player (20 years, 10 months) in 
                          the history of the ATP rankings to finish No. 1. <br>
                          A week ago, Safin sounded like a man eager to see the 
                          season end and begin training for Russia's Davis Cup 
                          final against host France later this month. But following 
                          an impressive performance in which Safin surrendered 
                          only a single set in capturing the Paris crown, he has 
                          been rejuvenated and believes he can take home the Tennis 
                          Masters Cup title.<br>
                          &quot;I'm happy enough with number three,&quot; Safin 
                          said of his current rank. &quot;But if I have the opportunity 
                          to be No. 2 of course I will fight for it. I want to 
                          win, I want to take all the money, take all the points, 
                          and win the Davis Cup, but it's not easy. But at least 
                          I have my chance. I played continuously for the last 
                          five weeks to qualify for Shanghai, now I've finally 
                          made it. If I play like I did (in Paris) in the final 
                          and in the semifinal, I think I can win it.&quot;<br>
                          The tournament begins next Tuesday with Safin meeting 
                          Moya in a rematch of the Paris semifinals, which Safin 
                          won 7-5, 7-6 (7-4). Defending tournament champion Hewitt 
                          takes on Costa in the second match, followed by Ferrero 
                          vs. Federer in the finale of the first day of play.<br>

                          Marat Safin(3) beat Lleyton Hewitt (AUS) (1) 7-6, 6-0, 
                          6-4.<br>
                          Marat Safin gave one of the most impressive performances 
                          by any player this year on his way to a crushing victory 
                          over Lleyton Hewitt at the Paris Masters. <br>
                          The Russian claimed his first title of the year at the 
                          final event of the ATP regular season. <br>
                          But the manner of victory will have made it worth the 
                          wait as Safin gave Hewitt one of the most comprehensive 
                          beatings of his career. <br>
                          And Safin's dominance was never greater than in the 
                          second set when Hewitt failed to pick up a single game. 
                          <br>
                          The match featured the two players who had headed the 
                          rankings for most of the year, before a late slump saw 
                          Safin slip to third behind Andre Agassi. <br>
                          Throughout the week, though, Safin had played with a 
                          poise and confidence that he usually struggles to maintain 
                          for a whole tournament. <br>
                          And when the opening set came down to a tie-break unusually 
                          it was Hewitt who faltered, missing with two forehands 
                          as Safin pressed. <br>
                          If the first set was tight, the second was a demonstration 
                          by Safin. <br>
                          Huge serves and unnerring accuracy from the baseline, 
                          especially on the backhand, meant Hewitt could not impose 
                          himself on the rallies. <br>
                          The Parisian crowd sat stunned into near silence as 
                          Safin blasted his way to an unprecedented love set. 
                          <br>
                          And despite Hewitt's expected refusal to give up the 
                          ghost in the third set, Safin made the vital break in 
                          game five. <br>
                          Rarely can Hewitt have looked so downbeat on court and 
                          Safin served out for the biggest win of his year, and 
                          a huge boost ahead of the Masters Cup later this month.

                          Marat Safin reached his third Paris Masters final in 
                          four years by beating Carlos Moya 7-5, 7-6 (4) on Saturday. 
                          <br>
                          Safin, seeded third, closed out the match with a forehand 
                          down the line, ending a 10-shot rally. He next faces 
                          either top seed Lleyton Hewitt or Thai sensation Paradorn 
                          Srichaphan. <br>
                          Safin won the title here in 2000 and was a finalist 
                          in 1999, the year he made his debut appearance at the 
                          tournament. Asked why he performed so well at Bercy's 
                          indoor stadium, Safin replied: &quot;It's my destiny.&quot; 
                          <br>
                          The 22-year-old will almost certainly play for Russia 
                          in the Davis Cup final against titleholder France at 
                          Bercy next month. <br>
                          After Saturday's win in 1 hour and 35 minutes, Safin 
                          was asked if he thought he would play as well in the 
                          Cup. The French crowd jeered loudly while Safin, looking 
                          exasperated, replied: &quot;It's just a sport, nothing 
                          else.&quot; The fans were right to be afraid, though. 
                          <br>
                          The former U.S. Open champion fired 13 aces to Moya's 
                          four and produced 30 winners, while the Spaniard had 
                          only 14. <br>
                          Safin clinched the first set on his fifth set point 
                          with a drop shot. At 6-5 down in the second set, Moya 
                          had to save a match point with a service winner. He 
                          won the game thanks to errors from Safin on the two 
                          remaining points, sending the match into a tiebreaker. 
                          <br>
                          Safin opened the last game with an ace. At 4 all, Moya 
                          hit a long service return and sent a backhand into the 
                          net to set up Safin's second and final match point. 
                          The Russian raised both fists with delight after his 
                          winning forehand. <br>
                          He now has a 2-1 lead over Moya, a former French Open 
                          champion. Moya had won their last match, in the quarterfinals 
                          of the Monte Carlo Masters in April, which was played 
                          on clay, the Spaniard's favorite surface. The Bercy 
                          tournament takes place on indoor carpet, which is faster. 
                          <br>
                          &quot;It's my surface and I had to win,&quot; Safin 
                          said.<br>
                          Safin lost the 1999 final to Andre Agassi and defeated 
                          Mark Philippoussis for the title in 2000. He exited 
                          in the third round last year. <br>
                          Safin, who was runner-up at the Australian Open last 
                          January and reached the semis at the French Open, has 
                          yet to win a title this year. He is nevertheless qualified 
                          for the season-ending Masters Cup in Shanghai, China, 
                          next month. <br>
                          After beating Moya, Safin said his game felt as good 
                          as it did two years ago when he won the Paris title. 
                          <br>
                          &quot;I've been looking for a long time for that game. 
                          Now I've got it back, I hope I can still play like that 
                          for another few weeks for Shanghai and the Davis Cup.&quot; 
                          <br>
                          Although the Davis Cup final will take place at Bercy, 
                          it will be played on clay. <br>

                          Marat Safin moved into the semifinals of a Masters Series 
                          event for the first time since playing in the final 
                          of TMS Hamburg in May, by defeating the last remaining 
                          Frenchman in the draw, Nicolas Escude, 6-3, 5-7, 6-3. 
                          <br>
                          Safin, who won this event in 2000 and has one other 
                          Masters Series shield to his name (2000 TMS Toronto), 
                          is still looking for his first tournament title in 2002 
                          despite several excellent tournament runs, reaching 
                          the final at the Australian Open (l. to Johansson), 
                          the final in Hamburg (l. to Federer) and the semifinals 
                          at Roland Garros (l. to Ferrero). <br>
                          But Safin says he is not worried about the fact that 
                          he has no tournament victories this year. &quot;Life 
                          is not ending, you know? That's one year without winning 
                          any tournaments, is not really bad,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm 
                          still No. 3 in the world, so is not so bad.&quot; <br>
                          The 22-year-old Russian had already guaranteed himself 
                          a berth in the Tennis Masters Cup by winning his second 
                          round match against David Nalbandian on Tuesday and 
                          played without any hint of pressure or nerves against 
                          the attacking Frenchman. <br>
                          &quot;I have no more pressure, you know, to get anywhere,&quot; 
                          he said. &quot;I can just play my tennis, I can enjoy 
                          being on the court and play some great matches. It's 
                          much easier for me. It's just easier for everybody to 
                          play without pressure.&quot; <br>
                          Safin's victory ends Nicolas Escude's run through the 
                          draw, which thrilled the crowd throughout the week here 
                          at the Palais Omnisports de Paris. Escude notched wins 
                          over Roland Garros champion Albert Costa and ended the 
                          Tennis Masters Cup hopes of number six seed Tim Henman

                          The third-seeded Safin entered the BNP Paribas Masters 
                          after a series of disappointing defeats, but today the 
                          former No. 1 played with baseline brilliance to power 
                          past David Nalbandian, 6-3, 6-2 in Paris, and secure 
                          a spot in the season-ending Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai, 
                          China. <br>
                          The 2000 Paris champion showed all of the shots in his 
                          awesome arsenal, slamming nine aces and firing forceful 
                          baseline blasts to take complete command of the match.<br>
                          Still seeking his first title of the season, Safin overpowered 
                          Nalbandian, who had claimed his second championship 
                          of the season on Sunday at the Davidoff Swiss Indoors 
                          in Basel, in a mere 62 minutes to raise his record against 
                          the Argentine to 4-0.<br>
                          The 22-year-old Russian reached the third round where 
                          he will meet U.S. Open semifinalist Sjeng Schalken. 
                          With the pressure of qualifying for Shanghai now off, 
                          Safin believes he can turn his game on.<br>
                          &quot;I'll enjoy this week now,&quot; said Safin. &quot;I 
                          did start to have some doubts about qualifying because 
                          everyone was so close, but now the pressure is off.&quot;<br>

                          Two-time St Petersburg Open champion Marat Safin has 
                          launched his title defence with an unconvincing three-set 
                          victory over unfancied Cyril Saulnier. <br>
                          The Russian second seed struggled to subdue the French 
                          qualifier, ranked 160 on the ATP Tour, 7-6 6-7 6-3 in 
                          their first round match. <br>
                          Safin said after the match that his preoccupation with 
                          making it into the Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai had 
                          unsettled him.<br>
                          &quot;There was always Shanghai in my head,&quot; he 
                          told reporters. &quot;I want to go there very badly. 
                          It is very important to play good here and get into 
                          the final because it's my last chance to get to Shanghai.&quot; 
                          <br>
                          The former U.S. Open champion needs to make the final 
                          in St Petersburg to accumulate enough points to get 
                          into the season's final tournament. <br>
                          Safin, who made numerous poor shots and double faults 
                          in the second set, said he was happier with his performance 
                          towards the end. <br>
                          He added that he had no fear of facing top seed Andre 
                          Agassi, who plays his first match on Wednesday. <br>
                          &quot;I didn't play too bad and became more sure of 
                          myself as the match progressed,&quot; he said. <br>
                          &quot;We have a lot of respect for Agassi. But we should 
                          not be too disappointed and assume that just because 
                          Agassi has come here we have no chance to win,&quot; 
                          Safin added. <br>
                          &quot;I don't think I am that much weaker than Agassi.&quot;<br>

                          Marat Safin was born in Moscow, but feels right at home 
                          in St. Petersburg, Russia. The two-time defending champion 
                          returns to St. Petersburg Open this week as the second 
                          seed and has his sights set on capturing his first championship 
                          of the season, but will have to contend with solid field 
                          including top-seeded Andre Agassi and third-seeded Sebastien 
                          Grosjean to complete his quest. <br>
                          The talented, temperamental Russian remains one of the 
                          most physically gifted players in the game, but is given 
                          to mental and emotional lapses that have contributed 
                          to his sometimes questionable shot selection and match 
                          malaise. Watching Safin fume during a match is like 
                          watching a lit fuse slowly burn — an explosion seems 
                          inevitable.<br>
                          St Petersburg and its fans have always provided solace 
                          for Safin, who has played some of his best tennis at 
                          the tournament, beating Rainer Schuettler to win the 
                          2001 championship after defeating Dominik Hrbaty in 
                          the 2000 final. <br>
                          &quot;St. Petersburg has great fans,&quot; Safin said. 
                          &quot;Their support helped me when I played Hrbaty in 
                          the final there. I was losing the match but they kept 
                          urging me to fight on and it pulled me through in the 
                          end. I'll go to St Petersburg again to thank the fans 
                          for their support.&quot; <br>
                          Two years ago, Safin won seven tournament titles, including 
                          the U.S. Open, and while he was a finalist at the Australian 
                          Open and the Tennis Masters Series-Hamburg, he is still 
                          seeking his first title of this season.<br>
                          A second-round casualty to Agustin Calleri at the Tennis 
                          Masters Series-Madrid last week, Safin will play a qualifier 
                          in his first match at St. Petersburg. Agassi opens against 
                          Radek Stepanek and Grosjean meets Sargis Sargsian in 
                          his first-round match.<br>

                          Showing the irrepressible passion, violent anger, and 
                          wild inconsistency that makes him at once fascinating 
                          and frustrating to tennis fans, No. 3-seeded Russian 
                          Marat Safin suffered a stunning loss to Argentinian 
                          qualifier Agustin Calleri, 7-6(6), 7-5(5), in the second 
                          round of the Tennis Masters Madrid on Tuesday. <br>
                          In a match that stretched well past 1:00AM Wednesday 
                          morning, Safin's unforced errors outpaced his winners 
                          by a 27-18 margin, causing him to frequently smash his 
                          racket against the purple hardcourt surface. He also 
                          vehemently protested a number of line calls. <br>
                          Calleri, a 26-year-old Argentine, had to play two weekend 
                          qualifying matches to get into the main draw of the 
                          $2.9 million indoor tournament. <br>
                          He rallied from a 4-0 deficit to win the first-set tiebreak 
                          8-6, clinching it on his first set point with a sizzling 
                          backhand down the line. <br>
                          Safin trailed 4-1 in the second tiebreak, got back to 
                          5-5, but lost the next two points, sailing a forehand 
                          long on match point. <br>
                          Calleri was ranked 59th on the ATP Champions Race coming 
                          into the Madrid tournament. This year, he has made one 
                          final, in his home country in Buenos Aires. <br>
                          Safin was visibly upset during the last part of the 
                          match, throwing his racket several times on the court. 
                          <br>
                          &quot;The loss was not physical, not mental,'' Safin 
                          said. &quot;It was just about two points. Maybe it's 
                          luck. I need luck to win a tiebreak.'' <br>
                          After the match, Safin was visibly saddened, as he clearly 
                          realizes that his early-round upset may cost him more 
                          than the price of replacing his broken rackets. While 
                          he stands at No. 3 in the ATP Champions Race, he leads 
                          10th-place Andy Roddick by just 85 points, a slim margin 
                          that makes him anything but a lock to qualify for next 
                          month's Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai. <br>
                          &quot;I'm very disappointed because I really want to 
                          go to Shanghai,&quot; he said. &quot;It is a shame I 
                          lost in my first match because I really thought that 
                          I would do much better, but Calleri didn't give me a 
                          chance.&quot; <br>
                          However, Safin stressed that he is not prepared to give 
                          up on his year, during which he has failed to capture 
                          a title. He will play next week in St. Petersburg, and 
                          then at the BNP Paribas Masters in Paris, and said, 
                          &quot;If I go to Shanghai, I will go to win. Not just 
                          to get the money and lose all my matches.&quot; <br>

                          Top seed Marat Safin had to save two match points before

                          Wayne Arthurs. <br>
                          Safin, who had lost against Arthurs in both of their 
                          previous meetings, came back from the brink of a third

                          will now meet either Gustavo Kuerten or Swiss qualifier

                          &quot;This was a really difficult match for me,&quot; 
                          said Safin, who is in third position in the ATP Champions 
                          Race 2002. &quot;I had huge trouble reading his serve 
                          and he gave me no rhythm. In my opinion, Wayne has the 
                          best serve on the ATP circuit. Sometimes he even pulls 
                          off big winners from the baseline so you can never relax.

                          </b> Top seed Marat Safin needed to draw on all of his 
                          experience to overcome teenage French sensation Richard 
                          Gasquet 6-4, 7-6(5) to reach the second round of the 
                          Grand Prix de Tennis de Lyon. <br>
                          Safin, who accepted a wild card into the tournament, 
                          fought off a spirited challenge from the 16-year-old 
                          in what was a repeat of their second round encounter 
                          earlier this year at the Tennis Masters Monte Carlo. 
                          On that occasion, Gasquet was playing in his first ATP 
                          event having become the youngest ever qualifier at a 
                          Tennis Masters Series tournament and had his first taste 
                          of the big time. <br>
                          Six months later, Gasquet was showing just how far he 
                          has come after winning the French and US Open junior 
                          titles along with a Challenger title in Montauban and 
                          two Futures titles (Great Britain and Germany). <br>
                          &quot;Richard has improved his serve since the last 
                          time we played in Monte Carlo,&quot; said Safin of his 
                          young opponent. &quot;The guy has great hands and he 
                          takes many risks from the baseline. He definitely has 
                          a great future ahead of him. I barely played in satellite 
                          events at his age and he is already beating established 
                          professional players.&quot;<br>
                          Safin, who is looking to win his first title of the 
                          year, added: &quot;I didn't practice on the Centre Court 
                          before playing my match and everything seemed very fast 
                          to me. My timing was a bit off hitting my groundstrokes.&quot;<br>
                          The Russian, who currently lies in third position in 
                          the ATP Champions Race 2002, had a best fifth result 
                          of three points coming into Lyon, and now will add to 
                          his total of 460 by reaching the second round, where 
                          he will meet Wayne Arthurs. &quot;It's very important 
                          for me to make some good points in the remaining tournaments 
                          so I can make it to the Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai,&quot; 
                          said Safin. &quot;I have a very busy schedule ahead. 
                          I should have played better in the summer.&quot;<br>
                          For Gasquet, it was all part of the learning experience. 
                          &quot;It is not easy to play against a player like Marat 
                          on a fast surface like this,&quot; said the Frenchman. 
                          &quot;He serves extremely well and his groundstrokes 
                          are very heavy and hard. I was very happy with how I 
                          competed today.&quot;<br>

                          The Russian broke back in the seventh ame to prevail

                          &quot;I have played him several times and he is a tough

                          couple of years ago, so he has the skills and the experience. 
                          But considering it was a first round match I played

                          the top-seeded Safin lost his mobility and his second-round

                          7-6 (7-2), 7-5 at the Salem Open in Hong Kong. <br>

                          The left-handed Lopez effectively changed the pace on 
                          points to prevent Safin from establishing a consistent 
                          rhythm.<br>
                          Safin's game unraveled in the first set tie-break, which 
                          he lost 7-2 after both players had held their service

                          serve to take a 5-2 lead. The 22-year-old Safin fought 
                          back to level the score at 5-5 and was two break points 
                          up in the 11th game.<br>
                          But Lopez was equal to the task as he held his nerve 
                          to ward off the immediate danger of losing his serve. 
                          He won the next five points to lead 6-5, 40-0, and then 
                          converted his second match point to score a famous victory. 
                          <br>
                          A season that started with so much promise as Safin 
                          reached the Australian Open final and the Roland Garros 
                          semifinals has degenerated into disappointment with 
                          Safin suffering second-round setbacks at both Wimbledon 
                          and the U.S. Open. The fourth-ranked Safin hopes to 
                          salvage his season with a strong showing at the season-ending 
                          Tennis Masters Cup and by helping Russia win its first 
                          Davis Cup in history when it takes on host France in 
                          the Davis Cup final, November 29th-December 1st.<br>
                          &quot;First of all, I have to finish this year,&quot; 
                          Safin said. &quot;I don't think I have any opportunity 
                          to finish No.1, which is a pity. The way I started this 
                          year, I had a big chance and then I didn't make any 
                          good results after Roland Garros. I hope I can finish 
                          in the top three, it is my goal for the moment.&quot;<br>

                          Safin, still looking for his first title of the year, 
                          routed Lars Burgsmuller of Germany, 6-2, 6-2. The 22-year-old

                          at Roland Garros and TMS Hamburg.<br>
                          Last weekend, Safin won two singles matches to help 
                          his country defeat Argentina in the Davis Cup semifinals.

                          Safin faces another momentous week on the ATP tour. 
                          <br>
                          The leading players in the Champions Race will all be 
                          looking to secure their places in the Masters Cup, but 
                          Safin has more to gain this week than most. <br>
                          Points in the Race are made up from performances in 
                          the Slams, the Masters Series events, and then the players' 
                          five best other results on the tour. <br>
                          Safin is lying in fourth place in the race, but has 
                          picked up only 18 points from his five other tournaments, 
                          far less than most of his rivals. <br>
                          So Safin has much to gain at this week's Salem Open 
                          in Hong Kong, where he is the top seed. <br>
                          He faces Lars Burgsmuller in the first round, and will 
                          hope for a turnaround in his recent form. <br>

                        &quot;I feel much more relieved. I feel I have nothing 
                        to lose. Winning the match, I got my confidence back. 
                        I feel happy with myself and my game.&quot; <br>
                        Safin, the 2000 champion, did not play badly but was increasingly 
                        frustrated as his opponent hit a series of crunching winners, 
                        not only off his favoured backhand but also on the forehand 
                        side. <br>
                        But it was Kuerten's serve which was most impressive, 
                        firing 13 aces and winning 82% of points on his first 
                        delivery.<br>
                        Safin, who survived a five-set thriller against Nicolas 
                        Kiefer in the first round, was made to look leaden-footed 
                        as Kuerten consistently found acute angles to keep the 
                        ball from his opponent's reach. <br>
                        After breaking early in the first set and at 4-4 in the 
                        second, it was no surprise when a rampant Kuerten earned 
                        a further break at 5-5 in the third and served out the 
                        win. <br>

                        </b>Former champion Marat Safin survived a first round 
                        scare as he battled past a gutsy Nicolas Kiefer 6-3, 4-6, 
                        4-6, 6-4, 7-6(7-4) in the first round of the U.S. Open 
                        Tuesday . <br>
                        The 2000 U.S. Open winner, and one of the hot favorites 
                        to claim the title this year, needed four-and-a-half hours 
                        on a steamy Arthur Ashe Court to tame a badly cramping 
                        Kiefer, who was barely able to stand at the end of the 
                        epic battle. <br>
                        The second-seeded Russian used every weapon available 
                        to him in an attempt to thwart Kiefer, but was often left 
                        angrily slamming his racket onto the ground in frustration. 
                        <br>
                        As Kiefer hobbled on court in the fifth set, the German 
                        bravely fought off two match points to take the contest 
                        into the tiebreak. <br>
                        But the 25-year-old German simply ran out of reserves, 
                        collapsing onto the court clutching his right thigh in 
                        agony after sending a return into the net to put Safin 
                        ahead 6-3. <br>
                        After squandering his third match point, Safin finally 
                        clinched the match when Kiefer's forehand return sailed 
                        meekly into the net. <br>
                        Safin will next meet either three-times French Open winner 
                        Gustavo Kuerten or hard-hitting Frenchman Julien Boutter.

                        </b>Second seed Marat Safin withdrew shortly before his 
                        match on Wednesday at the RCA Championships in Indianapolis 
                        with an upper respiratory infection. <br>
                        The Russian's late pull-out paved the way for Frenchman 
                        Arnaud Di Pasquale to enter the field to face Austrian 
                        Stefan Koubek in the second round. <br>
                        As a top eight seed, Safin had a first-round bye. <br>
                        The 22-year-old Russian said he began feeling ill Sunday 
                        and has been unable to train. <br>
                        &quot;I haven't been able to do anything for the last 
                        couple of days,&quot; said the runner-up two years ago

                        </b>Monday night's clash between Greg Rusedski and Marat 
                        Safin began as a monster battle, with two of the game's 
                        heavyweights displaying the full might of their firepower. 
                        But after the No. 2 seeded Russian failed to take advantage 
                        of three set points in a hotly contested first set tie-break, 
                        his game completely unraveled, allowing Rusedski to walk 
                        away with a 7-6(7), 6-2 victory. <br>
                        Safin seemed on the verge of taking a pivotal lead when 
                        he took a 6-4 lead in the tie-break. But his play turned 
                        sloppy at just the wrong moment. On one set point, he 
                        missed an easy forehand that sailed inches long. Rusedski, 
                        meanwhile, played rock solid tennis when he needed to, 
                        and converted on his first set point. <br>
                        From the second set on, Safin appeared scattered and discouraged. 
                        Rusedski took advantage of Safin's mood swing and pounced 
                        on every shot the Russian sent his way. <br>
                        &quot;I have no confidence and it's really sad that the 
                        train is going away and I cannot jump on it,&quot; Safin 
                        said. &quot;… I am not satisfied with the way I am playing, 
                        and I'm not enjoying playing this way.&quot; <br>
                        Safin is currently No. 2 in the ATP Champions Race, but 
                        he has yet to claim a title in 2002. He reached the final 
                        at the Australian Open and the Tennis Masters Hamburg, 
                        but came up a match short both times. &quot;I had so many 
                        chances and I just couldn't make it,&quot; he said. <br>
                        Following the loss to Rusedski, Safin said he's going 
                        to try to turn his game around by &quot;practice, practice 
                        and practice.&quot; &quot;If I need 10 hours, I will stay 
                        10 hours on the court,&quot; he said. &quot;If I need 
                        24 hours, I will have to stay 24 hours a day. There's 
                        no other solution to get better in tennis.&quot; <br>
