                  AUG 26, 2001<br>
                  <br>
              
                  By SELENA ROBERTS <br>
<br>
                    The night was creeping into early morning inside a Manhattan 
                    club, where vodka shots were being passed out as freely as 
                    pamphlets, where one hearty toast by a Russian friend was 
                    followed by another. <br>
The mood was made for dancing. <br>
<br>
&quot;I was too tired and too nervous to dance,&quot; Marat 
                    Safin said. &quot;I didn't know what I just did.&quot; <br>
<br>
Safin had just dismantled Pete Sampras to win the 2000 United 
                    States Open. With service returns that splashed down at Sampras's 
                    feet, with uncommon patience to fluster his legendary opponent, 
                    Safin broke out of obscurity inside Arthur Ashe Stadium last 
                    September to win his first major at age 20. Hours later, the 
                    all-night party began.<br>
<br>
&quot;I don't sleep that night,&quot; Safin said, paging 
                    back a fuzzy memory. &quot;I had to celebrate what had just 
                    happened. No one could blame me. I may never win it again.&quot; 
                <br>
<br>
As an insecure defending champion, Safin will be fighting 
                    self-doubt when the United States Open begins tomorrow. Two 
                    weeks ago, as he sank his 6-foot-4-inch frame deep into the 
                    couch cushions inside a players lounge at the Tennis Masters 
                    Series of Cincinnati, he went from chiding himself to counseling 
                    his psyche out loud during an interview. <br>
<br>
One moment, he was spiraling into a deep funk about a 2001 
                    season that has been undermined by injuries and sabotaged 
                    by a crisis of confidence. Instead of gaining strength from 
                    the fact he dramatically turned his season around this time 
                    last year, Safin dropped his head. <br>
<br>
&quot;Magic? It only happens once,&quot; said Safin, who 
                    ranked third on the ATP's 52-week entry system but is No. 
                    25 on the 2001 Tour points race because of his 24-21 record. 
                    &quot;It doesn't happen twice. It can't change from bad to 
                    unbelievable. That's once in a lifetime.&quot; <br>
<br>
But in a contradictory tone, Safin shrugged off his troubles 
                    to reveal an Up-With-People optimism. He was content with 
                    his personal happiness, showed faith in a turnaround and felt 
                    confident about the future of his game.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm not anymore the rising star from Russia,&quot; 
                    Safin said. &quot;I've already done good things. I've been 
                    dropping, but I still have my name. People still recognize 
                    me on the street, so this is not too bad. <br>
<br>
&quot;It's not pressure anymore. I'd like to win again. That's 
                    it. It will come. It has to come.&quot; <br>
<br>
Tortured as he may be, Safin's cue for a revival could be 
                    the United States Open. But he is only one of many top players 
                    searching for inner peace in the season's last major. In one 
                    quarter of the draw, there are three former United States 
                    Open champions urgently seeking one last curtain call. There 
                    is Andre Agassi, who has fatherhood on the way, Patrick Rafter, 
                    who is mulling retirement, and Pete Sampras, who has an aura 
                    to reconstruct. <br>
<br>
&quot;The aura is still there, and I feel it,&quot; said 
                    Sampras, whose disappointing season has left him seeded No. 
                    10 at the Open. &quot;I've been through everything at the 
                    Open. That's where it all began for me. It's the place where 
                    I've won, where I've been injured, where I've been sick and 
                    where I've had great matches. I think with the history I've 
                    had there, it definitely gives me an edge.&quot;<br>
                    The youth on Tour is brazen, though. Last year, Safin provided 
                    the introduction to a new group of players that has talent 
                    to challenge the aging superstars. With the alignment of the 
                    draw, there is an opening for new blood. To plow through the 
                    draw, players like the top-seeded Gustavo Kuerten or the 18th-seeded 
                    Andy Roddick may only need to hitch a ride on momentum. <br>
<br>
&quot;This year I'm 18 in the world going in,&quot; said 
                    Roddick, who lost his first match in his United States Open 
                    debut a year ago, back when he needed a wild card to enter. 
                    &quot;Last year, I was just happy to be getting the chance 
                    to even participate. I definitely feel like I belong there 
                    a little bit more now. <br>
<br>
&quot;I'm going to have to get through the first round or 
                    two, and those are the toughest when everybody is there and 
                    everybody is hungry, and you can't take anybody for granted. 
                    And I'm the type of player where the more matches I get under 
                    my belt, the better I start playing. Hopefully, I'll be able 
                    to get my feet in the tournament.&quot; <br>
<br>
In Safin's case, success comes down to a head game. A week 
                    ago, Safin took a step in a positive direction when he advanced 
                    to the semifinals of a warm-up tournament in Indianapolis. 
               <br>
<br>
&quot;At least I can play tennis,&quot; Safin said after 
                    playing in a celebrity event in Manhattan on Friday. &quot;At 
                    least I can win some matches.&quot; <br>
<br>
Safin may have arrived at this state of unsteady confidence 
                    for several reasons, including a change to a new racket, a 
                    back injury and the selection of a new coach. For most of 
                    the year, Mats Wilander has guided him. In an effort to curb 
                    his self- destructive temperament, and glean some on-court 
                    savvy, Safin sought out Wilander. But some wonder if Wilander 
                    may be too passive in directing Safin. <br>
<br>
But more than anything else, Safin's inability to mount an 
                    encore to last year has been most hindered by his health early 
                    in the season. Concerned with the penalties for missing the 
                    top-tier Masters Series events on Tour, Safin played through 
                    a back injury in the spring when some believed he should have 
                    rested. <br>
<br>
&quot;I think there were big tournaments, and I think at 
                    first I could play anyway,&quot; Safin said. &quot;I tried, 
                    but it wasn't O.K. It was also my mistake.&quot; <br>
<br>
The injury has long since healed, but Safin has struggled 
                    to recover his mental approach to tennis, leaving the question 
                    in the balance: What's wrong with Safin? <br>
<br>
&quot;People should understand that I'm human,&quot; Safin 
                    said. &quot;There are bad days, bad months. Just because you 
                    have this great moment at the U.S. Open doesn't mean you're 
                    going to be playing great tennis for the rest of your life. 
                    You play very bad, a little bit bad and then you can come 
                    back. You know, the stock market, I think it's this way, too.&quot; 
                 <br>
<br>
Safin's ups and downs are just as unpredictable. Long before 
                    this season, he teetered between dominance and doom. In one 
                    match, he would lose his cool, smacking his racket on the 
                    net like a flyswatter. In the next match, he could tunnel 
                    into a Yoga- like trance. On the day he met Sampras in the 
                    2000 Open final, his mind was completely at ease. <br>
<br>
&quot;It was one of those days when you wake up in the morning 
                    and everything is perfect,&quot; Safin said. &quot;Then, the 
                    way I played was perfect. I couldn't have played better. <br>
<br>
&quot;Last year, I had the belief. This year, I'm struggling 
                    for the solution. But I think being the defending champion, 
                    that will be good for me. I think I'm going to play good there 
                    because I have to. In a tournament you've won, you can't play 
                    bad. All the atmosphere, and the people supporting you, you 
                    can't play bad. <br>
<br>
&quot;I want to play well. But let's say I'm not a favorite. 
                    Right now, I can't think big. When you don't have confidence, 
                    you have to take it slow.&quot;<br>
