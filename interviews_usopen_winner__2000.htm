                    <br>
                    <b>When did you first become interested / show an interest 
                    in tennis?</b><br>
                    <br>
                    It was because of my parents. My mother was a tennis player 
                    and she is now my sister's coach. She use to work at Spartak 
                    Moscow and had a group of young players with her. That's how 
                    I started to be interested in tennis, when she was coaching 
                    the kids I started to like it and here I am. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Most thrilling moment in sports</b><br>
                    <br>
                    I think I am still waiting for that moment. That will be the 
                    day that Spartak Moscow reaches the final of the Champions 
                    League and wins it. I have not really lived the one moment 
                    that stays in my head. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What is the biggest challenge you have overcome in tennis?</b> 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Probably to win the Espinho Challenger. At a very difficult 
                    moment in my life gave me the possibility to pass from Satellites 
                    to play Challengers. Before that tournament I was ranked No. 
                    400 and had no money to travel, because I didn't have a sponsor 
                    either. After winning that event I could afford to keep my 
                    coach and travel to tournaments.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What was your most important victory?</b><br>
                    <br>
                    I think beating (Andre) Agassi in Roland Garros two years 
                    ago. I did not expect it, so it was great. It was the first 
                    time I have passed the qualifications at a Grand Slam and 
                    there I beat Agassi. I got in the Top 100 with that one. It 
                    was unbelievable! <br>
                    <b><br>
                    What special steps do you take to mentally prepare for a big 
                    match? </b><br>
                    <br>
                    I don't really take special steps. I try to be relaxed, but 
                    not alone. I like to stay focused but not too serious. I like 
                    to talk to others before the match. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How do you cope with defeat?</b><br>
                    <br>
                    I do not like to lose. I can brake some racquets. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What (thus far) has been the defining point in your career?</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Obviously finding a sponsor and going to Spain was something 
                    that changed a lot of things in my life. I went to Spain because 
                    my parents found a sponsor, a gentleman that helped me a lot 
                    by sending me to Spain, even though I did not want to go in 
                    principle. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>But then, why Spain? </b><br>
                    <br>
                    I am still asking myself why Spain but I think I was very 
                    lucky to go there since, thanks to this man, I met a lot of 
                    people in Spain that helped me. Thanks to them, I am now playing 
                    tennis. They taught me many things about life outside tennis 
                    such as living, living on my own, which is tough at the beginning 
                    but then you get use to it. It was a good and healthy experience 
                    and I am very pleased. I will always thank them for the rest 
                    of my life.<br>
                    Now it's much easier to be a tennis player. To be a good tennis 
                    player in Russia before was impossible. Everything has changed, 
                    because now we have everything. We have balls, we have racquets. 
                    We have people for practice. Before it was a little bit difficult 
                    because of the situation in the country. It was difficult 
                    to get balls and racquets and people left, everybody left 
                    the country so I couldn't practice with anybody so I had to 
                    leave.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What other sports are you interested in / good at?</b><br>
                    <br>
                    I love football (European), but I am not too good at it. I 
                    guess I am too tall and do not move well. I am very, very 
                    bad at playing it. I also like ice hockey very much. When 
                    I was living in Russia I was not that bad at it. There was 
                    an ice hockey stadium next to my home and I had the chance 
                    to play often. I follow the Olympics and the World Championships. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Do you have any special rituals/habits before, during or 
                    after a match?</b><br>
                    <br>
                    No, I just brake some racquets.<br>
                    <br>
                    WHY I LOVE TENNIS<br>
                    <br>
                    You have to like it. If you do not, you cannot win. I live 
                    for tennis and my life off court is evolving around that. 
                    Still that is a very tough question. <br>

                    Movie (current):</b> I love movies and see all of the latest 
                    releases. I liked "Ronin" with Robert deNiro and I also like 
                    "Torrente," which is a funny Spanish movie. I also enjoyed 
                    "Dumb and Dumber", but I would not consider it a master piece. 
                    <br>

                    good entertainment and easy to read. I also read a lot in 
                    Russian. The writer I mention above is North American but 
                    I read him in Russian. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Video Game:</b> I like them, all kinds, especially football

                    <b>Do you eat a particular meal before matches?</b><br>

                    <br>
                    <b>Cars (old & new):</b> I love cars. I have a great passion 
                    for them. My favorite one is the Mitsubishi Evolution VI (Moya 
                    and Ferrero have it). Jaguar and Mercedes are my favorite 
                    old cars as well. I am not a fan of motor sports but I love 
                    cars. <br>

                    I have not started my own foundation. I will start it some 
                    day. I will give money to kids. Kids need more help than grown-ups. 
                    I feel sorry for those kids that do not have enough of anything. 
                    Travel-what are your favorite non-tennis destinations? I like 
                    to go to Moscow. I love it. I also would like to go to the 
                    Dominican Republic, Cancun in Mexico and then to Scotland. 
                    I am a romantic. <br>

                    I am open to new adventures and would like to try jet skiing, 
                    wind surfing and 4x4 bikes. I had a stamp collection when 
                    I was younger. It is still at my parents home in Moscow. Surfing 
                    the net / day trading I am not too good at it, but I am learning.<br>

                    <b>Family How many brothers / sisters?</b><br>
                    <br>
                    I have a younger sister (Dinara). She also plays tennis. She 
                    is 14 and is going to be a very good player. She played the 
                    junior tournament in Roland Garros in 2000. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Any family members with prominent sports background? <br>
                    </b><br>
                    My mother (Rausa) played Roland Garros and Wimbledon Junior 
                    events. My father (Mikhail) was Moscow's champion in track 
                    and field. He competed in 100 meters. My grandfather went 
                    to the war. My mother, a tennis coach, does not give me any 
                    tennis advice any more. She is now giving this to my sister.<br>

                    <b>Who is the most inspirational person in your life?</b><br>
                    <br>
                    One of the people that have inspired me most has been Rafael 
                    de la Vega, who was my coach. We had to stop but, I still 
                    think he was the one who inspired me most.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>If you weren't a tennis player, what would you be?</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Don't really know. I always wanted to be a tennis player.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>How do you deal with popularity? </b><br>
                    <br>
                    At the beginning it is kind of difficult and uncomfortable 
                    but you get used to it. <br>

                    Outside of a big win, what is your "Ideal Day"?</b><br>
                    <br>
                    Sleep almost all day. I would stay at home in Moscow with 
                    no one around.<br>
                    <br>

                    <b>How do you cope with the constant travel?</b><br>
                    <br>
