<P><STRONG>Winners of tickets kindly donated by Michelle Reuter Ticket Manager at the RCA Championships.</STRONG></P>
<P>The two lucky winners of a ticket each to watch Marat play in his 1st Round match at Indianapolis 2006 are:-</P>
<P>1. Jocelyn Fenton of Indianapolis</P>
<P>2. Lydia Warren of Columbus Ohio</P>
<P>Congratulations and we look forward to your reports and hopefully photos.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>For all those who were not sure of the answer to the question:</P>
<P>When did Marat last enter Indianapolis? As I said please note the word enter!</P>
<P>Well the answer was 2002. Marat entered and actually arrived in Indianapolis. I know I was there.He was practising and I will post some photos below and as you will see in the one he was looking at his stomach/abdomen area with Anatoly Glebov who was then his trainer</P>
<P>The next day Marat did not arrive for his match and had withdrawn because of a muscle pull. Funny thing was Amit Naor who was also there ended up in hospital for a night with suspected tonsilitis. Maybe it had something to do with the fact that&nbsp;Marat drove&nbsp;them all from Cincinnati to Indianapolis. Who knows!!</P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman">It was soooooo hot.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I thought I would die out there but I forgot the heat when they announced Marat was coming to the court.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>There was a decent crowd watching and it seemed that the vast majority of them were pulling for Marat.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This was totally different from 2001 when I sat in the groupie row for Pat Rafter.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><FONT size=3><FONT face="Times New Roman">Marat lost the coin tossed and Whitehouse served first. He held serve well and then it was Marat’s turn to serve.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I had a feeling that during that game that he might have an off day.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He did.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He seemed a little slow.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He wasn’t using that good foot work of his and I swear he didn’t use that big backhand of his as effectively as he usually does. <SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>He had a chance to break back after losing his serve but the Other guy held.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN></FONT></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>After failing to break the guy the first third game, the rest of the set went downhill.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Marat just didn’t seem to be his old self.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He looked uncomfortable.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>And the other guy had an answer for everything Marat did. Marat didn’t seem to be reading the ball, he let a few blast by that I know he could have got and he wasn’t getting his first serves in as much but when he did he pretty much won the point. And Sweetly too.</FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><o:p><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></o:p></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>The second set was a little better.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Marat had a little more energy but again, it was the same.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I felt that his game was with him that day and he knew it but he tried to work through it.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Then there was this big controversy with the chair ump and I can’t tell you what it was about except that I found the interaction interesting. At one point Marat was so angry about that he sat down and then fired the water bottle at the chair umpires seat.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Don’t. Know. Why.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>However he got back into the game and won it. Anger was good for his serve.</FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Marat also got a warning for sending one of the tennis balls to Mars. Oh well.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>In the end he lost and for me it was sad but I was close to him that I didn’t mind.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>There was three us sitting right next to each other taking all kinds of pictures.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I didn’t take as many as I planned, too into the match but I have a few that I will post.</FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Afterwards I waited in line with the rest of the fans.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He came out and had a huge line of support.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Everyone was nice to him about the loss and he was the same in return.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Always so polite and friendly to the fans.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I didn’t get a chance to ask him any questions about his issue with the chair umpire because they were usher him away really fast.</FONT></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: Shruti">It was an extraordinarily hot and humid day and I was feeling bad for the players that had to play in it.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I took a day off work, and drove the 3 hours from <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:City w:st="on">Columbus</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">OH</st1:State> to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Indianapolis</st1:City>, <st1:State w:st="on">IN.</st1:State></st1:place><SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>There was a lot of road construction, and then an accident bringing the freeway to halt for a long time.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I called Webby’s contact at the RCA, Michelle, and she assured me that the match before Safin’s hadn’t ended yet.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I finally arrived, but couldn’t find anywhere to park.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It took me ½ hour to find a parking lot that wasn’t full.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: Shruti"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: Shruti">So, I get my ticket, and practically run to center court.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>By the time I get there, I’m totally drenched.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was already 13 minutes into the match when I arrived, and if I’m not mistaken, Marat’s serve had been broken twice, and Whitehouse was up by 3 games.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I couldn’t believe it!<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: Shruti">You could tell Marat was having an off day and Whitehouse was having an unbelievable day.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I was really shocked to see Whitehouse play so well, as I’m sure Safin was. <SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>It must be hard to play someone you can’t study at all because they haven’t played that much, and I’m sure Whitehouse knew exactly what kind of game Safin plays.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It was almost painful for me to see Marat struggling, and I couldn’t imagine how he must have felt.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Whitehouse served very well, and Marat was filled with frustration which he directed toward the chair umpire at one point.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>This lasted about 5 minutes.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Then Marat sat in his chair and didn’t say anything.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The announcer said “Let’s Play!”<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Safin fans cheered him on to get up and play.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>He got up and made a killer serve.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>Later an older gentleman came to talk to him, and Marat began telling his story to him in his animated fashion.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN><o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: Shruti">There were a few break points in the second set, but Marat couldn’t break him.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>It still was amazing to see Marat play in person, and I<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>cheered for him as loudly as I could.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: Shruti"><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: Shruti">I made a sign for Marat that I was going to break out in the last set, but was so caught up in the match, that I forgot Whitehouse only needed to win by 2 in the early rounds.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>So I never got to use my sign!<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>I will bring it to <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Cincinnati</st1:City></st1:place> though in a few weeks.<o:p></o:p></SPAN></P>
