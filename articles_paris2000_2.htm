                  By John Roberts in Paris<br>
                  20 November 2000 <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Marat Safin's first act as he youngest men's world No 1 since 
                  computer rankings began in 1973 was to split his shorts. His 
                  second act was to split an eyebrow with his racket. And his 
                  third act was to win the closest of split decisions against 
                  Mark Philippoussis in a heavyweight final of the Paris Indoor 
                  Championships yesterday, 3-6, 7-6, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6.<br>
                  <br>
                  The daft part is that the 20-year-old Russian Ц two and a half 
                  months younger than John McEnroe when the American was crowned 
                  No 1 in 1980 Ц has risen without trace, his feat unrecognised 
                  by the ATP Tour, even though he sits atop both their Champions 
                  Race and 52-week entry system this morning.<br>
                  <br>
                  Having walloped Pete Sampras to win the United States Open in 
                  September, Safin has now overtaken the Californian as leader 
                  of the system for tournament entry and seedings. But the ATP 
                  Tour, eager to promote the Champions Race, are waiting for the 
                  conclusion of the Masters Cup in Lisbon at the end of the month 
                  in order to be able to declare the year-end No 1.<br>
                  <br>
                  "When I get to Lisbon, I have to play good tennis to show them 
                  I'm not the yo-yo from Moscow," Safin said. <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin enjoyed a joke with the crowd while changing his shorts 
                  on the court after splitting them during the warm-up, but he 
                  had a few light moments afterwards and following his interview 
                  he went to hospital to have his right eyebrow stitched. <br>
                  <br>
                  He thought he might have to retire from the match after accidentally 
                  hitting himself with his racket frame during a tumble to the 
                  court in a vain dive to intercept a shot with Philippoussis 
                  serving at 3-3, 15-30 in the third set. What followed was like 
                  a scene from a boxing match. The tournament doctor, Bernard 
                  Mantalvan, worked hard to staunch the twocentimetre vertical 
                  wound.<br>
                  <br>
                  "If the blood hadn't stopped and I would have had to have had 
                  treatment all the time, the delays wouldn't have been fair to 
                  my opponent, who was running like a dog," Safin said. <br>
                  <br>
                  Plasters on the cut and ice packs during change-overs kept Safin 
                  going for the three hours and 29 minutes of the contest, even 
                  though he had to contend with a severe headache. He managed 
                  to break Philippoussis in that seventh game and went on to take 
                  a two sets to one lead. <br>
                  <br>
                  Philippoussis had cause to rue the three break points he failed 
                  to convert with Safin serving at 4-4 in the second set. Instead, 
                  the Australian was dragged into a tie-break, which he lost, 
                  9-7, on his opponent's fourth set point, after recovering from 
                  5-1 down to 6-6.<br>
                  <br>
                  Excitement was added to the drama when Philippoussis levelled 
                  the match by winning the fourth set after breaking for 4-2. 
                  Both men appeared to be tiring, but neither was prepared to 
                  give way in a test of nerve and endurance in the final set. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Only 12 points were won against serve in the 12 games leading 
                  to the tie-break in the fifth set, and four consecutive games 
                  were held to love. If Safin was groggy, he disguised it well. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  This concluding tie-break was a minor classic. Philippoussis 
                  was first to lead, 3-1, but then lost the next two points on 
                  his serve and faced three match points after Safin sped to 6-3. 
                  The Australian served away the first two, and Safin missed a 
                  forehand volley on the third. <br>
                  <br>
                  Try as he might, Philippoussis was unable to regain the initiative, 
                  but he saved two more match points before Safin lured him into 
                  hitting a forehand wide across court on the sixth.<br>
                  <br>
                  The closeness of the match was reflected in the statistics. 
                  Both players hit 22 aces, but Safin only double-faulted twice 
                  compared to nine by his opponent.<br>
                  <br>
                  "I think I showed Mark too much respect in the beginning," Safin 
                  said. "I was thinking too much, because I saw his matches and 
                  he impressed me very much." <br>
                  <br>
                  As for being No 1, he said: "I think I'm playing great tennis, 
                  and I've won enough tournaments to show it. I'm not lucky, nobody 
                  [in my position] is. At this moment, I am No 1. Maybe some people 
                  don't like it, but that's life." <br>
