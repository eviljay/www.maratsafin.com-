                    Marat Safin will be invited to compete once again in the Liverpool 
                    International Tennis Tournament next year after winning the 
                    inaugural event on Saturday.The world number one defeated 
                    American pin-up Jan-Michael Gambill 7-6, 6-7, 6-4 in the final 
                    to cap a successful week at Calderstones for both the Russian 
                    and the organisers.<br>
                    The Liverpool International will return in the corresponding 
                    week next year, once again giving some of the worlds top players 
                    the chance to prepare for Wimbledon.<br>
                    Indeed if Safins praise for the event is anything to go by 
                    the quality of the field will be even better in 12 months 
                    time,<br>
                    &quot;It has been exactly the sort of tournament many of us 
                    wanted before Wimbledon.&quot; he admitted. &quot;Lots of 
                    practice on grass,a number of good matches played in an excellent 
                    spirit and wonderful hospitality of course. I am pleasd the 
                    tournament will continue and I wil be delighted to return.&quot;<br>

                  <br>
                  Finals Day from the Roving Reporter <br>
                  <br>
                  Well Saturday the 22nd June – Finals Day dawned cloudy but dry!! 
                  By 2pm the sun had come out and it was a beautiful day. And 
                  what a wonderful match up we had in store. Marat Safin versus 
                  Jan Michael Gambill. <br>
                  <br>
                  And it was a really absorbing match. Both tall (6ft 4”) and 
                  big servers – who would dominate? Both players were serving 
                  very well. No breaks of serve though Marat had three break points 
                  when Jan Mike was 0.40 down and true to form of all the good 
                  players, he got himself out of that situation with some excellent 
                  serving. Then later Jan Mike had two break points on Marat’s 
                  serve. Apart from that it was terrific tennis from both players. 
                  Both were volleying though statistics wise – Marat probably 
                  had a better % at the net. His volleying and net game have improved 
                  tremendously and he used the drop shot to great advantage. In 
                  some cases he did not kill the bounce enough and Jan Mike was 
                  able to get to the ball and use his own cross court drop shot. 
                  One huge serve of Jan Mike’s was a fault but so fast it bounced 
                  on the drying court and hit a spectator on the head!! Sorry 
                  folks we forgot to tell you to bring along your shields to ward 
                  off the servers!! Marat says that he doesn’t have a “touch” 
                  in his game but I feel that on Saturday he disproved that saying. 
                  In particular one so gentle drop shot that just popped over 
                  the net and literally died – Jan Mike who was way back on the 
                  baseline had no chance – all he could do was cry out! The set 
                  went to the tiebreak and Marat won it 8.6 with some excellent 
                  shots from both players. First set 7.6 to Marat.<br>
                  <br>
                  Second set and unfortunately the wind had got up a bit and the 
                  clouds caused the sun to go in and out – making it a bit difficult 
                  for the players. In the 6th game Marat had break points on Jan 
                  Mike’s serve but could not convert – much to his annoyance! 
                  The volleys were not going in as well – either long or wide 
                  and the racquet was bounced a couple of times as Marat showed 
                  his annoyance with himself. Jan Mike’s serving was steady and 
                  he held his service games easily. Marat had a couple of games 
                  go to deuce but managed to get through without being broken. 
                  Tiebreak once again. This time it got to 5.3 Jan Mike and then 
                  Marat’s serve failed him and he double faulted twice. Second 
                  set 7.6 (7.3) to Jan Mike.<br>
                  <br>
                  So it was one set all and set for a thrilling finale Would it 
                  go to another tiebreak or would someone get the break? Well 
                  it went with serve – Marat had break points in the 5th game 
                  but did not convert and then in the 7th game he broke Jan Mike. 
                  From then you knew who the winner would be. Marat as befits 
                  the current leader of the Championship Race had moved up a gear. 
                  Jan Mike managed to avoid being broken with the score at 5.3 
                  and Marat served out the match on his serve. 40.15 and tired 
                  for that ace to finish but instead a great second serve finishing 
                  with a beautiful volley. Game set and match Marat Safin – the 
                  first winner of the inaugural Liverpool International. The players 
                  were presented with a memorial plate for Jan Mike and a lovely 
                  trophy to Marat as the winner. The first name to be entered 
                  on it? Who will be next. <br>
                  <br>
                  They were both presented with a liver bird each as a momento 
                  of Liverpool. The mayor was on hand as well as Steven Gerrard 
                  of Liverpool FC – another famous member of Liverpool. Councillor 
                  Storey promised that the Tournament would continue and the players 
                  both thanked the city, the public and Anders Borg – Tournament 
                  Director for a wonderful tournament which they had both enjoyed. 
                  Then it was lots of signing for the fans milling around by the 
                  players before Jan Mike was back on court as he was also in 
                  the Doubles Final. He played doubles with Scott Humphries from 
                  LA and they were up against a seasoned doubles pairing in Sandon 
                  Stolle and Joshua Eagle of Australia. In a rousing encounter 
                  – Sandon and Joshua won 6.4 6.1.<br>
                  <br>
                  A wonderful end to the tournament and here’s to a bigger and 
                  better one next year. All those spectators who made it saw some 
                  wonderful players and couldn’t get over the fact that these 
                  international stars were just walking amongst them. <br>
