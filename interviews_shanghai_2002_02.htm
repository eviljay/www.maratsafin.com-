                  Marat Safin - Albert Costa (ESP) 6-3, 4-6, 3-6<br>
                  An interview with: MARAT SAFIN</b><br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: You try and try, but finally you have no more legs. 
                  How much are you upset about the physical condition? You are 
                  clearly tired. <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: But I really think that wasn't actually the physical 
                  problem because I was up 6?3, 2?1 and then serving and then 
                  suddenly just I lost that game, like 0?40 and then suddenly 
                  I lost the confidence, I lost a little bit and the timing and 
                  the game, I lost my game and I lost ?? just I couldn't find 
                  it and then Costa he got confident and just I couldn't come 
                  back. I tried and I tried, you know, but then he was all the 
                  time, he was ?? he had too much confidence and I was making 
                  mistakes and the third set, unfortunately, he made me a break, 
                  very early, because otherwise if I would stay a little bit without 
                  any breaks, I could have break him at 4?4, for example, or, 
                  you know, 3?3 when the match getting to, you know, to be finished, 
                  then he would ?? I think he would be nervous because I'm all 
                  the time, I was attacking and just trying to go to the net so 
                  I would have more chances, but unfortunately he made me break 
                  very early in the third set and I just ?? I lost my game completely 
                  and I couldn't come back.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: Do you still hold hope of winning the tournament, 
                  of reaching the semifinals?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Today?<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: Do you have some hope that you can still make the 
                  semifinals? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: How can I make the semifinals? <br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: You can still make it; it's possible.<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: No, it's not possible because two lose and one 
                  win is not enough. I should have won today, but today was my 
                  last chance. <br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: Technically there is a situation where there can be 
                  three players on one win.<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: You know, is only one chance out of thousands.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: Do you think your match against Lleyton Hewitt had 
                  a big bearing on the end of season No. 1? Do you think you can 
                  lift yourself for that match?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: For me, like ?? but of course, but I don't know, 
                  is a question with ?? is a tough question, because the way I'm 
                  playing right now, you know, like I lost. For me, it was the 
                  last chance was today and I had it in my hands. I had it right 
                  there, just I had to take it. I couldn't make it. So I don't 
                  think right now I'm good enough to beat Lleyton Hewitt the way 
                  I'm playing right now, you know, I lost a little bit of my confidence 
                  and just I don't think I have any chances to get into semifinals 
                  and just I will come up and I'll play my match and whatever 
                  come, you know, I'll try to beat Lleyton, you know, just for 
                  my self confidence, but I don't think there is any chance for 
                  me to be in the semifinals. Is not fair, would be not fair for 
                  the players. Not good enough to be there.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: What is the court like? The conditions compared to 
                  Paris where you beat Lleyton quite convincingly last week.<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: For me, seems like the court is fast, but the balls 
                  are slow, because after two games, they're getting too big and 
                  for my game, you know, like I'm all the time attacking and every 
                  time I'm trying to get to the net or try to, you know, hit the 
                  ball hard, just, you know, they have a lot of time, they have 
                  a lot of time and I cannot make winner and I cannot make ?? 
                  I cannot attack because they have always time and they can play 
                  it. So it's getting ?? the balls, they are making the game a 
                  little bit slower and for me to adjust, I couldn't adjust to 
                  this kind of game because the way I played in Paris, it was 
                  basically the balls were fast and the court was a little bit 
                  fast, but basically the court was the same lime here, but the 
                  balls they stayed the same, they had the same speed, even after 
                  three game, even after seven games and that's why the surface 
                  still working and then I could play ?? I could put pressure 
                  but, you know, if I'm trying to make fast point, still there, 
                  they are making passing shots and it doesn't work, you know, 
                  so I need to play from the baseline a little bit longer and 
                  I couldn't, I couldn't adjust. I couldn't adjust my game to 
                  that kind of balls, but that's my problem, you know.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: During the third set, there is something wrong with 
                  the light. Why do you refuse to continue the match and sit by 
                  the side of the court?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Because some people they will not call it sportsmanship, 
                  but there is, you know, like when the lights went off, you think 
                  there is opportunity to know that Costa would lose his confidence 
                  and he will lose a little bit the timing that he had. He was 
                  playing great tennis and I thought I sit down there and I just 
                  try to break the rhythm, but he was too good for that and they 
                  just push me to play. It was my last opportunity. It was my 
                  last opportunity. I had to take it and didn't work.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: I don't suppose the lights went out on the year, you 
                  still have the Davis Cup. What kind of a year has this been 
                  for you, when you look back at 2000, US Open winner, and so 
                  on? Is this what you envisioned for yourself this year?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: It's really strange year for me. I started really, 
                  really well. I didn't win the finals of Australian Open when 
                  I should have won; everybody thinks so. Maybe Johansson was 
                  too good for me, maybe I wasn't ?? I was a little bit too nervous 
                  being in the final and then from then, I had some good tournaments, 
                  but I didn't make anything big, you know, I couldn't make ?? 
                  I was making good results. I made finals of Hamburg, which is 
                  not bad; I made semifinals of Roland Garros, but there's all 
                  this not bad, but it never game, you know, good, you know, good 
                  few weeks which I couldn't ?? that I could have won couple of 
                  tournaments, you know , because I had the opportunity and then 
                  afterwards, after Roland Garros, I lost my game, I lost everything, 
                  all the confidence that I had, then to come back, it was really 
                  tough. I couldn't find my game even in States. I didn't make 
                  any good at US Open was terrible, terrible tournament for me 
                  and then suddenly, you know, I start to make, you know ?? started 
                  to go back, you know. With Volkov, I tried to go back with him 
                  and slowly the results come back. Quarter finals for me was 
                  unbelievably big at that time because the way I was playing, 
                  I make couple of quarter finals, I make one semifinals in Moscow 
                  and then I won the tournament in Paris, which is really good, 
                  but I expect more of that year, of this year, because I was 
                  No. 1 in the Champions Race and I thought that I had a chance 
                  to finish the year No. 1, yeah, because I was really far from 
                  all the other players; from Hewitt, I was really far. It was 
                  like 100 points behind, 150, something like that, but just, 
                  you know, you cannot be depressed because of that. That's life, 
                  you know, because sometimes the thing that not going the way 
                  that you want and you have to live with that and you have to 
                  think about next year already. This year is finished. I have 
                  no chances to do any good here, we still have a Davis Cup which 
                  is the last hope for me and for Russian tennis to win it and 
                  there is always next year. <br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: You used to smash your racket and shout. Does that 
                  mean that your self control is much better than before? The 
                  second question is: you made 16 ace serves tonight. Do you think 
                  you were going to be a serving machine just like Ivanisevic? 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: The first question, I got tired of shouting and 
                  breaking rackets and just like I cannot any more. I just have 
                  no ?? I have no more power for that. I have no more power and 
                  I just ?? I don't want it any more. 16 aces is not even enough 
                  to win the match. You should play also from ?? do something 
                  else than just serving. And today I had to make it, but I couldn't. 
                  Didn't deserve to win. Even with 16 aces, not good enough. Keep 
                  on working.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: It seems you were not fully involved in the last two 
                  matches. I mean, there is no sign of that Safin in Paris. Are 
                  you concerning about the Davis Cup final during this event?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: No, I just ?? you cannot play every week really 
                  good tennis. Sometimes you have a great week that everybody 
                  ?? I mean, everything is on your side, the luck is on your side. 
                  When you decide to play down the line, you make unbelievable 
                  down the line. When you make drop shot, the drop shot is just 
                  bouncing perfect. When you go to the net, you get every ball 
                  and you just, you know, like two, three balls, every time the 
                  luck is not on my mind. When I am trying to change the game 
                  down the line, I'm missing a bit. The serve doesn't ?? the second 
                  serve didn't really, you know, like went the way I wanted, you 
                  know, didn't serve very important point the way I should. So 
                  is like ?? you cannot play, it's impossible. You cannot have 
                  every day perfect day in your life. Just you can't. It's like 
                  a normal person has bad days, good days. This week I had two 
                  bad days in a row. So, you know, it happens, but I have to shoot 
                  myself, I have to cry, to shout, I have to pray? No, just, you 
                  know, like have to work a little bit on that subject, you know, 
                  just some things and to improve so next time I'll be a little 
                  bit better.<br>
