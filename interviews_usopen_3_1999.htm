                    play clay courts coming into the US Open? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No. I just -- I like to play in Europe 
                    more. All the clay courts are in Europe. I prefer to stay 
                    in Europe because it's very close to my house. If you want 
                    to play in hard court, you have to go to America. I don't 
                    like this. <br>

                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>No, I like. But it's too much time for 
                    me because if I'm very far from home, two weeks, I'm finished.

                    a summer of losses? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No. I said before, I lost six first rounds. 
                    I just came here, I don't know, to make something, to try 
                    to make something. And I lost first round of New Haven to 
                    Woodforde. I was playing better, much better than before. 
                    I played unbelievable tennis in Long Island. After I play 
                    better and better with each match. I take more confidence 
                    from each match. Because I beat Berasategui, Dewulf, and I'm 
                    playing quite good here. <br>

                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Maybe I'm more clever than before because 
                    now I know what I have to do in the difficult moments of the 
                    match, of my game, because since the French Open I make six 
                    first rounds. Now I have to know -- what I have to do, what 
                    I need to do in this situation. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> Anna Kournikova yesterday was talking about 
                    remembering how she was playing with you when you were very 
                    young. She remembers it as a very nice time, that she enjoyed 
                    playing with you. What do you remember from those times? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>She enjoy, for sure, because she beat 
                    me all the time (laughter).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> Was she a nice winner?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah. It's normal that she beat me, I 
                    think, in this age. It was nice game we played. We spend a 
                    lot of time playing matches. It's really nice.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION: </b>She remembered that you used to hit the ball 
                    hard and hit the fences a lot. Were you always a big hitter, 
                    even when you were young?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah. But before I didn't have so much power. 
                    All my balls was going not so fast. So she get easy, for her 
                    it was easy. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION: </b>Was it difficult for you as a boy to lose 
                    to a girl, or she was so good then it didn't matter? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No, for sure. When you are losing to a 
                    girl, I say, "What are you doing? It's not normal." But it 
                    happens in this age. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> How old were you? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>I was just 12 years old -- <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> Were you teased a lot about it?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> What's being teased? <br>
                    <b><br>
                    QUESTION:</b> People joked about it, made fun. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> One more time? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> Did they make fun of you?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Yeah, for sure. It's normal. Everybody 
                    telling me, "How can you lose to this girl? I mean, it's not 
                    normal." But I was losing the next day again, so. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> Where was this? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> It was in Bollettieri Academy. I was just 
                    there for two weeks. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION: </b>You mean Nick's academy? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yes.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> You said you wanted to come here to do something. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Yeah.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> Do you feel like you've done something so 
                    far, or is there still plenty more?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah. I think I make more than something 
                    because I beat Gustafsson. He was Top 10 before, after I beat 
                    the youngster from the United States Dent, now Muster. He 
                    was No. 1 in the world. I think I beat a lot of people that 
                    are playing unbelievable tennis. So it's more confidence for 
                    me. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION: </b>But still you don't have any wins over Anna 
                    Kournikova. Would you challenge her to another match?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Last match I won, after we finished to 
                    play these games. <br>

                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>No. Because I have to play -- I have to 
                    improve my game to win this tournament. I think I'm not playing 
                    so well to win this tournament. <br>

                    <br>

                    difficult points, I believe. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah. But I have to improve more to win

                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I have to be maybe not so nervous on these 
                    moments, just to think and not going for too much, just to 
                    think each ball, when you're hitting each ball, what you have 
                    to play.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION: </b>Is that what happened when you played Mantilla 
                    on Long Island? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yes. I was going for too much. It was 
                    my, I don't know, I had to stop and say, "What is happen now 
                    on the court? What I have to do? What I have to play?" I was 
                    going just all the way playing for too much, make bad decisions 
                    in the game. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION: </b>You've now played three Grand Slam champions

                    them, yet you've had these six first round losses. Is it something 
                    about these major events that brings out the best in you?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think it's motivation for me, Grand

                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I don't know. Five sets, it's too much 
                    I think for me, because I am losing concentration every time. 
                    Like today, the third set, it was 6-1 or maybe 6-2. I lose 
                    completely my concentration.<br>

                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Spending? I'm not spend so much money 
                    because I didn't win so much money. I have nothing to spend. 
                    I think just for travel, to pay my coach, to buy some things, 
                    but nothing special. <br>

                    <b>QUESTION:</b> You don't think you can win this tournament, 
                    does it maybe help you relax, you're not expecting so much 
                    out of yourself, makes it easier to play relaxed? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No. But if you're asking me this question, 
                    and I play against Sampras, what do you want to hear? I mean, 
                    if I play against Sampras, it's 90% that I will lose, I think 
                    so. I think so. Maybe you think, I don't know, other way. 
                    But I think I don't have so much chances against Sampras because 
                    he was seven years, how many years No. 1?<br>
