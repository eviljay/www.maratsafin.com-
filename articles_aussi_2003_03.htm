                  By Sandra Harwitt <br>
                  <a href="http://tennisreporters.net/" target="_blank">tennisreporters.net </a><br>
<br>
                  <br>
                    From the time Marat Safin arrived in Australia, he made it 
                    know that he thinks the tennis season is way too long and 
                    the end-of-season vacation is way too short. For the '00 US 
                    Open champ, last year's season was longer than for most as 
                    he worked overtime, leading Russia to its first ever Davis 
                    Cup victory at the end of November. <br>
<br>
Safin, a highly talented player sometimes accused of not 
                    always being focused on his tennis, said he wasn't ready for 
                    action this early in January. On Saturday, Safin finally decided 
                    to stop trying to play and walked away from playing a third 
                    round match, giving Ranier Schuettler of Germany a free pass 
                    into the fourth round of the Australian Open. <br>
<br>
&quot;My wrist is bothering me and I decided not to play,&quot; 
                    said Safin, a finalist in Melbourne last year. &quot;In the 
                    first match, I fall down, and then I hit the backhand a little 
                    bit too late, and I felt some pain here. Afterwards, for the 
                    second match, they put me injection, so I didn't feel in the 
                    second match. Afterwards, at night, I had my wrist really 
                    big. Just I couldn't move it. So no reason to play.&quot; 
                    <br><br>

                    Safin said he was advised by the doctor not to play and offered 
                    a very reasonable explanation for not trying to go forward, 
                    saying, &quot;The year is just beginning. (This is) just one 
                    tournament, why would I destroy all my season? I prefer to 
                    stop now, even if it's a Grand Slam. Still the health is more 
                    important than the rest of the things.&quot; <br>
<br>
When Safin arrived in Australia, he had no complaints about 
                    his wrist, but he was forced to pull out of the Sydney event 
                    the week before the Open with a shoulder injury and was taking 
                    anti-inflammatory medication. During his first two matches 
                    in Melbourne, he was taking painkillers to ease the pain from 
                    the shoulder. <br>
<br>
SECOND YEAR OF FRUSTRATION <br><br>

                    For Safin, the early exit from the Australian Open has to 
                    be frustrating, especially after his failure to take the trophy 
                    at last year's tournament. Safin, who has long been touted 
                    as a given to be a multiple Grand Slam champion, was considered 
                    a shoo-in to defeat Thomas Johansson in last year's final. 
                    But as has happened to him in the past, Safin fell apart in 
                    that match, lost his way and failed to live up to his potential. 
                 <br>
<br>
At the beginning of the Open, when asked about his hopes 
                    for this year in perspective to his disappointment 12 months 
                    ago in Melbourne, Safin sized up the situation clearly. <br>
<br>
&quot;Last year is history already Ц it was one year ago,&quot; 
                    he said. &quot;This is another chance, another year, another 
                    tournament. I would like to do the same thing. It's difficult 
                    because it's another year. You are not playing the same tennis. 
                    The other people are not playing the same tennis. The situation 
                    is difficult. But I think I still have a great potential to 
                    do well here, and we'll see if I will be able to make it.&quot; 
                    <br><br>

                    Now Safin knows he won't make it this year and needs to look 
                    ahead to the other three Grand Slams for glory making in 2003. 
                 <br>
<br>
There's no denying that Safin is a great talent Ц most tennis 
                    pundits will tell you that he should be the No. 1 player in 
                    the world more than Lleyton Hewitt. But Hewitt has one important 
                    element that still seems to elude Safin Ц an unquenchable 
                    desire to succeed. The feisty Hewitt, attempting to become 
                    the first Australian since Mark Edmondson in 1976 to keep 
                    the Open trophy at home Down Under, never allows his desperation 
                    to win wane. Where Safin seems to run hot and cold when it 
                    comes to keeping his head and his desire in check, Hewitt 
                    never falters in his quest to win, win, win, at all costs. 
                    <br><br>

                    For now, it will be a wait-and-see situation as to whether 
                    Safin will be able to live up to his potential in 2003 and 
                    score a second career Grand Slam title. One thing that tennis 
                    fans can be sure of is that however it turns out this season 
                    for the Russian, with Safin, it's guaranteed to be an entertaining 
                    journey. <br>
<br>
Safin's early Australian Open departure opens his portion 
                    of the draw for the highly touted Swiss Roger Federer and 
                    2002 Wimbledon finalist David Nalbandian, who will face each 
                    other in the fourth round for a shot at the quarterfinals.
