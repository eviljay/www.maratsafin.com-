                    Q. Marat, last year you had the elbow, you had lots of problems; 
                    now there's all these guys this year are hurt. Are you healthy 
                    and do you think maybe it's fair you get some luck this time?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. I think I'm the only one in the draw who is healthy, more 
                    or less, because as we can see everbody has a problem. So 
                    of course it is the beginning of the year and everybody was 
                    on vacations and I was working, so no vacations for me. I'm 
                    ready and I'm feeling well, healthy, and I want to do well 
                    here.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Can you tell us about your work?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. About my work? It is a secret. It is a special preparation. 
                    No, nothing special; just I had enough time between last year 
                    and this year just beginning, I had almost two months and 
                    I had enough time to go to vacations and enough time to get 
                    prepared for this year. I had almost four weeks of hard work 
                    and, as you can see - the girl who is behind you, she saw 
                    me - I was working hard and I'm doing well.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. When so many seeds go out and you are preparing for a match, 
                    it could be difficult, do you start thinking, &quot;If I'm 
                    not spot on here I could be another one going out the door&quot;?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. You need to have this in your mind, so you have to play 
                    from the beginning until the end, until the last point, and 
                    that is what I did. And of course the second set wasn't the 
                    best set I ever played, but I was there and I saved four set 
                    points, and I played well, I think, great serve and volley, 
                    and I'm getting more confident, more and more. I'm ready to 
                    play and I'm ready to make good results here. I think I have 
                    a good chance.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Just on that: given the number of seeds that go out, would 
                    you say this is your best opportunity of winning a Grand Slam 
                    in how long?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. I don't know, because you still have other guys who are 
                    playing well, and the young guys that you didn't even heard 
                    about them but they are doing well and they are very dangerous, 
                    and everybody wants to do well here and everybody I think 
                    realised that all the big players are out. So also me, I want 
                    to do well here, it is a huge opportunity, but we have a very 
                    tough part of the draw: we have Roddick, we have Sampras, 
                    I have Escude and Youzhny, the biggest star in Russia, and 
                    it is difficult, you know. Everybody wants to win and everybody 
                    wants to do well.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Marat, you mentioned that you have got to look out for 
                    the young guys: do you not consider yourself one of the young 
                    guys any more?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. No, of course, I'm still young, I think - 21, in two weeks 
                    I'm going to be 22 - so I think I still can play tennis and 
                    I have very good motivation and I'm young and of course I 
                    want to win as many Grand Slams as I can. I have a good chance 
                    here, so why not here?<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Marat, is the fact that you were able to save those set 
                    points and get through a set like that a good sign that you 
                    are mentally strong and focused?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. Yes, because you have to be careful if you lose one set 
                    here and you can be in big trouble, because it is five-set 
                    match and you have to fight; and Rochus, he is a tough guy, 
                    he can run forever and he has very good hands so he can drive 
                    you crazy on the court so you have to be careful against these 
                    kind of players.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Would you say you are stronger in that department than 
                    you have been in the past?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. Just - I'm trying to be focused, trying to stay - I have 
                    to be a tough guy on the court so everybody has to be scared 
                    of me, and everybody has to work a little bit harder than 
                    normally to beat me.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Is Mats Wilander here?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. No, he's not here.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Do you still plan to work with him?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. Yes, just he didn't come here, but I think we are still 
                    going to work, and I think he is coming to the States.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Has your coaching situation sort of stabilised a bit over 
                    the last - - -<br>
                    <br>
                    A. I have no problems. I have a big friend of mine, he is 
                    starting with me, and we are doing well I think. I'm playing 
                    good, we enjoy, you know, practising, we are doing well. Slowly 
                    we are getting closer and closer to the top 10, and then I 
                    think I have a chance to at least to finish the year No. 1, 
                    so we are doing everything right and I don't have any problems.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Marat, obviously you have put last year behind you. After 
                    2000, have you sort of found it a little bit difficult last 
                    year at times? <br>
                    <br>
                    A. The problem is that the schedule was a little bit too tough 
                    for me, because we finished the Master's, like I said, in 
                    2000 in the first week of December, so I need to have my vacations 
                    and I didn't have enough time to prepare myself for 2001. 
                    So of course I got injured straight away, and all the year 
                    was a disaster. But still I managed to win two tournaments, 
                    make quarter-finals in Wimbledon and semi-finals at US Open 
                    and I stayed in the top 20, I almost finished top 10 - I finished 
                    11. So I think this year I will be much better.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Marat, you and a lot of the other young guys have Sampras 
                    in your half of the draw; how much do you younger guys still 
                    respect his reputation and his ability?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. I think everybody knows that Pete is the biggest ever. 
                    He won 13 Grand Slams and you have to respect his game. It 
                    is Pete Sampras and you have to play really well against him 
                    to beat him. You have to stay focused because you know that 
                    if you are not there on the court he will beat you very easy. 
                    He is very tough so we have to respect him.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You said Youzhny is the biggest star in Russia: I thought 
                    the biggest star in Russia was Kournikova?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. No, Youzhny is first.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Why?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. Well, just I know he is very good this guy. I practise 
                    with him and basically we grew up in the same club - Kournikova, 
                    Youzhny and me - so we have a very good club in Moscow and 
                    he is doing well. He is a hard worker and I think he has a 
                    great future because he is quite professional and he has a 
                    very good guy training with him and they are doing well and 
                    he will be really, really tough in the future. I think this 
                    year he will do well, he will be in the top 20.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Who is the guy you are hitting with that you said? At the 
                    beginning you said you were practising with some guy?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. That is another one.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Who is the guy who is your coach or who is here with you?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. My coach?<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. The guy who is here with you?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. Amit Naor, he was my manager before, he is, I don't know, 
                    coach, manager; everything together.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. With the top five seeds disappearing from this tournament, 
                    after being out on court a couple of times is there anything 
                    about the conditions, the court, anything at all that you 
                    can help explain this exodus of the top players?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. I don't know. I can't explain. I think they didn't have 
                    enough time to rest or to prepare themselves, I think this 
                    may be the main reason, because everybody who played the Masters 
                    they are out, basically - Kuerten, Hewitt, Grosjean, Kafelnikov 
                    - everybody who were in the semi-finals in the Masters. Ferreira 
                    didn't even come here, he was injured already in Spain. So 
                    I think the reason is that they didn't have enough time to 
                    rest. Maybe that is the reason, I'm not sure.<br>

                    Q. As someone who enjoys their vacations, would you like to 
                    have the tournament shifted back a bit? Would you like the 
                    tournament to be pushed back so that people could - - -?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. No, no, I'm satisfied. I finished the year perfect. I finished 
                    the year at the beginning of November, I had enough time to 
                    rest, to go for vacations, to enjoy my life, and enough time 
                    to get ready for this year, to make a great preparation physically, 
                    mentally, and just enough time.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. And in between matches off the court is there anything 
                    that you are doing this year different to last year, anything 
                    at all? Are you spending your time just in the way of keeping 
                    focused on things?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. I am not doing anything at all.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Really?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. Nothing. Zero.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What do you like doing when you come here?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. I don't know. I have too much energy. I don't know, too 
                    many things I have in my head, so maybe that's why I have 
                    never played well here because, you know, many things.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. No restaurants, no - - -?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. No, of course I go to restaurants, but I take it very easy. 
                    I have my friends around and we stay at home, we watch tennis, 
                    we learn how to play tennis, just take it easy. I think that's 
                    the main thing. So the less things you have in your head, 
                    the better you play. You have to be just relaxed and enjoy 
                    your moment, enjoy your victories, and get prepared for the 
                    next match.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Do you ever reflect on what happened two years ago here 
                    in the first round when you were fined?<br>
                    <br>
                    A. Shit happens, you know. What can I say? It happens. I'm 
                    really sorry, and I think also they probably make a little 
                    bit big scandal out of this out, I think. Nobody were watching 
                    this match even, you know, and it was a bit depressing. But 
                    it was okay. I got fined, yes; I didn't play my best tennis, 
                    but it was two years ago, and I'm a different guy, a different 
                    player, and I'm ready to win this year, I think.<br>
