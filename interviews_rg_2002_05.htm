                    Marat Safin - S. Grosjean 6-3, 6-2, 6-2<br>
                    </b></font></p>
                  <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. 
                  Did you expect it to be so easy? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: It's never easy, especially -- I mean, especially 
                    today. But I played quite well. I played smart. And I was 
                    focused. I tried to stay calm, tried to play my game. And 
                    I was holding during the match. There was a breakpoint in 
                    the third set, but I could manage to just to finish the match 
                    in three sets, otherwise it could be very difficult. <br>
<br>
Q. Is this as well as you would like to play? You would like 
                    to play better? You're happy with your game? How do you feel?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: You're never satisfied with your game. You never 
                    can be satisfied. You always try to look for better game and 
                    try to, you know, serve better, you try to volley better, 
                    try to play from the baseline. But I think it's a quite good 
                    quality of the game. I think it's good enough to be in the 
                    semifinals and to have a chance, you know, to get into the 
                    finals. I think if I manage to stay like this - focused, and 
                    try to play my game - I think I have a chance. <br>
<br>
Q. How about compared to how you felt Saturday in Dusseldorf 
                    when your back was hurting you? You must be pretty pleased. 
                 <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: It was a difficult week for me because I lost 
                    to Kiefer, I couldn't even finish the match against Acasuso. 
                    I was playing without any confidence. I was quite lost in 
                    my game. But then suddenly I came here and I start to play 
                    each day better and better. I was feeling great in the court 
                    yesterday. And today I was quite -- no, very good. Even me, 
                    I was impressed with my game (smiling).<br>
<br>
Q. How does it feel to be here with three Spanish players 
                    now?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No, just you have to give also opportunity to 
                    other players, not just from Spain. For me, it's an honor 
                    to be in the semifinals and to have -- to still to fight to 
                    win this tournament. It's going to be difficult. The Spanish, 
                    they are always tough on clay. They are playing well. But 
                    I think I'm good enough and I think I have enough game to 
                    at least to try to beat them. And I think -- I'm looking forward. 
                    I would love to try myself tomorrow, try to make it into the 
                    finals. Why not? <br>
<br>
Q. Because of your own story, you have special connections 
                    with Spain. Does it make it special?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: &quot;Special&quot;? Maybe, I don't know. I 
                    don't know if it's special or not. But I know them quite well. 
                    I know the way they play. They are the biggest fighters in 
                    the world. They have very good baseline, very focused. They 
                    never miss a shot. But the match where you have to look for 
                    a game and try to put under pressure - I mean, in this case 
                    Ferrero - and try to serve well. You definitely need a good 
                    serve, try to look for the net, try to stay with him, try 
                    to stay calm.<br>
<br>
Q. So you think the serve will be one of the keys of the 
                    match against Ferrero? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I think that's enough, you know, just to serve 
                    well, you know, try to do something on his serve, like not 
                    to play his game, because his game is quite good. He plays 
                    very well from the baseline. You need to do something else. 
                    You need to go to the net, try to do something. You need to 
                    do something against these kind of players.<br>
<br>
Q. How would you describe all those years you spent in Spain? 
                    What kind of memories do you have?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: The best memories, I think, thanks to -- thanks 
                    to Spain, I'm here. Thanks to my first coach, that he was 
                    with me since I was 14 up to 2000. I mean, they gave me everything. 
                    I learn how to play on clay. It's where I took my first points, 
                    ATP points. I feel great, you know, that I have such a great 
                    school, like Spanish school. I think it's the most difficult 
                    one. You have to be really tough to be able to pass it. And 
                    they treat me very well. All the Spanish players, they've 
                    been treating me very well, they've been nice to me. If I 
                    will try to find something bad about Spanish, I mean, it's 
                    difficult. They treat me well. I can't say nothing about them. 
                    But also I know them very well, the way they play, the way 
                    they think. And I think it's good for me - I mean, for the 
                    match of tomorrow.<br>
<br>
Q. Is there any part of your personality that is &quot;Spanish&quot; 
                    in a way? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: The way I'm playing on clay?<br>
<br>
Q. No, your personality.<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I don't know. I grew up in Spain. Maybe I have 
                    some things from Spain. I think it's not bad. I think it's 
                    good. <br>
<br>
Q. Do you still have contacts with Rafael? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yes, I have. And he's doing well. He opened 
                    academy. He's doing well. He has a big family. He has to take 
                    care of the kids, try to make some money, and live his relaxed 
                    life. I'm really proud of him. I have to say thanks to him. 
                    I mean, every day I have to say thanks to him because he was 
                    the only one who actually believed in me. And it was an extraordinary 
                    man for me. And I think it's great. It was a great six years 
                    together. We are still friends. Also he became more than a 
                    coach. He became actually my second brother or maybe father. 
                    He knew me very good. I mean, great relationship. <br>
<br>
Q. A couple things, you didn't play too well in the semifinal 
                    in Australia against Haas at the beginning of the match. You 
                    didn't play too well against Johansson at the end of the match. 
                    Did you learn things from that now that you're down to the 
                    final rounds here?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No, because it was different story. Against 
                    Johansson, it's difficult. Not many people, they understand 
                    that Johansson is very dangerous player, very dangerous player. 
                    He won Montreal I think two, three years ago. He's very solid 
                    tennis player. He has a great serve that you can't even read 
                    it, great return, great baseline. You know, he can play from 
                    the volley. This day, he was just better than me. I was maybe 
                    a little bit under pressure, was a little bit nervous, I couldn't 
                    find my game. But that's it. But still, it was four sets. 
                    He won 7-6 in the fourth. Okay, I didn't play probably my 
                    best game. But this day he was better. You cannot judge me. 
                    I mean, I tried. I tried hard. You cannot not try in the finals, 
                    especially if you are there, you have to try. And I did it, 
                    but just I wasn't good enough this day. But I think it's a 
                    different story. I learned from this a lot. And I think it's 
                    -- I hope it's going to work this time - if I will get there.<br>
<br>
Q. You beat Ferrero three times in very important matches 
                    in the past. Do you think it can give you an advantage?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I think so. I think so. I know him also since 
                    we are 13 basically, playing together at European championships. 
                    I know his game, he knows my game. I always play well against 
                    him. I like his game. I feel comfortable against him. <br>
