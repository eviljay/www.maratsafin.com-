                  Associated Press<br>
                  Friday, January 25 <br>
                  <br>
                  MELBOURNE, Australia -- A cooling rainstorm was just what Marat 
                  Safin needed.<br>
                  <br>
                  Saying, &quot;I had no chance to win if it didn't rain,&quot; 
                  Safin took advantage of a 50-minute delay in the Australian 
                  Open semifinals Friday, winning 11 of the final 13 games against 
                  Tommy Haas to advance to the final against Thomas Johansson.<br>
<br>
                    The 2000 U.S. Open champion, whose 22nd birthday coincides 
                    with the final, was trailing the seventh-seeded Haas two sets 
                    to one when rain forced the suspension.<br>
<br>
                    With the roof of Rod Laver Arena closed and the temperature 
                    dropping from 95 degrees to 75, Safin used his booming serve 
                    the last two sets to win 6-7 (5), 7-6 (4), 3-6, 6-0, 6-2.<br>
<br>
                    &quot;Thank God it started to rain,&quot; said Safin, who 
                    was leading 1-0 in the fourth set when the rain came. &quot;I 
                    needed the break and God gave it to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
                    The semifinal lasted 4 hours, 28 minutes, including the interruption. 
                    Safin's quarterfinal victory over Wayne Ferreira lasted just 
                    28 minutes before the veteran South African quit with an abdominal 
                    strain while trailing 5-2.<br>
<br>
                    The Russian admits he doesn't like the heat. He held both 
                    arms up in triumph when the semifinal was suspended.<br>
<br>
                    &quot;I didn't make any miracles,&quot; Safin said. &quot;I 
                    just didn't give him any chance after the break. I made the 
                    break (of serve) straight away, because he wasn't warm enough. 
                    I took this chance and I started to serve better and I started 
                    to return -- I changed completely the game.&quot;<br>
<br>
Haas agreed that the rain delay made all the difference.<br>
<br>
&quot;He picked up his game,&quot; Haas said of Safin. &quot;The 
                    roof was closed, it was a bit more like an indoor game. It 
                    just didn't go my way.<br>
<br>
                    &quot;Mentally, I was totally there, (but) my legs weren't 
                    there anymore. Once you're a step late to a shot, you're not 
                    going to make them.&quot;<br>
<br>
                    Added Haas, &quot;I don't think the break helped me much. 
                    I had to start all over again and he came out on fire. That's 
                    just the way it is.&quot;<br>
<br>
                    It was a good omen for Safin, who also got the benefit of 
                    rain during his winning run at the U.S. Open two years ago. 
                    He won the opening two sets of his third-round match against 
                    Sebastien Grosjean, but wilted in the heat as the Frenchman 
                    rallied to even it at two sets apiece.<br>
<br>
                    He used a rain break then to shower and change socks, then 
                    returned to oust Grosjean and went on to take the title.<br>
<br>
                    Before the break Friday, Safin needed a medical timeout for 
                    cramping and heat stress. He later needed treatment for blisters 
                    on his hands.<br>
<br>
                    In the first set tiebreaker, a forehand volley miss that left 
                    Safin trailing 4-6. Haas then won it with a backhand down 
                    the line.<br>
<br>
                    Repeating the sequence of the first set, Haas broke first 
                    in the second and then was broken back.<br>
<br>
                    In the second, two double-faults by the German helped Safin 
                    make it 3-3. The ninth-seeded Russian gained a 5-3 lead in 
                    the tiebreaker with two winners and cashed in his second set 
                    point with a heavy serve.<br>
<br>
                    Haas saved a break point at 2-2 in the third set with a diving 
                    forehand drop volley that left him sprawling over the Rebound 
                    Ace hardcourt. He gained the key break for 4-2 by saving two 
                    game points with backhand winners. He clinched it when Safin 
                    sent a forehand return long.<br>
<br>
                    Safin got a massage and changed his socks during the rain 
                    delay. After the restart, he conceded just 11 points in the 
                    fourth set, including five after he earned three set points 
                    at 0-40 in the sixth game.<br>
<br>
                    He won his opening serve in the fifth set before Haas held 
                    serve to snap a seven-game losing streak.<br>
<br>
                    But the German dropped his next service game to fall behind 
                    3-1, and never caught up.<br>
<br>
                    Safin, meanwhile, improved his serve game and fired his 17th 
                    and 18th aces at 135 mph and 134 mph as he took a 4-1 lead.<br>
<br>
                    He clinched it on a double-fault by Haas, whose best previous 
                    result at a Grand Slam event was a semifinal appearance here 
                    three years ago.<br>
<br>
                    Safin returned from a back injury last year to make the quarterfinals 
                    at Wimbledon and the semifinals at the U.S. Open, where he 
                    lost to Pete Sampras. He reversed that loss to Sampras here.<br>
<br>
                    The former world's No. 1 player had a 6-2, 6-4, 6-7 (5), 7-6 
                    (8) victory over Sampras, a 13-time Grand Slam event winner, 
                    in the fourth round to assume the favorite's role for the 
                    Australian Open.<br>
<br>
                    Johansson, seeded 16th, made an unexpected run to his first 
                    Grand Slam final and benefited from a men's draw that was 
                    devoid of stars because of injuries and upsets.<br>
<br>
                    The Swede, who described himself in a news conference as &quot;not 
                    very interesting&quot;, met only two seeded players en route 
                    to the final. He beat No. 21 Younes El Aynaoui in the third 
                    round and No. 26 Jiri Novak in the semis. Novak never previously 
                    advanced beyond the fourth round at a Grand Slam.<br>
<br>
                    The 26-year-old Swede, who has won six ATP tour events in 
                    eight years and had a career-high ranking of 14, admitted 
                    he was almost shaking as it took him four match points to 
                    seal his spot in the championship match.<br>
<br>
                    He was helped by upsets in his half of the draw, which included 
                    No. 2 Gustavo Kuerten, No. 4 Yevgeny Kafelnikov, No. 5 Sebastien 
                    Grosjean, No. 6 Tim Henman and Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic.
