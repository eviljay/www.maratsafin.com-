                  An interview with: MARAT SAFIN</b><br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. What is the difference in your mind between, like, now and 
                  the weeks before? Did you feel the difference in confidence, 
                  when you're on the court? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but also, you know, I had bad luck in Lyon. 
                  I lost to Kuerten 7?6 in the third, which is how I started to 
                  play well.<br>
                  Then I lost and didn't play really well in St. Petersburg.<br>
                  But lately I was getting good results; I was making quarterfinals. 
                  Because before, like until US Open, I couldn't make even the 
                  second round. I was playing terrible. I didn't play well.<br>
                  Then lately I was, you know, slowly I was getting into good 
                  shape. Now just I was nothing to lose; I was ?? I'm already 
                  in Shanghai. <br>
                  So that's why, you know, just feeling better. I have no pressure, 
                  and the confidence is coming back.<br>
                  Also, luck is on my side this week.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Do you feel that when it comes to crucial points you think 
                  less now, you just go for it? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. Just that's my thing. My tennis actually 
                  is a lot of risk. But when you have no confidence, it's difficult 
                  to push yourself to play down the line on important points.<br>
                  So now I'm playing and I'm doing the things in the right moment 
                  and right way. And everything is just going inside the court. 
                  Just that's make the difference, you know, to play important 
                  points down the line or just go to the net and not be afraid.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Do you have the feeling that you play nearly as well as in 
                  2000 when you won here and the US Open? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. I'm playing much better. Much better.<br>
                  I'm feeling good. I'm playing well, you know. Just confidence. 
                  Finally I got my confidence back. In 2000, I played just ?? 
                  yeah, maybe, I'm playing like two years ago here. Played really 
                  well. <br>
                  I was looking for that game for a long time. Now finally I found. 
                  I hope I can play this way for during another couple of weeks, 
                  so will be enough for Shanghai and for Davis Cup. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. He didn't have any breakpoint against you. That must have 
                  been a long time, no? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Also I'm serving well. I work on my serve, just 
                  make some corrections on my serve, you know. Just trying to 
                  go, you know, just to do something else. Just serving, just 
                  move a little bit around the court ? with serve out wide, serve 
                  to the body, go for the T, you know. Topspin slice, you know, 
                  just to make ?? to feel the opponent little bit, you know ?? 
                  just to make him nervous. <br>
                  If you serve all the time, same serve, same power, you get used 
                  to it. So I need to change the speed and the pace of the ball, 
                  and then it's much more difficult to return ? even if the serve 
                  is not going really fast. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Do you feel that for yourself and Yevgeny to be playing here, 
                  in the same arena that you'll play in for the Davis Cup, it's 
                  been an advantage for you two this week?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: No, everybody knows it's going to be completely 
                  different. But it's just a different surface. The public will 
                  be completely different. Everybody will cheer for France.<br>
                  But anyway, just getting used to this stadium, it's a good week 
                  to, you know, to practice and to feel the crowd, feel the, you 
                  know, the court a little bit, you know, the size of the court. 
                  Then on clay, just it's a different story.<br>
                  But anyway, it will be easy. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. How much does it affect you to have the crowd environment 
                  when they're cheering the opposition? Does it spur you on, or 
                  do you find that it can unnerve you a bit? How do you react 
                  to that? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: If the public is against me? <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Yes. Or for the other person. <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but it's normal. I mean, in Russia, I have 
                  everybody with me. Here, I have most of the people against me. 
                  That's life. <br>
                  Especially on Davis Cup, it's completely different story. It's 
                  a team sport. We're playing against France in France. What do 
                  you expect? You don't expect anybody to cheer for you. <br>
                  That's why you have to be mentally prepared and also physically. 
                  Because if mentally, you're little bit tired of tennis because 
                  it's end of the season, so at least if you have a good fitness 
                  conditions, at least you can run and can save the match with 
                  your legs.<br>
                  It's also is a good thing.<br>
                  Then if you are physically well, then it helps also mentally, 
                  you know. I think we need to work on it next few weeks, physical 
                  conditions. Because clay, end of the season and everybody is 
                  tired, so you need to be strong enough. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. It will be your third final tomorrow. Do you think it will 
                  help you tomorrow?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I hope the third one will be mine. I lost a couple 
                  of them this year. I lost in Australia. Unfortunately, I lost 
                  in Hamburg. Now, at least in Paris, I always play well here. 
                  So I hope that luck will be on my side that time. I need to 
                  win at least one tournament this year; otherwise, it's just 
                  not so good.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Will Yevgeny actually retire if you win the Davis Cup? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: That is the question without any answer. I cannot 
                  give you the answer. He says yes, but, you know, he has like 
                  seven Fridays in a week. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. We don't know obviously who you're going to play in the final 
                  yet. Could you just give us a couple words on each one of them 
                  and what they bring to the table for you?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Shall we start from the No. 1? Lleyton is playing 
                  great. He had a beautiful season. He won the second Grand Slam 
                  title. He won Indian Wells and he won other tournaments, I don't 
                  remember which ones.<br>
                  But still he's No. 1 in the world. I don't think that nobody 
                  can take him out of there. Just you have to play your match 
                  and you have to do the thing, you have to risk. He will not 
                  give you any presents. But also he doesn't make any winners, 
                  he doesn't kill you. <br>
                  You have to be consistent, try to be tough on the court, not 
                  give up. And just fight for it. Whatever comes, comes, you know?<br>
                  Also have an opportunity to lose that match, but still, you 
                  know, it depend on you.<br>
                  Against Srichaphan, he started this year like 110, 114. Now 
                  he's in Top 20 and he's getting closer to Top 10. He's really 
                  powerful guy, big serve. A lot of power on both sides. He's 
                  full of confidence.<br>
                  But he never was in the final of a big tournaments. So maybe 
                  it would make the difference. I hope so. <br>
