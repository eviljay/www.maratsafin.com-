                  Marat Safin - Lleyton Hewitt (AUS) 4-6, 6-2, 4-6<br>
                  An interview with: MARAT SAFIN</b><br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: You played very well towards the end of the first 
                  set, the second set and the beginning of the third; then what 
                  happened? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Nothing happened, I just ?? I had my opportunity, 
                  but then I start to little bit rush and I lost a little bit. 
                  I lost a couple of points and just ?? I should have ?? I didn't 
                  finish a few points, actually, and that was my mistake and then 
                  just he played well. But otherwise, you know, if I would go 
                  3?0 in the third set, I think the match would be mine because 
                  I started to play well, I started to be confident on the court, 
                  but then just again it happens. <br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: You know Lleyton very well. You beat him last week; 
                  he beat you this week. What makes him the No. 1 in the world 
                  for the second year in a row? What's his big strength? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Consistence, nothing else, just dedication, consistence 
                  and nothing else. He has the same shots like everybody, he has 
                  ?? I would not say like he has unbelievable ground strokes. 
                  I can't say that he has unbelievable serve. I can't say that 
                  he has unbelievable volley. He's fast, yeah, but there's other 
                  people are fast, but right you said, mentally strong and consistence. 
                  That's what makes the difference between ?? from other players, 
                  because I think some other players who can play much better 
                  tennis, but they can't make it ?? I cannot talk for myself, 
                  but we cannot make it for this kind of players, they cannot 
                  play the whole time like this, for some reasons, nobody is perfect, 
                  but so that's why Lleyton is No. 1.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: What do you do from now up to the Davis Cup final 
                  and are you ready for Fabric Santoro? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: For Santoro, I'm not sure he's playing, but in 
                  everything is the part of the joke and the rest is truth, you 
                  know? But definitely I will have to just ?? I will take a few 
                  days off because I had a tough week. Doesn't matter how confident 
                  you are, but just losing three matches on basically your surface, 
                  it's tough, and so just few days off, you know, forget about 
                  tennis, so you be ambitious again and you'll be motivated again 
                  and start to be able to start to practice again, prepare yourself 
                  for Davis Cup. So I think because the game I have, I can see 
                  that I don't have any unbelievable mistakes that I have to work 
                  on. I can volley. I can play from the baseline. I have a serve. 
                  But still, you know, like there's some things that you need, 
                  I think. I need a few days off and afterwards I would need a 
                  long vacation to forget about this year and just to be able 
                  to start the new year with another motivation and just to be 
                  able to fight again and travel again for 11 months and win tournaments 
                  and win matches week after week.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: Your sister Dinara has had an excellent year. Firstly, 
                  do you think that she has the potential to be a top 10 one day? 
                  Secondly, could you envisage a situation where you might team 
                  up for mixed doubles in a slam, maybe the Australian Open 2003?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I think she has done really good year for 16 years 
                  old girl. I think it's really good and, for sure, for sure, 
                  she has the potential to be there, to be in top 10, but you 
                  never know, when you are 16 years old is like ?? take Hingis. 
                  You have to look for many players. She was the greatest player 
                  ever and everybody thought that she going to stay No. 1 for 
                  the rest of her career, but suddenly there came Serena Williams, 
                  Venus Williams and right now she's taking a lot of times off. 
                  She lost the motivation. She lost the game. She doesn't ?? she 
                  has something that ?? she needs to find something to be able 
                  to come back and be able to play big tournaments and for me, 
                  it's very important. I mean, for her is very important to stay, 
                  you know, to play tennis, enjoy the life and it would be better 
                  for her because she's only 16 years old and she has a long way 
                  to go and has a long career and you don't have to rush.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: And the mixed? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I'm getting old, she's too young, so it doesn't 
                  work, you know, not yet.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: We too, like you, are ready for the Davis Cup finals. 
                  So if you can give me an answer about between you and Kafelnikov, 
                  if you are close friends and if you are colleagues and then 
                  if you remember where you were watching the Davis Cup final 
                  that Russia lost.<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I'll answer if we are friends with Kafelnikov or 
                  not. I would not say that we are closest friends because, first 
                  of all, I have different ?? I have difference in age and we're 
                  completely different persons ?? completely. We're not, you know, 
                  we don't have anything in common. Yes, his own friends, I have 
                  my own friends, but when I have to play Davis Cup, when I have 
                  team matches, we stay together in the and it's working, you 
                  know, it's ?? we are business partners, colleagues we can say. 
                  And I was preparing myself in Spain to become a player, both 
                  finals, 1994, 1995. I didn't saw the finals. I was there, but 
                  I didn't have the Russian TV ?? couldn't afford it.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: It's a long season. You look tired, particularly you've 
                  had to play a lot of matches with Davis Cup. I'm wondering if 
                  you think that like the Ryder Cup in golf, that Davis Cup should 
                  be staggered, played every other year as opposed to the format 
                  it is now.<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: How was it before? Like Ryder Cup.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: Or do you think it should be played every year like 
                  it is now? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I think it's a good question. It's a good idea, 
                  actually, because as you can see, that we're travelling for 
                  11 months a year and if you're in the finals of Davis Cup, you 
                  don't have ?? you finish ?? basically you finish 1 December, 
                  right, and you have to fly to Australia and I mean if playing 
                  first tournament of the year is starting on 26 December, I mean 
                  there is no time for rest, there is no time for preparation. 
                  So basically they destroy the preparation because you need to 
                  prepare yourself for the big tournament like Australia for a 
                  new season. You need to be fit, otherwise you can get injured. 
                  So which is you have I think the ATP, they should do something. 
                  They should take care of the players because I think it's a 
                  good idea, you know, to make it or to make the Davis Cup a little 
                  bit earlier so we have time, you know, so we need time to rest. 
                  We cannot just play tennis. We're not machines here. We're not 
                  robots. We have also ?? I need to be with my family. I didn't 
                  see my family since four months. Can you believe it? And when 
                  I'm going to see? I'm going to see three days in France for 
                  Davis Cup and then I have to go for vacations. I want to rest, 
                  you know.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: So you think it's a good idea? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: That's great idea, I think. You know, is good idea, 
                  but idea stays idea. It has to become something, right? The 
                  idea is great.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: I have watched you lose your games and I think one 
                  of your advantage on the court is going to the net and volley, 
                  but this time in the Masters Cup final, I think especially in 
                  your match against Costa, you have lost lots of points by going 
                  to the net. Is that because you are too eager to win or you 
                  are not confident enough?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: For where to start. I think just the court is a 
                  little bit too slow for me and I didn't get used to it and because 
                  I played in Paris where I got used to the Paris court, it was 
                  a little bit faster, the bounce was low, so any good shot that 
                  you make basically is a winner and here every shot you make, 
                  you know, is coming back and it's like ?? that's why the first 
                  two matches, if you don't take the match from today because 
                  today I played much better, I think, compared. Okay, I lost 
                  the match, but still I had my chance. I could have ?? I should 
                  have won, that's my mistake. That's okay, you know, but it happens. 
                  But in the first two matches, I didn't ?? I couldn't ?? I didn't 
                  finish the point, you know, I thought the point is finished, 
                  but it wasn't finished. That's why and I was getting by surprised 
                  every time I was going to the net. I didn't wait for the answer 
                  from other players, from Costa and Moya.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: You're very charismatic player, but you lost three 
                  matches in a row. Will you come back to Shanghai? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Thanks a lot, but if you make the Masters next 
                  year, yeah, why not? <br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: Will you leave Shanghai earlier now? When are you 
                  leaving? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I have to go to see my parents. I'm missing them. 
                  I'm flying tomorrow. I have to fly tomorrow to see my parents 
                  before I'm going to prepare myself for the Davis Cup.<br>

                  QUESTION: You like to hit the ball and kick the ball on court, 
                  you know. You exhibit good soccer skills. Is that a way you 
                  make yourself relaxed on court?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: No, I just sometimes to do something different, 
                  because you get bored of so much tennis, so you do something 
                  different on the court, something more exciting than tennis.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: (Interpreted from Spanish): The question was about 
                  Moya and Costa, the match, and he answered that he doesn't think 
                  that there's going to be any kind of arrangement in that respect 
                  for the other players. They wouldn't do any kind of arrangement 
                  and the best man anyway will win the tournament and he's out 
                  of the tournament anyway, so he doesn't really care that much, 
                  but he doesn't believe ?? he says they're both very well mannered 
                  and well educated players and for respect for the players, he 
                  doesn't see any kind of arrangement among themselves. <br>
