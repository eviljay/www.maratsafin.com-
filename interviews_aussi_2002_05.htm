                    Q. Marat, what did you do during the rain delay?<br>
<br>
A. I tried to recover because, I couldn't feel my legs, I 
                    couldn't move them at the beginning of the match because of 
                    the heat, because of many reasons, and I was just - thanks 
                    God it started to rain, and then I had an opportunity to make 
                    massage and all these things and take care of my legs, and 
                    it worked.<br>
<br>
Q. You came out of that like Superman coming out of a phone 
                    booth.<br>
<br>
A. I think it was a tactic of my coach and his friend, they 
                    told me - they explained to me very simply what I have to 
                    do and I just - I did it. I didn't make any miracles in this 
                    match, I just had to stay there and just go better on the 
                    return; and that's it, that's what I did. I started to return 
                    the serve, I started to read better the serve, and yeah, I 
                    did exactly what they said. So it was good, it was good.
					<br>
Q. Does it remind you of the match against Grosjean in the 
                    US Open, or is it completely different?<br>
<br>
A. No, it is completely different, because there the rain 
                    delay was like just two points, two or three points, and here 
                    I was losing two sets to one down, and Tommy was playing great 
                    and I couldn't - just I couldn't do anything because I couldn't 
                    move and I couldn't run. I had no reaction in the legs and 
                    I was late all the time on the point. He was all the time 
                    pushing me from the back, and then I just changed the game 
                    completely. It was 6-0, 6-2, and I think I played great. I 
                    served well and I did the right things.<br>
<br>
Q. Do you think that that break also affected Tommy's rhythm?<br>
<br>
A. Yes, I think so, because maybe he started to think, you 
                    know - I don't know what he had in his mind, because I didn't 
                    give him any chance, you know, after the break, and I made 
                    a break straightaway because he wasn't warm enough, Tommy, 
                    he didn't serve well and he couldn't - and there was a low 
                    percentage of his first serves, and I took this chance. Then 
                    I started to serve better and I started to return, and that's 
                    it, and changed completely the game.<br>
<br>
Q. If it doesn't rain, do you lose?<br>
<br>
A. Yes. I think I had no chance, no chance. I couldn't - 
                    I had no chance to win if he stays and it doesn't rain. I 
                    think I had very small chance to beat him. I need that break, 
                    and I'm glad he gave me.<br>
<br>
Q. Before the rain, how important was the second set tiebreak, 
                    0-3 down and then six points winning in a row?<br>
<br>
A. It was important that I won the second set, so at least 
                    was a fight there, you know, and he had to play better and 
                    better, and then in the third set I had the break chance and 
                    I couldn't make it and I was losing all the time. I knew it 
                    and he knew it, that I had no chance to beat him because he 
                    played well, and I couldn't do anything against this. Then 
                    just suddenly it changed completely, the game. I was pushing 
                    him from the back and I was dominating completely on the court 
                    in the fourth and the fifth set. It was just - it was great, 
                    I think; I'm satisfied with my game.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, another hot day expected for Sunday - 35 degrees. 
                    How confident are you now of getting a bit of practice in?<br>
<br>
A. I hope it will rain again. No, but I will try to prepare 
                    because I think maybe at least I made a mistake and I will 
                    not do this again. That's it.<br>
<br>
Q. Can you tell us what that mistake was, Marat?<br>
<br>
A. No, I can't; sorry.<br>
<br>
Q. Was it not enough fluids?<br>
<br>
A. No, it was just my thoughts, and I just spoke with my 
                    doctor; that's it. I think it just was a misunderstanding 
                    and it was just a small mistake that we did, and that's it. 
                    But for the next match, I will be perfect.<br>
<br>
Q. Who gave you the coaching advice?<br>
<br>
A. Amit Naor and his friend.<br>
<br>
Q. What was the injury time out for, because I thought you 
                    were not supposed to have an injury time out for massage?<br>
<br>
A. Why not? Why not? If you are injured or if you have something 
                    bothering you, you can call the doctor, it says in the rules.<br>
<br>
Q. Anything?<br>
<br>
A. Yes, they bother me, my legs. I couldn't - that's why 
                    we have the doctor, that's why we have the masseur from ATP, 
                    if somebody have something that doesn't work or something 
                    is going wrong with the body, we are allowed to bring him 
                    on court, and he helped me a little bit. He made me small 
                    massage, he put me hot cream and tried to do something to 
                    make a reaction in my muscles, because I couldn't run. I just 
                    had no power in my legs.<br>
<br>
Q. What did he give you; vitamins?<br>
<br>
A. Vitamins, simple vitamins, and just hot cream.<br>
<br>
Q. Did the German player somehow surprise you this afternoon?<br>
<br>
A. No, but he is improved a lot from last time we played, 
                    and he is a more solid player. He is serving well and he has 
                    a very solid baseline. That's the main thing, I think. He 
                    has improved a lot, that's why he is in the Top 10. He is 
                    doing well; he's in the semi-finals here, and he played great 
                    matches, and he is a tough guy.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, could you be more specific about - was it something 
                    you did do before the match you shouldn't have, or something 
                    you didn't do?<br>
<br>
A. No, nothing, just with myself, I make a mistake, that's 
                    it. It is not - I don't want to - I can't explain to you, 
                    because it is just - - -<br>
<br>
Q. A big mistake, if you can't run for three hours?<br>
<br>
A. Yes, it is my mistake.<br>
<br>
Q. What did you do? Can I put you on the spot?<br>
<br>
A. I cannot tell you, my friend, sorry. It is a secret. I 
                    cannot tell. Tell me the reason why I have to tell you?<br>
<br>
Q. Well, I was just fairly are curious, that's all?<br>
<br>
A. I told you, I wish I could tell. For me, it is not a problem, 
                    but just - no, just no, I can't.<br>
<br>
Q. Did you have intravenous drip of fluids or something during 
                    the break? How were your fluids out there?<br>
<br>
A. It was perfect. I drink - I don't know how many litres 
                    of water and how many litres of vitamins. It wasn't a problem 
                    with the vitamins that I took, you know, the drinks. It wasn't 
                    the drinks.<br>
<br>
Q. You must have been quite shocked, the fact that you had 
                    only played seven games since Monday evening and when you 
                    go out there, you couldn't run?<br>
<br>
A. I couldn't run; it happens. It happens, and it happens 
                    when you are making mistakes. So it was a perfect example 
                    that you have to be careful. <br>
<br>
Q. You have the big entourage watching you now; have you 
                    been partying hard, is that it, and you need a rest?<br>
<br>
A. Me, partying? I wish. I wish I can party and I wish I 
                    can go one day out, you know, because there are some people, 
                    they talk too much. Before the match, or third round, I think, 
                    they said on the TV that I have been out until 6 o'clock in 
                    the morning, which is - I wish I can do it, you know, and 
                    I wish I can do it and then afterwards I can win the match. 
                    So I'm not going out, I'm quite professional, I'm going to 
                    bed at the right time, and that's it, I'm doing well.<br>
<br>
Q. Is soccer your second-best sport, because you show greater 
                    skills with the ball?<br>
<br>
A. I have to improve my soccer game, so I have a great time.<br>
<br>
Q. With such a victory, what are you most happy about with 
                    your game?<br>
<br>
A. That finally I could find my game and I was fighting. 
                    I was there, you know, I had no chance, and even then I stayed 
                    and I could find my game again. In the fourth and the fifth 
                    set I was playing perfectly. So it's very good, it's very 
                    positive for me to find my game at the right time, at the 
                    right moment.<br>
<br>
Q. Did you watch the Johansson and Novak match? What do you 
                    think about Johansson?<br>
<br>
A. No, I didn't watch the match, actually, I was busy. I 
                    was watching the movie.<br>
<br>
Q. You were in the dressing room, so you hydrated a lot, 
                    took vitamins and rested?<br>
<br>
A. No; massage - very important.<br>
<br>
Q. Massage?<br>
<br>
A. Yes, which just helped me a lot. I think the massage was 
                    the main thing.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, do you think now, beating Tommy Haas, with talking 
                    about the new generation coming, do you think you have made 
                    a big step now being one of the what they are calling the 
                    new bones and all that, you have made a huge step with this 
                    match?<br>
<br>
A. Thank you. We have to do something, otherwise tennis will 
                    die, so we need more and more new guys - Federer and all these 
                    guys are doing something, they are improving, and we need 
                    a little bit of time also. It can't go faster than it is going, 
                    we need time, we need to find our game so then people will 
                    start to know us and tennis will grow up again into a big 
                    sport. <br>
<br>
Q. That quarter-final, do you think it is a fair condition 
                    that you had to play today in very high heat and the other 
                    semis wasn't - the day before it was under other conditions?<br>
<br>
A. I think it is fair. You have to play and these are the 
                    conditions. It's still hard, I know, but he is also playing, 
                    he is also running and coping with 33 degrees, and he is suffering 
                    also. But he was better prepared than me for this match, but 
                    then we started playing indoors.<br>
<br>
Q. The other semi was the day before?<br>
<br>
A. That's okay, that's no drama. I don't have anything against 
                    this. I think I have enough time, you know, to recover from 
                    this and just have one day. That's enough. I'm 21 years old 
                    and I can recover in one day. I will continue when I'm going 
                    to be 27.<br>
<br>
Q. What are your thoughts about Johansson as a player?<br>
<br>
A. He's a great player. I think he's a great player; he has 
                    a great serve and he has a very good baseline, so you have 
                    to stay there, you have to fight a lot and just take your 
                    chances. That is the main thing; there are no other options.<br>
<br>
Q. Is he the type of player you like to play against?<br>
<br>
A. No, definitely, nobody likes to play against him because 
                    he is a very complete tennis player. He has everything: he 
                    has a great serve, great return, great baseline, and he can 
                    play from the volley. So he is a Top 20 and he is going to 
                    be Top 10, I think, right now, and he deserves it. He is a 
                    very respectable player.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, in terms of breaking racquets, are you more calm 
                    than you used to be? Do you have fewer broken racquets now?<br>
<br>
A. I have two in this tournament, so I'm getting better.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, there is no Swedish press here despite they have 
                    a finalist; but there is no Russian journalist here?<br>
<br>
A. I know.<br>
<br>
Q. How is the tennis rating in Russia now? Why is it that 
                    the press doesn't follow tennis very much?<br>
<br>
A. Because we have better things to do, I think. No, we have 
                    TV over here, but also it's a long way and I don't think that 
                    many journalists like to fly to Australia. It's 27 hours so 
                    the Russians, they prefer to stay in Moscow. It's a great 
                    city.<br>
<br>
Q. How about tennis popularity in Russia?<br>
<br>
A. It's growing. Slowly it's growing, and we're doing well, 
                    you know. We have new guys coming - we have Youzhny, we have 
                    Davidenko, we have Stalyov, we have all these kind of players 
                    who are doing well, and we have very good juniors. I think 
                    tennis in Russia is getting better each time.<br>
<br>
Q. Have you heard something about the Masters Cup next year?<br>
<br>
A. Yes, I wish; it will great for us Russians, it will be 
                    perfect.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, last year in Bologna Yevgeny was questioning a 
                    little bit how professional you were. Now he says you are 
                    quite professional. What was the difference in this eight 
                    months?<br>
<br>
A. Really? Kafelnikov? I think he is most - he knows everything. 
                    I think it is difficult, you know, to argue with him, so if 
                    he says that I'm more professional, then that's true.<br>
<br>
Q. Last year he was questioning your professionalism.<br>
<br>
A. What do you mean?<br>
<br>
Q. He meant you were not quite professional?<br>
<br>
A. I think he should take care of his life, and he has to 
                    be more professional than he is right now also, and he is 
                    28 years old. But still, that's my life; I love my life, I 
                    like to enjoy it and I'm doing well, as you can see, so it's 
                    working. But Kafelnikov, of course, is always right, so it's 
                    okay. It's good.<br>
<br>
Q. I noticed earlier both of you had ice packs around your 
                    neck and you had a kind of a stressful - I was on that side 
                    and you had a kind of stressful look on your face, but after 
                    you returned you won the first four games, you looked the 
                    same you did when I watched you at the US Open, like you was 
                    focused?<br>
<br>
A. It was important for me after the locker room just to 
                    show that I am still there and I'm not dead and I'm going 
                    to fight, and just to show the first two games that I want 
                    to win, and that's it.<br>
<br>
Q. After the fourth game, what ran through your mind after 
                    the fourth game?<br>
<br>
A. Just you have to keep going, and doesn't let him find 
                    his game, and he didn't. He couldn't find it, you know, he 
                    couldn't find it in the fourth set and he couldn't make it 
                    even in the fifth. I didn't let him, just I played a little 
                    bit different. I tried to be focused, tried to not get pissed 
                    with myself and all these things, and just play against him 
                    and whatever comes, comes. And I was lucky also that I make 
                    the early break in the fourth and it gives me a lot of confidence.<br>
<br>
Q. You weren't lucky; it was skill you had.<br>
<br>
A. I was lucky; believe me. No, I was lucky. Thank you.<br>
