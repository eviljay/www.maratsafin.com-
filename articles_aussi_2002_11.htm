                  Safin outclassed, but says he'll 'enjoy the moment'<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Sunday, 27 January, 2002<br>
                  MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Marat Safin didn't get the birthday 
                  present he wanted. <br>
                  <br>
                  The Russian, who turned 22 on the same day he played in his 
                  second Grand Slam final, lost Sunday to Thomas Johansson, a 
                  player five years his senior who said at the trophy ceremony 
                  that he was &quot;almost over the hill.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  But at the Australian Open, ninth-seeded Safin was the favorite, 
                  not the talented upstart with nothing to lose who trounced Pete 
                  Sampras in the final of the U.S. Open in 2000. <br>
                  <br>
                  This time, Johansson, seeded 16, was the underdog who had never 
                  won a Grand Slam and was &quot;on fire,&quot; in Safin's words.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I couldn't do anything. That happens,&quot; Safin said 
                  after losing 3-6, 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (4). &quot;He was too good, 
                  he played great. I tried to find my game but I couldn't.&quot; 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin was coming off a five-set victory over Tommy Haas in the 
                  and had one less off day between the semifinals and final.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Maybe I had a little bit more advantage because I had 
                  two days off and he had a really, really tough match against 
                  Haas,&quot; said Johansson, who improved 3-1 lifetime against 
                  Safin. &quot;I saw in the third set that Marat was really tired 
                  and in the beginning of the fourth, too, I had some chances 
                  to go up 3-love, double break. But after that, I think he was 
                  playing really well. He was hitting his serve a lot harder than 
                  he did before but I saw he was tired.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I think I didn't play my best tennis, definitely,&quot; 
                  Marat Safin said. &quot;I didn't make anything special to win 
                  today and Johansson was too good. He played great. I just tried 
                  to find my game but I couldn't.&quot;<br>
                  Backed by a bevy of buxom, blonde beauties in his box, Safin 
                  broke serve in the third and ninth game and saved all six break 
                  points he faced to take the first set in 33 minutes.<br>
                  <br>
                  History appeared to be on the Russian's side as he was 39-0 
                  in Grand Slams when winning the first set. But Johansson, playing 
                  in his first career major final but cheered on by vocal group 
                  of Swedes in blue and yellow face paint, settled down in the 
                  second.<br>
                  <br>
                  After making 12 unforced errors in the first set, he committed 
                  just nine in the second, hitting 14 winners.<br>
                  &quot;I won the first set and then had just stay calm and try 
                  to play. But I couldn't find my game and lost my serve very 
                  easily,&quot; Safin said. &quot;I didn't feel comfortable on 
                  the court today. I tried to do something but my baseline (game) 
                  didn't work at all.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  The Swede capitalized on the first double-fault of the match 
                  to take a 2-1 lead in the second. After dropping his serve for 
                  the first time, Safin broke his racquet on the changeover. He 
                  had two break points in the next game, but Johansson hit an 
                  ace and Safin put a backhand into the net.<br>
                  <br>
                  Johansson later served out the set in the 10th game, hitting 
                  a pair of aces and two service winners to level the match.<br>
                  &quot;In the second set when he made a break, it changed completely 
                  the game and I couldn't come back,&quot; Safin said. &quot;He 
                  started to play well and was dominating all the time.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;He was overpowering me from the baseline, which is very 
                  unusual for me. That somebody is playing a much better backhand 
                  than me. That's just how it was and I lost the second set.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Using an effective drop shot, surprisingly dominant serve and 
                  a punishing backhand, Johansson started to frustrate his more 
                  powerful rival. Safin dropped his serve in the seventh game, 
                  hitting two unforced errors and a double-fault on break point.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I think I was hitting my backhand really well today,&quot; 
                  Johansson said. &quot;I was really confident. As soon as the 
                  ball came on my backhand, I felt good. Sometimes I hit it as 
                  hard as I could and that's a great feeling to have.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Johansson had another break point in the ninth game, when Safin 
                  was jeered for appearing to tank. But the Swede showed the first 
                  signs of anxiety and failed to capitalize. However, he did not 
                  falter a game later, easily serving out the set in 43 minutes.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin competed better in the fourth set but could not crack 
                  the Swede. He lost his serve to begin the tiebreaker and an 
                  unforced error put the former world No. 1 in an 0-3 hole.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I never had a chance to come back,&quot; Safin said. &quot;He 
                  played great and did all the things he could do. I gave everything 
                  today and he was just playing great. He was on fire.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Johansson fired a crosscourt backhand passing shot for a winner 
                  and put a return of a serve at 125 miles per hour serve at the 
                  feet of Safin, whose half-volley on the baseline went long.<br>
                  <br>
                  The ninth-seeded Russian pulled within 1-5 when a backhand hit 
                  the net cord, went over his charging opponent and in. But Johansson 
                  hit a service winner to reach match point.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin saved three with a cross-court forehand drive, a service 
                  winner and Johansson's wide backhand. However, the match ended 
                  when Safin's lob attempt went long. Johansson, with a look of 
                  disbelief on his face, celebrated only with a few waves and 
                  a kiss to the crowd.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;When I saw the lob going out, that was when I knew I played 
                  unbelievable in the tiebreak, but having 6-1 against such a 
                  good player as Safin, anything can happen,&quot; he said. &quot;My 
                  legs started to shake again, so it was tough. But when I had 
                  6-1, I knew I had a really, really good chance.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Even when I tried to come back in the fourth set, I couldn't 
                  do anything,&quot; Safin said. &quot;That just happens. I'm 
                  a little bit disappointed but you have to accept these things 
                  as they are.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin didn't live up to expectations after his win at Flushing 
                  Meadows, and had an up-and-down season in 2001. But he was stellar 
                  in Melbourne, beating Sampras in a tight four-setter in the 
                  fourth round and Tommy Haas in five sets in the semifinal. <br>
                  <br>
                  He was outclassed by Johansson, who was hitting better backhands 
                  than Safin, a player renowned for that particular shot. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;He was overpowering me from the baseline,&quot; Safin 
                  said. &quot;It's very unusual for me, somebody playing the backhand 
                  better than me.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  At 6-foot-4, Safin is five inches taller than the Swede. <br>
                  <br>
                  But Safin's shotmaking didn't match his physique, and he said 
                  that at times he felt &quot;foolish&quot; because he couldn't 
                  make a dent in his opponent's game. Perhaps recognizing that 
                  he was simply being outplayed, he was subdued and kept a tight 
                  rein on his volatile temper. <br>
                  <br>
                  He was also gracious in defeat, praising Johansson before the 
                  center court crowd of 15,000 when he picked up his silver plate. 
                  He even paid tribute to the raucous band of Swedish fans, who 
                  were dressed in blue and yellow, their national colors. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Safin, we love you,&quot; they chanted in response. They 
                  also sang &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; to the Russian, and many 
                  in the stadium joined the chorus. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;You have to enjoy the moment. It doesn't happen very often,&quot; 
                  Safin said of reaching the final. Speaking at a post-match news 
                  conference, he said: &quot;It's my birthday, actually, nobody 
                  forget this. It's a small thing you have to enjoy.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  Tournament organizers brought a big, chocolate-coated birthday 
                  cake into the news conference. Safin blew out the single candle, 
                  and plucked a strawberry from the top and popped it into his 
                  mouth. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;So at least I have this present. Thank you,&quot; he said.<br>
                  <br>
                  Despite failing to join Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras and Yevgeny 
                  Kafelnikov as the only active players to win a Grand Slam at 
                  two different venues, Safin showed this week the form that brought 
                  him seven titles and a stay at the top of the rankings in 2000.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin planned to fly back to Moscow on Monday to train for Russia's 
                  Davis Cup tie against Switzerland next month. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I have to go back, do my job again and start from the 
                  beginning,&quot; he said. <br>
