He wasn't able to schedule a meeting since Marat had to go to the training room, but I waited for two hours by the exit and I asked Marat for a picture for the website and he did it. It is attached.

<P>I won the ticket to Hamburg Rothenbaum and it was my first match I could see<BR>live. He came on court and the whole atmosphere was changed. He play very<BR>hard, precise and very fast. After 50 minutes he had balls to win the <BR>match. I jumped to the croud who wanted signification of him and I got one.<BR>I was so happy about it. It was first time I saw him and I could be so<BR>clouse to him. I really couldn't believe it. I hold my hand over my head and<BR>took a picture of him. I didn't know whether it will be a good one, but it<BR>is a very good pic. After that I went outside and I wait for him. I and some<BR>others had luck Peter came out and after a cuple of minutes he came out wiht<BR>an other gay, who I don't know, and he was very relaxed and nice to us. He<BR>signed my backpac. I gave that man my camera and he took a beatiful picture<BR>of me and Marat. But after developing pictures I saw that he took more pics<BR>because there were some pics I couldn't take. He took 3 pics where Marat and<BR>me on them. I was very nice surprised. He talked to us&nbsp; for a short time and<BR>then he went to the cars. It was one of the best moments I could have. Thank<BR>you Webby and of cause thank you very much Marat for these unforgetable<BR>moments. <BR><BR>Djamila Bessert (Juli) winner at Hamburg<BR>Please Note<BR>These photos are the property of Djamila - please do not post elsewhere without her permission</P></TD></TR>

I was there too.<BR>We saw his singles which he won 6/0 7/5 against Lee. Marat was obviously the best. I was impressed by his game.<BR>Then Amit told us that we could see Marat before the doubles. We saw the matches of Federer and Moya. It was late so Adeline should leave and she wasn't there when Amit said to me that I only could see him after the double. Peter and him gave me tickets for my parents and my sister (thanks a lot to them) so we see the double in his box. He lost but it was so great as he made the game so much entertaining ( he threw his racket, was speaking a lot).</FONT></SPAN></P>
