<TD colSpan=4><STRONG>Report from ticket winner Atjanaporn Suwantarathip (ayodia) and her photos<BR><BR></STRONG><FONT face="Courier New">Date : 26-Sep-06 <BR>I arrived at the stadium at 2:00 PM and looking forward to seeing Marat 1st double match at 4:00 in court 1.There were a lot of his fans (mostly girls) sitting and his opponents came in and suddenly everyone looked for Marat and Feliciano Lopez. <BR>We were afraid that Marat would have withdrawn and at that time Feliciano stepped into the court and some of us relieved. <BR>Marat came into the court with his bright smile and new short haircut, my heart was beating since it was the first time that I saw him closely. <BR>They played quite well, took control of this match and won 6:2, 6:4 <BR>After his match, he also joined the official opening ceremony with serving the ball to the fans but unfortunately I couldn’t catch it. <BR>My friend asked me to see Marat at the transportation area where Marat had to get on his van, firstly I felt reluctant because I didn’t want to disturb his privacy but finally we were there during the rain, there were a few fans waiting once he was out, I ran to him and asked for his autograph. While he was signing I told him I was the winner from his website, he nodded his head and I said I had not got the ticket yet then Amit asked for my contact number. <BR>Late at night, the contact person called me to collect the ticket by 11:00 AM tomorrow. <BR><BR><BR>Date : 27-Sep-06 <BR>I collected the ticket at 11:00 am and Marat single match VS Kevin Kim was not before 04:30 PM, I sat in the grandstand which pretty good to see Marat’s appearance but it’s hard sometime to watch the game. Marat started not so well, he hit the ball a little bit too hard and could not find his rhythm yet, in the 3rd game he changed his racket but it couldn’t help much so Kevin took the 1st set 6:2. All his fans continued support him, I shouted loudly “come on Marat” both Russian and English. Once he got frustrated, we always clapped to cheer him up… and it worked in the coming sets. First time I heard his scream, I was scared but it would be a best way to relieve his pressure. <BR>In the 2nd set, he got used to the court, started playing well again and easily won 6-1. Last set, he broke 2 games and Kim took it back one, but Marat held his serve afterward then he took this set 6:4. Well done Marat !!! <BR><BR>Date: 28-Sep-06 <BR>2nd round Marat VS Julien Beneteau <BR>Since Baghdatis withdrew, Julien Beneteau had to compete with the lucky loser from Japan in the first round and he beat 6:4, 6:2 <BR>Marat approached to the net quite badly and could not lob as far as he intended to so Julien had many beautiful smashes.The first set was full of excitement and finally Marat won in tie break 7-6(5) <BR>There was a very long deuce in the 2nd game of the 2nd set, both of the players held their serves so deciding by the tiebreak again and Marat lost 6:7(3) <BR>In the 3rd set, Marat broke 2 times and didn’t make easy mistakes and closed his match by ace 6-2. <BR>Good job Marat !! <BR><BR>Date: 29-Sep-06 <BR>Quarter Final Marat Safin VS Mischa Zverev <BR>Mischa defeated Juan Carlos Ferrero and Rainer Schuettler in the 1st and 2nd respectively <BR>Mischa created many incredible shots and he played as if he was not the qualifier so it was painful to see Marat struggling and it was a survival test for Marat as well. <BR>Marat missed his first serves in the opening set and he was so upset, screamed and hit the tennis ball as far as he can in the 5th game. <BR>After falling behind 5:4, Marat broke back to 5:5 and in the 11th game he tried to hit the ball but he fell and lay for a while. By inspiring from his fans, he rose and continued his game until the tiebreak.&nbsp; Mischa got a mini break but Marat took it back to 4:3 and won 7:4. <BR>In the 2nd set, Marat got 3 break points in the 11th game but didn’t make it, followed by making a double fault on his serve so he slipped this set 5:7 <BR>Last set, Marat started throwing his racket and he would have done it many times, Marat got one break point in the 11th game and this time he didn’t miss it. <BR>Even he made the double fault on the last game but he grabbed the win 7:5. <BR>Keep going Marat !!!! <BR><BR><BR>Date: 30-Sep-06 <BR>Semi Final Marat Safin VS James Blake <BR>It was a big match actually and everyone was looking for it. <BR>Luckily I was sitting among Marat fans so I cheered him as loud as I can. <BR>In the 1st set he got one break in the 3rd game and he played beautifully including a wonderful support from the crowd, he took this set 6:3. <BR>2nd set, Blake broke his 5th serving game and Marat was frustrated, he threw his racket, hit to the net then it was broken by his hand. Blake held his serve and took this set 6:4. It would have turned to a different story if Marat could have held his serve after he broke Blake serving in the 3rd game. Blake continued easy serving games then the magic happened when Marat broke back in the 12th game but it was not enough to help him win the tie breaker 7:6(3). <BR><BR>I felt like I was a heart-broken but this match was extremely magnificent and I think it was the best match of the tournament. <BR>Thank you Marat for everything, I can’t wait to see you again. <BR><BR>I am so sorry if my report is not much detailed but please enjoy reading it <BR><BR>Atjanaporn Suwantarathip (Kae) <BR>Ticket winner <BR>Thailand Open 2006 <BR><BR>P/S for the picture which my friends and I took with Marat, starting from me (wearing purple Marat T-Shirt), Evelyn &amp; April (from Philippines), P'A-Ngun, Oum, and P'Why.</FONT><BR></TD></TR>
