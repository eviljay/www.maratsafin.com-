                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>You've had some very close matches in the past with 
                  Hrbaty. Do you think that's the best he's played against you?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN</b>: I think he played very good today, and I 
                  just -- I wasn't -- I played, as you can see the unforced errors, 
                  I make a lot of unforced errors. I play very badly. And I played 
                  -- I didn't make him run, and that's -- you cannot play this 
                  way against this kind of guys. He was hitting the ball very 
                  hard. You have to move them a lot on the court, and I didn't 
                  -- actually, I didn't play today. It was something wrong with 
                  me, because I couldn't move and just too many mistakes. I just 
                  played very far from the baseline and I didn't make anything 
                  special to beat him. I think he played very solid and he played 
                  very good today, and, yeah, he deserves to win. I mean I playing 
                  this way, he is a good player also. I mean, I can't play this 
                  way being No. 1, being No. 2 in the world. This is not my tennis. 
                  That's a little bit, I think -- that's ridiculous today what 
                  I made on the court. It was little bit disaster.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> How do you explain you couldn't move?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I couldn't move because, I don't know. I 
                  was tired. My legs didn't -- just was -- I was very slow. Maybe 
                  -- I don't know what's wrong, what was going wrong there, but 
                  I couldn't see the ball. I couldn't see the game because normally 
                  when you are playing you can see the game, you can see where 
                  the opponent gonna go with the ball, I just -- I was running 
                  from one side to another one and just putting ball, trying to 
                  put the ball inside the court. It was in the middle of the court 
                  or it was out. I mean, you cannot play like this against this 
                  guys. You have to do something more.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Did you expect him to return over 200 kilometer serves?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I mean, it's like everything. If you serve 
                  and the guy doesn't move, of course he gonna return. Is nothing 
                  wrong with the speed of the serve. It's just if you don't move 
                  the other guy, you have no chance to beat him. That's why today 
                  I just -- I didn't move him at all. The guy, he wouldn't sweat. 
                  (Laughter.) I mean, it was -- the guy was playing very comfortable 
                  from the baseline because I was making all the work. I was running. 
                  I was making unforced errors. I mean, you cannot play -- that's 
                  not the game. I think he was much better than me today. I have 
                  to think what I have to do in the future because this -- it 
                  cannot go like this.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> How far can he go in the tournament?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> If he play against guys like Henman and 
                  Rafter, it's completely different game. Against Rafter, I don't 
                  think he's -- he gets confidence beating me, because I mean, 
                  he beat me today quite easy. And next round, he can play -- 
                  I think he can even play much better. But also a different game 
                  and I don't think he likes the guys who serves -- making serve 
                  and volley. It's -- he doesn't like this game. But you never 
                  know. He can play very good tennis anyway, and I think he make 
                  -- he can make some good results here.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Did you think about trying to play more serve and 
                  volley to try and break up his baseline game?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No, because I mean, didn't -- if you don't 
                  have confidence, you cannot play -- you cannot do anything with 
                  the ball. I had no confidence at all. I was playing from the 
                  baseline, which is my best game, and I just was afraid all the 
                  time. I was afraid to hit the ball. I was afraid to change the 
                  directions. I was afraid to, you know, because we don't have 
                  confidence, you know, you start to lose. And you start to feel 
                  that the guy, the opponent, is much better than you and you 
                  start to try to find something else. When you don't have confidence, 
                  you cannot play. I didn't make anything, absolutely nothing 
                  to beat him. Yeah, I had the chances; yeah, I was a break up 
                  in both sets. But is not the point. At least you have to make 
                  the minimum of your game to beat him. But that was, I think, 
                  many peoples see that -- I mean, it wasn't my game. I think 
                  I can play a little bit better.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Do you think you get some more confidence now before 
                  the Davis Cup match?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Davis Cup is completely different story. 
                  I mean, I'm not going to be scared because I'm not any more 
                  14 years old and I am not -- I'm trying not to, you know, get 
                  nervous in Davis Cup. If we lose, I mean it's bad luck. But 
                  we're gonna fight. Definitely I'm not gonna be scared of playing. 
                  I have two, three weeks to practice and I think I can find my 
                  game. And I have to make some physic because as you can see, 
                  I was -- I moved horrible today and I have to do something else 
                  to beat him.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Sandy Harwitt, do you think the difference between 
                  let's say yourself, where you are, and let's say Andre Agassi 
                  and Pete Sampras is that their experience, they've learned how 
                  to come out of a match today even if they're not playing well 
                  or have confidence, how to come through?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, but I had many matches like this. 
                  I was down and I won them. But I mean also the people like Andre 
                  and Pete Sampras, they lose these kind of matches. Sampras, 
                  he lost against me. (Laughter.) I mean, Agassi, he lost against 
                  me in five sets in Roland Garros. I mean, they also lose these 
                  kind of matches. I'm not the only one in this world who can 
                  lose against Hrbaty. It's also you have to give a little bit 
                  respect to Dominik. He played great, and I don't think -- you 
                  have to respect him. I couldn't change anything today. But nothing 
                  -- is not -- just it wasn't my day.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> You had an arrangement with Marinov (ph), a fellow 
                  who's with you this week, not really your coach. Does this result 
                  affect your thinking in terms of who might be coaching you for 
                  the rest of the year?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No, I mean, this match is not the end of 
                  the world. I'm not going to play now satellites and try to win 
                  to get some confidence. (Laughter.) I mean, yeah, it was disappointed. 
                  I was really, really angry. Just I have to lose sometimes also. 
                  You cannot win all the time, every tournament you have to play 
                  your best tennis and try to win it. Yeah, I was trying. I make 
                  everything what I make today, and it was a disaster actually, 
                  and that's it. It's over. I mean this tournament is over. But 
                  it's the beginning of the year.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Was he officially your coach?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No. He is not my coach. He was the guy that 
                  I called to come with me just to make me company and just to 
                  have fun with him.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> What did you say to Dominik after the match?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Good luck. What can I say more? Good luck, 
                  have fun.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>How frustrated were you out on the court today?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> You saw it, no?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Can you translate what your Russian fans were saying?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Trying to -- they tried to help me, but 
                  I mean how -- you want me to translate to you the Russian words?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Yeah.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Which is -- if I tell you what is mean exactly, 
                  you will say that's it? (Laughter.) I mean it's not -- you cannot 
                  translate it. It's like, &quot;Come on, come on, don't give 
                  up.&quot; It's not exactly that.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Try.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> You know a disk, from the hockey?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> A puck, hockey puck.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>So it was all the time like this. Right? 
                  You see the reaction.<br>
