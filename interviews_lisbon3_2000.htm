                    1 seed Marat Safin lost to No. 3 seed Pete Sampras on Friday 
                    at the Tennis Masters Cup.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    MODERATOR: Questions for Marat. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Pete said his defeat in the US Open played a big part in 
                    his preparations for the game. How did you go into the game 
                    today against Sampras?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I think I didn't play at all. I think it was, 
                    I don't know, I couldn't hold my serve. I couldn't pass him. 
                    Actually, I didn't do anything. Of course, he played very 
                    well. He had his serve. I'm not satisfied with my game because 
                    playing against guys like Pete, you have to, first of all, 
                    hold your serve like a normal player from the Top 10, not 
                    losing two serves in the second set. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Pete also hinted before you can become the world's No. 
                    1 player, there's obviously a lot of hard work and a lot to 
                    learn. Is that something you would agree with?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yes, I'm learning. That's why I'm here. I have 
                    to learn.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Given that you're so close to taking that No. 1 spot for 
                    the end of the year, did that have any influence at all? Were 
                    you at all nervous as a result of that? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: You think I was nervous today? The question is 
                    I didn't play. I think it's not only the things on the court, 
                    it's the things out of the court. I think everything together 
                    was a small disaster today. I didn't show anything today. 
                    I think the people are not satisfied with my game - me also. 
                    I hope I will change tomorrow.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. But were nerves any part of the reason for you not playing 
                    as well as you can do?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Nerves? I don't think that was the case. I think 
                    it was a little bit different things than nerves. Just very 
                    simple things. Just I couldn't do the most simple things today. 
                    That's why it was so easy, so fast, without any chances. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Do you think the loss of this match today will change your 
                    mood and your expectations, will harm your performance with 
                    Agassi's match tomorrow? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I'm sure if I'm going to play the same way like 
                    I played today, I have no chance at all because to play against 
                    the guys like Pete, like Andre, like probably all the Top 
                    10 guys, without holding any serves, just cannot play your 
                    game. You cannot win many points, many matches. Also if I'm 
                    fighting for No. 1, which is very important for me, for sure 
                    I cannot play like this. Is not the game which I know, which 
                    I played most of the time. I will have to think about what 
                    I'm going to do tomorrow. But the way I played today, I have 
                    no chance tomorrow at all. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How tired do you feel, not only after this week, but after 
                    the whole season?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I think mentally you get tired because after 
                    three weeks in a row, maybe once or twice I had one week off 
                    holidays. It's difficult to play like this all the year and 
                    hold the same concentration in your head, make a good tennis. 
                    I think I'm going to be okay for next year, but today I don't 
                    think that's the case. Sometimes it happens, just you have 
                    no chance, everything is going in the wrong direction, and 
                    everything just doesn't work. That was this day, nothing works 
                    at all. Every passing I made it was on his racquet or it was 
                    easy volley for him. All the time I wanted to pass him, it 
                    was a mistake, wrong side because if I playing online, he 
                    was already on the line, if I make cross-court, he was already 
                    on cross-court. I mean, that's why it's 6-2, 6-3, without 
                    completely any chances. Of course, I have to say that he played 
                    great game, great serve from the second serve, didn't give 
                    me many chances. But the chances I had, just make this. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Do you know the number of the racquets you broke today, 
                    throughout the year?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Two racquets, but is not the most important thing 
                    at the moment. I think just something, frustration, just when 
                    you feel that it is not working, it is not working. During 
                    50 minutes already is not working, you get really mad. It's 
                    not my game. Also every ball is a mistake. I didn't make only 
                    one right decision, only one in the whole match I make a passing 
                    shot. How can I beat Pete this way? No chance. Okay, is one 
                    set, you want to start the second set, maybe I have a chance. 
                    Second set is a break, no chance at all. Of course, you get 
                    mad. Finally you have to do something because everything is 
                    in your mind. It's difficult to play like this. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Was it your fault or was it Pete that was playing extremely 
                    well?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Okay, let's put another way. Yes, I know that 
                    Pete, he plays very good. But also I'm not the guy who is 
                    one thousand in the world. Sorry, but I'm fighting for No. 
                    1 in the world. I cannot do this mistakes, not because I'm 
                    a genius here, I'm the best in the world, just because I have 
                    enough experience, I make some good results this year, I won 
                    some tournaments, I won one Grand Slam title, I won a lot 
                    of things this year, and I have enough experience to show 
                    a good game and pass these kind of people, make passing shots. 
                    But when you can realize that you have no chance at all, you 
                    cannot pass him at all, not down the line, not cross-court, 
                    not lob, nothing. Just understand that you are making sometimes 
                    ridiculous. Of course, the guy, in this case Pete, he start 
                    to play better and better with more confidence. After, the 
                    result is there, 6-2, 6-2 (sic). After the match, you start 
                    to feel that really you have to think the way you play today, 
                    analyze the situation.<br>
