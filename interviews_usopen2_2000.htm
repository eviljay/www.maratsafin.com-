                    <b>THE MODERATOR:</b> Questions for Marat. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> You struggled a bit in the first two rounds. This 
                    one was going to five sets. You had time to reflect on it. 
                    Is there a sense that, "Okay, I can get down, but I can fight 
                    my way back," does this possibly put you in a good frame of 
                    mind going forward?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think it was, yeah, the second round also 
                    wasn't -- I didn't play my best game. And also like the first 
                    match, it was little bit tight. Second round was very tight. 
                    I mean five sets, and I didn't even know that I wasn't sure 
                    if I can win this match. I was already afraid in the fifth 
                    set because I didn't play actually so bad. I didn't play -- 
                    also I didn't play my game. I just try to put the ball inside 
                    the court, try to move, but too soft. So he was pushing under 
                    pressure all the time. He was hitting great the ball, it's 
                    not my game, I cannot play like this and I cannot win. On 
                    the fifth set, of course, I decide to hit. It was big difference. 
                    I was 4-1 up, I had opportunity to make 5-1, and unfortunately, 
                    I think he played some games he played very well and some 
                    games I wanted just to handle my serve, hold my serve, and 
                    try to win. Okay, so 6-3, I hold my serve and I can win. It 
                    was in this case 6-4. I mean in the game with 5-3, with my 
                    serve, the guy serve 132 miles per hour on the line. What 
                    can you do? Nothing. You just -- I think he played very good 
                    game. I didn't serve very good first two points. That's it. 
                    It was 5-4, you know, already I didn't know what to do because 
                    he played great. I was already little bit out of confidence. 
                    Actually, I start to risk a little bit, I make the mistake 
                    on 15-40, easy one on the net. I said, "Okay, I still have 
                    5-4, I can fight a little bit more, try to return first two 
                    service in 5-4. If I can have a chance, of course I have to 
                    risk. Otherwise, if it works, okay. If it doesn't work, okay. 
                    We still have time to hold your serve and put the pressure 
                    one more time on his serve." I just -- 5-4, he just serve. 
                    I return, was very fast. Was way -- wasn't big rallies. I 
                    played some good shots. He made two easy mistakes, and that's 
                    it. The match was gone. Also I couldn't -- he save five matchpoints 
                    or four, I think. I said to myself, "I think I am going to 
                    lose today, because there's no chance to beat him." I put 
                    twice on the -- how you say -- on the net, on the bottom, 
                    outside, white line.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Top of the line?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, top. Twice. I mean I said, "I think 
                    it's not my day, and I can lose." So I just fight. That's 
                    it. Nothing special. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Obviously you got upset at times during the match. 
                    Was it your game that was driving you crazy or was it his 
                    game that was making you crazy? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think both of them. Because he just 
                    played his game. I played too soft. And I wanted him make 
                    mistakes. I mean is not possible. And I just try to convince 
                    myself to play little bit more aggressive, just try to play 
                    little bit faster, try to make some new things. And finally, 
                    I was learn enough to change my game in the fifth set. I try 
                    to make the game a little bit faster because he's at his game 
                    definitely, to hit sometimes the ball, then line, go to the 
                    net. Something new because otherwise it's a pain in the ass 
                    playing like this. (Laughter.) He tries putting the ball inside 
                    the court, which is not your game. And for what? Like this, 
                    I would not win. So I just -- I have nothing to lose already. 
                    Five sets, it's a lottery. Somebody is making good shots, 
                    make some good returns. Like I said before, he can make easy 
                    break and that's it. The match is gone. So you have to risk. 
                    I took a risk, tried to play a little bit faster. That's it. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Having survived this, does this give you confidence 
                    and make you think, "I can go on and win this thing," or does 
                    it make you think, "I struggled with this guy, I'm having 
                    trouble here"?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> Normally, if I would play since the beginning 
                    like I played the fifth set, with little bit more confidence 
                    next time, I think I can play great tennis because it doesn't 
                    go anywhere, the shots. It's a question of be a little bit 
                    more patient and don't be scared, try to play point by point, 
                    and just fight and try to make -- try to play right tactically. 
                    It's very important. Because you can play with a guy wrong 
                    tactically and it's -- you're not gonna win. Even if you're 
                    100 times much better than him. If you play wrong, how you 
                    can beat him? If you only play 50 percent of your power, but 
                    you play right tactically, it's much easier. You have to be 
                    clever, match clever on the court. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Is it fair to say that you are easier to beat mentally 
                    than physically? And, if so, what do you need to do to overcome 
                    that? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b> MARAT SAFIN: </b>Nothing. Just I am a little bit fat. 
                    I can feel it. Of course you cannot feel I am still the -- 
                    I have the same body, but I don't know how, but I am five 
                    kilos more than normal. So you can -- it was tough to run 
                    with five kilos more. Also, you have to work a little bit. 
                    Tomorrow I have -- today, at home, I lost two kilos. Tomorrow 
                    I have time to lose another three. So you have to do it. Because 
                    it's very difficult to run. You get tired and it's very difficult 
                    to hold the concentration during the match. But if you're 
                    good physically, you can hold your concentration. I think 
                    if I can do it, I can play great tennis here. But it's little 
                    bit -- I need to work a little bit physically, which will 
                    help me to hold the concentration. Very simple.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>But you talked before about feeling at one point 
                    in the match, "I'm going to lose today." <br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think at the end it gave me already -- 
                    I didn't play so bad. I played better here also. But I think 
                    I am not saying to myself that, you know, it's how can I play 
                    five sets against Pozzi? He good player. He's clever enough, 
                    very clever guy, 35 years old, Jesus, hee must be clever. 
                    (Laughter. So I am satisfied with my fifth set. I'm really 
                    satisfied. Even when I was afraid, I played some great points 
                    and some good decisions and I played very good tactically. 
                    But of course when you're tired, it's difficult to hold it 
                    and it's difficult to run with five kilos more. Believe me. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>When you play against him, this player who at times 
                    I mean he slices it, takes so much off the ball, I think you 
                    actually serve twice as fast as him at one point. He got you 
                    with a 70-mile-an-hour second serve. Do you say to yourself, 
                    "I can't believe I'm going to lose to this guy," because of 
                    the softness and the touch? <br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, because you also -- he plays very soft. 
                    I know. But with his slices, you cannot attack because they 
                    are very low and you have to be -- it's difficult to attack 
                    on this -- on this shots. For me, it's impossible. I couldn't 
                    do anything. He just had to make the point first, and after 
                    when he make -- try to build the point backhand. Then the 
                    forehand because at least he can -- the ball bounce a little 
                    bit higher, because with a backhand, when he have the ball, 
                    it's difficult to do something special. So you have to make 
                    the point. You can't make unbelievable shots all over the 
                    court during three hours. You get crazy or it's unbelievable 
                    day if you make it. Because all the times, even three hours, 
                    with same concentration, make winners from this slice, you 
                    are a genius. But normally, you drive crazy. What is normally 
                    happens. But if you make it three hours, you make winners 
                    from his slice from the backhand, you're best player in the 
                    world. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>On your side of the draw there are a lot of very 
                    good players but not necessarily big name superstar players, 
                    no one who's won a Grand Slam. So when one of those players 
                    makes the final, even though it's going to be a good player, 
                    because the player is not Agassi or Sampras, they might say 
                    it's not going to be as big a marquee matchup as the women's, 
                    let's say. Do you think the only way that's going to change 
                    is if one of those players such as yourself or Corretja or 
                    someone like Norman wins a major? Or do you think that maybe 
                    fans should just become more sophisticated and realize that 
                    they're good? Do you see what I'm saying?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think first of all it doesn't matter 
                    who won the -- if Moya won in '98, Roland Garros, and Agassi 
                    won this year Australian, you can see he lost to Clement. 
                    I think there is another guys like Norman, like Kiefer, like 
                    Ferrero, they're great players. Norman, he lost in the Finals 
                    in Roland Garros, but it doesn't say anything because it's 
                    already in the past. It's this matter, it depends how they 
                    play, it depends how you play. And of course it's actually 
                    against Norman, against Ferrero, against Kiefer, it's the 
                    closest guy to me. They can play, they can even win here. 
                    They have a big opportunity, but the most experienced guy 
                    gonna beat him.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>But do you feel like -- you're right, Norman and 
                    Kiefer are great players. Do they have to win a Grand Slam, 
                    do you think, before they earn that right for the public to 
                    feel that they're great players?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>I think they can win. But it depends. 
                    Of course the public is -- they talk -- the public react only 
                    when they win the Grand Slam, the big tournament. Then they 
                    talk about how great he is, but they don't count how many 
                    tournaments, how many small tournaments, how many tournaments 
                    he won this year. He won five tournaments or four tournaments. 
                    I mean and also final in Roland Garros. But unfortunately, 
                    doesn't count. It counts only the Grand Slam tournaments. 
                    But I think it's difficult for us, it's completely different 
                    than for public. I mean Norman, for me, is huge. Kiefer is 
                    huge. Ferrero is huge. But of course, I mean for the moment, 
                    they play better than Andre I think, in better shape. But 
                    of course for the public it's much better Agassi. How you 
                    can compare Agassi to Norman? The public will say, "Right." 
                    But I think Norman is better, for the moment is better, much 
                    better than Andre. Even he doesn't win one Grand Slam. But 
                    it depends how you want to represent them to the public. It's 
                    one side. How you represent them to the public. And is another 
                    side how you represent them to the players. So it's little 
                    bit -- it's difficult to answer right on this question. For 
                    me, even the guys who never won the Grand Slam, for me, they 
                    are huge. More than maybe for the moment Pete or Andre, with 
                    all my respect. They are unbelievable players, but other guys 
                    who never won the Grand Slam, I think they are better than 
                    them. That's my opinion. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Ferrero just won in five sets. You have the same 
                    draw. Would you like to play him? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> If I have to, I will play. (Laughter.) 
                    But of course normally, we have to be there. Where I'm seeded, 
                    6th, he's 12th. We have a good opportunity to meet there. 
                    But we still have to pass one round each, and we'll see. If 
                    we play like both of us in five sets, I don't know what will 
                    happen in the next round. We have to play little bit better. 
                    We have to be little bit clever. If we meet, it will be great 
                    match. If we will have enough energy to make a great match. 
                    Otherwise, it's difficult to make our games without energy, 
                    because it's gonna be big rallies. I think we can make great 
                    match. Can be. But it can be also the worst one if we don't 
                    have energy to play. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>What is the role of Alexander during this tournament?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Just friend. He just carrying my bags, 
                    like friend. (Laughing.) <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>You were describing the other day that you are an 
                    emotional player. That's just who you are. When you have situations 
                    like today when there's some calls going against you and you're 
                    not able to dictate the match, do you think that those emotions 
                    can work against you and get you into a negative frame of 
                    mind? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Of course. But when it's happens once, 
                    is okay. Twice, you start to be little bit worried. Three 
                    times, you say, "Come on." Four times, you want to kill the 
                    guy. I mean you say to him, "Pay a little bit more attention 
                    on these bounces, please." I mean I came to him, said, "Come 
                    on, man, let's be little bit more concentrated." "Yes, yes, 
                    the machine doesn't work." What it mean, the machine doesn't 
                    work? The machine count. The ball is out, you have to call. 
                    So why you sitting there? No answer. I think it's five mistakes 
                    in one match, which can cost me probably easy $50,000 because 
                    of machine doesn't work, machine -- bounces on the serve. 
                    I don't understand this. Okay, you can make a few mistakes. 
                    But I mean very close ones. But if the ball is going like 
                    this out (indicating) three times, four times, sorry, I don't 
                    know. I don't understand this. Or you are not good enough, 
                    so why you sitting there? Or you pay a little bit more attention 
                    on the court when the players are there. I hope he will do 
                    it, the guys from the TV gonna show him how many mistakes 
                    he make in the match. Of course I went crazy because I am 
                    telling the ball is out. The guy, the linesmen also, they 
                    are watching me with a face like I'm stupid. And in this case, 
                    I mean first of all, if I am telling -- you think the ball 
                    is out, you can answer something. Human beings, we are not 
                    computer, linesmen, so please respect me; I respect you. If 
                    you make sorry, you know, I think for me is -- what can I 
                    do? I will hit him, no? Please respect me; I respect you. 
                    We are in the same business. With everybody on the court. 
                    So please answer the questions. What is -- I'm not gonna kill 
                    anybody. I'm just will tell him that, "Please, just little 
                    bit of attention more, hmm?" It's so easy, so simple. But 
                    when they look with me with the face like I'm stupid, it piss 
                    me off of course. Actually, when I'm right also. So is not 
                    right. I think so. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> And that obviously has an effect on the way you 
                    play subsequent points then? <br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> I was close, very close to break one racquet. 
                    And if I will break the racquet, of course who gonna say, 
                    "Violation, racquet abuse, Mr. Safin." Everybody knows this 
                    like, you know, they can be a genius. The chair umpires. But 
                    when they have to see the marks on the court, nobody -- he 
                    is not -- is business. But of course he is business when he 
                    call the violation. Everybody knows this. They have to pay 
                    a little bit more attention on these bounces. Sorry, sorry, 
                    sorry. Okay. What can I do? <br>
                    <br>
