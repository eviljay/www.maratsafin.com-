                  AN INTERVIEW WITH: MARAT SAFIN</b><br>
                  <br>
                  TOUR OFFICIAL: Marat fires 13 aces today. Moves into the round 
                  of 16. Will play the Rios-Moya winner for tomorrow. <br>
Questions for Marat. <br>
<br>
REPORTER: Hi Marat. First I have to ask you about the tiebreaker. 
                    There was a key point in the match and it was 3-3 when one 
                    of your serves hit Andre in the face and it seemed to hurt 
                    him a little, jar him a bit, and I'm wondering if you can 
                    describe that play because he had only one more point after 
                    that. <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No. I think it's 3-3. In a tiebreaker you basically 
                    need to serve first serve because it's very important and 
                    because if you serve to the side you have to serve way wide 
                    and, you know, at 3-3 you're a little bit nervous so just 
                    serve strong to the body and let's see what happened because 
                    it's very difficult to play it and -- I mean -- and I have even opportunities before the point. I 
                    had just easy ball, easy passing shot, and I made a lob, and 
                    I was making quite stupid mistakes but then -- I mean the 
                    serve saved my ass in the tiebreaker. It's different<br>
<br>
REPORTER: Marat, you were up about 5-Love in the first set. 
                    He then came on. Was it more something he did or was it something 
                    you didn't do? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Well actually nothing. Nothing -- nothing happened. 
                    He just -- he broke me but he was -- also I had like five 
                    set points and he was serving first and second serve like 
                    220 kilometers per hour. What do you want me to do? It's like 
                    good luck and I mean it's -- he played well. He served well. 
                    I can't say that I was doing something wrong and he made me 
                    break, yeah, of course because I made two double faults but 
                    I was playing okay. I was -- I was still under control and 
                    when I had the opportunity the second time that I served there 
                    -- like it's 5-3 -- I won it easy so it was okay. I wasn't 
                    -- I wasn't nervous at that moment. <br>
<br>
REPORTER: Marat, were you at all conscious of the  fact that you won the tournament here two years ago and he 
                    won the tournament in Montreal last year? It was sort of a 
                    battle of two champions of the tournament?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No because it's already history. Two years ago 
                    and one year ago, it's already in the past, so you're coming 
                    here to win it again and to win the tournament. You don't 
                    think that what happened last year and how he played last 
                    year. It is just you come here you want to win the tournament. 
                    It doesn't matter against who you're playing and just you 
                    go for it so it's no. It's a difficult match but not like 
                    -- without history. <br>
<br>
REPORTER: He played pretty well and he was really fighting 
                    pretty hard. Did you sense -- like maybe when you're defending 
                    champion you fight a little bit harder to win the title?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yeah but also I have to say it's Master series 
                    so there are lots of points, lot of money, so you have to 
                    fight anyway so but -- what was the question? I forget. <br>
<br>
REPORTER: Did he fight like a defending champion? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. Yeah. I think -- he played -- I played very good the first set and the second set he was 
                    -- he was playing great. He was serving well. He could -- 
                    he was playing with a lot of confidence and I was -- I was 
                    lucky, you know, that I served well on important points because 
                    he was playing -- he was great. He can -- he even start to 
                    make second volley and he can play from the baseline. He can 
                    play; he can serve well; he can return so he's a very dangerous 
                    player and in a tiebreaker it was very, very close and if 
                    I don't serve a few times first serve then it's a third set 
                    and then you never know. <br>
<br>
REPORTER: Marat, the way you're playing now do you feel that 
                    your level now is capable of winning this tournament or are 
                    you not prepared to look that far ahead yet?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No, no. I don't -- I don't look so far because 
                    I have tough opponent. Rios or Moya . They're both playing 
                    well. Moya - he won the tournament like two weeks ago I think 
                    -- I think. Yeah. Two in a row. I didn't know. And Rios is 
                    always dangerous. He's a lot of talent and I mean he can play 
                    a great match and he is always dangerous so just -- let's 
                    see what will happen tomorrow. I mean you have to -- you have 
                    to play that match and you have to work hard and then, then 
                    we can talk about winning a tournament. <br>
<br>
REPORTER: Marat, Moya, he won 13 matches in a row. You weren't 
                    following tennis? You don't know what's going on? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I told you I was on vacation so I'm not -- I 
                    wasn't at the office so I didn't -- I didn't know any results 
                    and just -- I didn't know who was even in the semifinals and 
                    the quarter finals in Wimbledon. Yeah. <br>
<br>
REPORTER: Good vacation! <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Very good. (Laughter) I need them. <br>
<br>
TOUR OFFICIAL: Anything else?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Thank you very much. <br>
