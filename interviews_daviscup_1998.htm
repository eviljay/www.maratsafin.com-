                    <b>1998 DAVIS CUP ATLANTA, GEORGIA<br>
                    RUSSIA vs. USA (FIRST ROUND) April 6, 1998<br>
                    M.Safin/J.Courier 6-0, 4-6, 6-4 , 1-6, 4-6<br>
                    United States-3, Russia-2 </b><br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> What in the world happened to you today? You played 
                    a hundred times better than the previous two days. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Because there was not too many media people 
                    from Russia's side (laughter). <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Congratulations on a great match. In the second 
                    set at 4-1, you seemed to be totally in control, dominating 
                    play. Courier went to a slice backhand. Did that seem to cause 
                    you a lot of problems? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Courier changed his tactics. I was not 
                    ready for it. Actually, I lost my concentration.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> How big a match was that for you?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> It's pretty difficult for me, all my muscles 
                    hurt. But it was great. I really enjoyed it. I didn't want 
                    to win so quickly; that's what I was doing, trying to extend 
                    my play (laughter).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> What was the difference in the match? Why did you 
                    lose?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Just I'm not so experienced as Courier.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Did you maybe only start to really play a little 
                    nervously in the fifth set? Was that about the only time it 
                    got to you, the pressure today? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>I think I was playing at the same level 
                    all the sets; just I lost my serve in the fifth set. That 
                    was kind of the problem for me. I lost my concentration. I 
                    was tired. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>What is your favorite surface? Do you enjoy hard 
                    court or clay?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Clay. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Is that because you train in Spain?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, I guess so. It's almost four years 
                    I am playing on the clay courts in Spain. And in Moscow, it's 
                    pretty close to Spain, same courts. But I did like the clay 
                    court today, I really did (laughter). <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>You fell in I think the fourth set, seem to have 
                    hurt your hand. Did you hurt your hand?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Nothing broke. I just lost half of my 
                    finger, but that's okay (laughter).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>CAPTAIN TARPICHEV:</b> I would like to congratulate the 
                    American team for such a great victory. You deserved it. Thanks 
                    a lot for the warmest reception that you provided to us.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> Thank you, very much, the Russian fans who 
                    attended this event today.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> What do you think was your main disadvantage in 
                    today's game? What did you miss today?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I just needed to be a little bit successful. 
                    I missed my success today. I lost my concentration, and I 
                    lost my serve in the fifth set. If I could win the second 
                    set, I would really have a great chance to win the game. I 
                    think if I could win the second set, it would be much easier 
                    for me to play further.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Have you been nervous compared to the previous game?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> It cannot get worse (laughter). And, plus, 
                    as I said, there were no Russian media people here, which 
                    is kind of helped me. Only two of you, but that's okay (laughter). 
                    I haven't seen Russian TV here probably. That also helped 
                    me. Now I realize that one representative from the Russian 
                    broadcasting company is here.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Where did you watch the match with Kafelnikov versus 
                    Agassi, here on the site or the hotel?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> At the second set I realized that Kafelnikov 
                    was going to win, and I just went for lunch (laughter). <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Who was accompanying you right before the game, 
                    before you went to the court?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I was with Mr. Tarpichev's son.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> And your plans for the nearest future tournaments, 
                    events?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Tonight I am flying to Napoli, Italy, 
                    and I'm going to play Challenger. Next week I'm going to play 
                    in Barcelona. <br>
                    <b><br>
                    Q. </b>Are you going to play the tournament in France?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yes, I will be playing. <br>
