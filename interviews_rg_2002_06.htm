                  <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. 
                  If on a scale of 1 to 100 you could rank your mental strength 
                  in this tournament, it was probably somewhere in the 90s for 
                  the first five matches. Where would you say it was for this 
                  match? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: No, it's just I think the guy was much better than 
                  me. I try to play, but I didn't -- I couldn't find my game. 
                  He was just too good. I think he was playing with a lot of confidence 
                  and he was serving well. He moved me around the court. I couldn't 
                  do actually much. That's why the score was 6-2, 6-3, 6-4. I 
                  tried, but I couldn't.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. So what happened in the past times when you beat Ferrero? 
                  What could you do then that you couldn't do today? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: No, I was -- I don't know. But today just I couldn't 
                  find my game. And when I had a break in the first set, but the 
                  guy, he played much better than before. And he has more experience 
                  now. He won two Super 9's -- two Masters Series events. He made 
                  already last year semifinals here. The guy, you know, he knows 
                  how to play. And he just -- he learned a lot. Now he's very 
                  dangerous. And he was just much better than me. I couldn't say 
                  that actually I played so bad. But just I couldn't find the 
                  solution to beat him.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. So do you think he will be the clear favorite for the final?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Who? <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Juan Carlos. <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I don't know, because Costa is playing well, also. 
                  He made results in the clay court season. He made quarterfinals 
                  of Monte-Carlo. He made finals in Barcelona. Then he made in 
                  Rome I think quarterfinals. He beat Ferrero in Hamburg. He's 
                  a dangerous player. But I think is going to be tough finals. 
                  And, I don't know, it's finals, so you never know who going 
                  to be the winner. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. What do you recall of your relationship with Juan Carlos 
                  when you were practicing together near Valencia?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: No, just I think all you can say. I don't know, 
                  he started a little bit later than me, you know, like one year 
                  later. But the guy, you know, he can play -- but he played completely 
                  different when he was a kid. I mean, he's hitting the ball - 
                  before he couldn't hit the ball, he was just making lobs all 
                  the time, he never missed the ball. But now the guy is attacking, 
                  he's serving well. He changed a lot since that I saw him first 
                  time when I was 14. So it's just pretty impressive how you can 
                  change your game.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Except Ferrero's game, do you know any other reason why you 
                  couldn't find your game? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Just, I don't know, I wasn't good enough today 
                  as I was. That's it. It's another day. You have to accept these 
                  things. You cannot play all the time your best tennis. Sometimes 
                  you're playing not great, you try, but you cannot find it. Of 
                  course, it's tough. But this life, it's how it is, that's sport. 
                  You have to, you know, be tough and just move over. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. What was the most missing in your game today? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I think the serve. I didn't serve really well. 
                  And just I was in the middle of the match, I was a little bit 
                  lost. You know, I didn't know what basically to do. And just 
                  I didn't feel really comfortable on the court, and I couldn't 
                  find the solution. That's why it was -- that's why the score 
                  6-2, 6-3, 6-4, it's quite easy. I couldn't find the solution, 
                  I couldn't find the game. It was very difficult for me. I tried 
                  just to stay closer to the baseline and just move him around. 
                  But the guy, he was everywhere, and he was playing with a lot 
                  of confidence. That's tough to beat the player which is playing 
                  really well - especially Ferrero, he's moving fast and has great 
                  shots. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. What happened in the last game? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I thought it was at 30-All (smiling). I was gone. 
                  I was too concentrated in the match (laughter). <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. On a similar note, you have missed a number of his service. 
                  How difficult was it to return and try to have the return ace 
                  on his serve? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Just one more time, a little bit louder.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. How difficult Ferrero's serve?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: How difficult was Ferrero's serve?<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Yes. How difficult was it for you to hit it back in order 
                  to get a return ace? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: The problem is not I think actually the serve, 
                  because you cannot just return the ball. You have to put it 
                  somewhere so he cannot attack. So basically you have to start 
                  the point without any, you know -- without giving advantage 
                  to Ferrero. Because if you serve, you have already advantage. 
                  But also if you just return the serve, and he's already with 
                  a forehand, he's just moving you around. So especially it's 
                  not a good solution. So you have to return that way. The guy, 
                  he has to start the point again. So basically you're in the 
                  same position. And then it starts the rally. It's a special 
                  tennis example. It's difficult to return when the guy has huge 
                  forehand and you know he will push you and will move you around 
                  the court. So then you are under pressure.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. In the second set, you were serving at 2-4, breakpoint against 
                  you. You hit a great serve into the corner of the ad side. He 
                  tossed up a very high lob. You went almost into the doubles 
                  alley. What happened there? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: What happened there? I think what happened, I don't 
                  think the ball was going out actually because he was going like 
                  this way. But you have to take a risk, you taking the ball or 
                  you just let it bounce. So I decided take a risk and just hit 
                  a smash. And that was a bad solution. But, I mean, at that moment 
                  I thought it was the right one.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Was it a good risk on breakpoint, on a ball that high? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I think everybody has own opinions about that. 
                  I think -- because otherwise with what you start? You restart 
                  the point, right? I don't want this, because I was already having 
                  advantage. I had a smash. Okay, I miss it. But if I don't miss 
                  it, then you will not ask me this question, right? Why you miss 
                  it? You have to ask the question, &quot;Why you miss this point?&quot; 
                  I will tell you. It's because the ball was too high and then 
                  it was too far away from the net and then is breakpoint. So 
                  you already have all these things on your mind. So that's why 
                  I miss. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Some people say he has two forehands. <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Huh? <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. You see what I mean? He has two powerful sides, no difference 
                  between the backhand and the forehand. He's able to hit both. 
                  What do you think about that?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Everybody has a weak points. Is almost impossible 
                  to have two the same shots, if any forehand and backhand. It 
                  doesn't exist in tennis, right? It never exist. It's just rules, 
                  it's written in the book. It's from the beginners. Okay, one 
                  day you can play better forehand, another day you can play a 
                  better backhand. He has a very good backhand, but he doesn't 
                  make so much that -- but he does a lot with the forehand. He 
                  opens the court very good with the forehand. But with the backhand, 
                  he's playing more straight. I think his forehand much better. 
                  But his backhand is solid. That's the problem. Is solid. Just 
                  doesn't make any mistakes. Doesn't go for too much. And that's 
                  why it looks so good. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. At one point near the end of the match, you had a pretty 
                  long conversation with your racquet. I know normally you're 
                  not so friendly to your racquets. I was wondering if it did 
                  any good?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: What answer are you looking for (smiling)? What 
                  answer you are looking for asking me this question? <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Are you usually more abusive to your racquet. This time you 
                  decided to be more gentle? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: When you are losing, two sets to love down, and 
                  you trying just to put a return or just put it back, the ball, 
                  deep, and you cannot make it, what a conversation you can have 
                  with the racquet or with yourself? What conversation you can 
                  have (laughter)? <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. That's what I want to ask you. <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I give you the answer, but I don't think is the 
                  right one. But still...I was pissed. As you can see, I think 
                  so. I was very disappointed, so I need to do something because 
                  it was going for too much already. I could explode. But then 
                  it's bad for the public. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. You have opportunities to get to the finals of Grand Slams 
                  at this point in your career, but the older you get, obviously 
                  the less they come. Are you aware that they are very rare? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: You have to look from other side also. You know, 
                  okay, like I'm 22, I made finals in Australia, I won the US 
                  Open two years ago, a long time ago. And I don't know if it 
                  will come. Yes, I was very close to be in the finals. Yes, I 
                  was close to win the tournament. But it's, you know, like from 
                  this point to be a winner in a Grand Slam, it's like from here 
                  to the moon. You know, you have to be tough, you have to play 
                  great, you have to be confident on the court. I didn't have 
                  all this points to be able to become a winner. And then, I don't 
                  know, I'm not sure that I'm going to be a winner one more time. 
                  Maybe yes, then it's great. If not, it's not a big deal. But 
                  just a sport which I am trying to enjoy myself every time I 
                  go to the court. Is difficult to do sometimes, like today. But, 
                  you know, I just want to play tennis. I want to enjoy it. If 
                  it will come, if I will become a Grand Slam winner again, I 
                  don't know, it would be a great moment in my life. But it's 
                  really, really difficult - as you can see. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Do you have a specific goal for this season? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. I have two Grand Slams left, so I will try 
                  to, I don't know, be solid. Maybe I have a chance this year. 
                  Of course, I think -- I'm already Grand Slam champion two years 
                  ago, finals I have, so I think I'm missing No. 1. If I will 
                  be able to stay solid this year, make my results, slowly without 
                  rushing anything, then maybe I will have this opportunity. It 
                  will be great. I think my goal is to become No. 1.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Do you foresee any decisions concerning coaches, or is it 
                  still a temporary situation?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I'll be honest. It's difficult to find the coach. 
                  I tell you what's reasons. First reason is that, you know, big 
                  players, big guys, they've been in Top 10, you know, they have 
                  families, the guys like over 30, right? So they have families. 
                  So it's difficult to have this guy for traveling for 42 weeks 
                  a year with you. It's very difficult. And on other hand is also 
                  that is difficult to find the coach who will understand your 
                  game, who will understand who you are, who you want to be, and 
                  what -- which way you want to play.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. You have to be Russian to understand your mentality?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yes. We've been watching different cartoons. You 
                  think this way. We've been watching different cartoons. We grew 
                  up in a different system than Europeans. So it's very difficult 
                  to the European people, to understand the Russian one. Nobody 
                  can actually understand Russians. It's difficult. You can, but 
                  it's difficult, right? I think it's easier to work with a Russian 
                  guy. He more or less understands what you need, he understands 
                  how you think, what is your game, and what you want to be, what 
                  you need for your game. Because like it's a different school. 
                  French school is one school, Spanish school is a different one. 
                  So it's not so easy to find the right guy who will be able to 
                  travel with you, you know, also to bring the results. Of course, 
                  I mean, for the moment I am doing well with Amit Naor. He's 
                  helping me a lot. For the moment I don't want to rush. It's 
                  slowly. It will come. I hope so. <br>
                  <br>
