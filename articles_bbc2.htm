                    BBC Sport Online's Peter Sanderson catches up with Russian 
                    baseline king Marat Safin to discuss tantrums, tactics and 
                    silverware. <br>
                    Marat Safin is living proof that the tennis world still has 
                    a few characters in its locker room. <br>
                    <br>
                    Whether he is swishing his racket in exasperation, trading 
                    insults with an innocent ball boy or collecting the latest 
                    in a growing catalogue of winner's cheques, you can be sure 
                    there will be fireworks on court when the world number three 
                    is in action. <br>
                    <br>
                    Big on personality and thankfully for his coach Mats Wilander, 
                    even bigger on talent, Safin aims to add spice to this year's 
                    All England Championship. <br>
                    <br>
                    More importantly, the Russian is anxious to add some silverware 
                    to the Safin mantlepiece.<br>
                    </font></p>
                  <p align="center"><img src="img3/safin_raq150.jpg" width="150" height="180"><br>
                    <i><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Safin: 
                    Plenty of spare rackets</font></i><br>
                  </p>
                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">Critics 
                    of Safin's style have bravely - some might say foolishly - 
                    already written off his chances of winning Wimbledon, claiming 
                    his game is more suited to life on the harder surfaces. <br>
                    <br>
                    His record on grass isn't brilliant, reaching only the last 
                    64 at Wimbledon last year - just weeks after beating Greg 
                    Rusedski at Queens Club. <br>
                    <br>
                    But the towering Russian is keen to prove his doubters wrong. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    He insists he is fond of the grass and maintains that his 
                    form is as good as ever with the Grand Slam less than a week 
                    away. <br>
                    <br>
                    He told BBC Sport Online: &quot;My game is great at the minute. 
                    Everything has been organised well by my coach and I have 
                    prepared myself well for Wimbledon. <br>

                  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
                    &quot;I have a good feeling about this year's championship. 
                    Contrary to reports I love playing on the grass and, after 
                    drawing a qualifier, I feel I can go well beyond the first 
                    round of the tournament. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;The Wimbledon crowd seem to like me so, hopefully, there 
                    will not be any need for me to lose my temper!&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    As well as earning him praise from John McEnroe and accumulating 
                    a supporters club almost as big as that of his favourite football 
                    team - Spartak Moscow, Safin's explosive temper on the court 
                    has forced his coach to discipline him. <br>
                    <br>
                    Last year he broke a phenomenal 48 rackets - nearly one a 
                    week - forcing Wilander to introduce a $100 penalty for every 
                    moment of madness.<br>
                    <br>
                    Fortunately, the amendments to his game have reaped spectacular 
                    reward, curbing his temper, bolstering his devastating serve 
                    and improving his sledgehammer backhand. <br>
                    <br>
                    This new blend of maturity and focus have given him renewed 
                    belief that he can beat the best players on the circuit - 
                    even on grass. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;I feel I can win Wimbledon,&quot; he admitted.<br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;People talk about the style of tennis you play being 
                    particularly important at Wimbledon and, unlike some, I think 
                    my game lends itself well to the conditions. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;I can do some damage with my serve and my backhand wins 
                    me a few points - there is no reason why I can't win there. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;All the men who have excelled at Wimbledon in the past 
                    few years will once again be a threat - it is no coincidence 
                    that Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras always seem to perform 
                    well. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Sampras' record speaks for itself and in an ideal world, 
                    you wouldn't have to cross his path until as late as possible 
                    in the tournament. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Agassi too is someone who seems to save his best tennis 
                    for the All England Club and, of course, he is in decent form 
                    coming into the event. <br>
                    <br>

                    &quot;No doubt all the serve and volley experts such as Tim 
                    Henman will be tough to get past - especially with Henman 
                    performing in front of his own crowd. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;And Pat Rafter is another top seed who can beat anyone 
                    on grass - this could well be his year but I would prefer 
                    it to be mine.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    Curiously, the game's premier tournament has been hit by a 
                    number of controversies before a ball has been hit in anger 
                    this year. <br>
                    <br>
                    Safin admits the growing list of players missing from Wimbledon 
                    is a little worrying - although he believes, if anything, 
                    it is to his advantage. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Yes there have been a number of controversies ahead 
                    of this years tournament with some people pulling out - but 
                    that is there decision. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;It is their career and if they feel they can afford 
                    to miss a tournament as important as Wimbledon then so be 
                    it. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;I don't think it does the game any favours but from 
                    a personal perspective, it gives me more chance of winning 
                    the tournament outright, so I am not going to complain. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;They clearly have their reasons for their decision and 
                    that's their choice.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    Whether the Russian's belief can be turned into silverware 
                    on the grass remains to be seen - but you can guarantee the 
                    racket's will be flying if he fails to deliver. </font><br>
