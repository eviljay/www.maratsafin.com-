                  <br>
                  <i>The ATP Tour's New Balls Please campaign got a boost today 
                  in what was, in one sense, a passing of the torch: Pete Sampras 
                  surrendering three sets to fairly dominating 20-year-old Russian 
                  Marat Safin. The sixth-seeded Safin, who contemplated retirement 
                  earlier this year, showed he has the stuff of a future No. 1. 
                  In winning his first grand slam, he displayed little awe, commited 
                  negligable unforced errors and spanked passing shots past Sampras 
                  time and again. Just as 10 years ago a little known player with 
                  curly hair from California won his first slam here and went 
                  on to greatness, after today's dominating performance, one has 
                  the sense we'll be talking about this Safin kid for years to 
                  come. One knows better than to count Sampras out, but he was 
                  suprisingly flat for a Grand Slam final. One wonders how many 
                  more Slam titles he has in him.</i><br>
                  <br>
                  NEW YORK (AP) -- Marat Safin, a giant with a peach-fuzz face 
                  and a grown-up game, turned Pete Sampras into a weekend hacker. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  In as thorough a thrashing as anyone has ever given the all-time 
                  Grand Slam champion, the 20-year-old Safin became the first 
                  Russian to win the U.S. Open with a 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 victory Sunday 
                  as he stamped himself the player of the future in men's tennis. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Boyish and emotional and blessed with talents beyond his natural 
                  power, Safin celebrated by getting down on his knees and kissing 
                  the court in Arthur Ashe Stadium. <br>
                  <br>
                  The youngest champion since Sampras won the first of his four 
                  U.S. Open titles a decade ago, Safin won his first major title 
                  and only the fifth tournament of his brief career in the most 
                  lopsided victory over a former champion in 25 years. <br>
                  <br>
                  "He reminded me of myself when I was 19 and came here and won 
                  for the first time," said the 29-year-old Sampras. "The way 
                  he's playing he's the future of the game. I didn't feel old. 
                  I felt I was standing next to a big dude.<br>
                  <br>
                  "It's a bit of a humbling feeling to have someone play that 
                  well for that long. He serves harder than I did at 19. He's 
                  more powerful. He doesn't have many holes. He moves well. He's 
                  going to win many majors."<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin, serving at up to 136 mph and whacking a dozen aces to 
                  push his tournament total to 115, never faced so much as a single 
                  break point until the last game when Sampras finally got two 
                  after Safin opened with a double fault, only his second of the 
                  match. <br>
                  <br>
                  "I felt no pressure until last game," Safin said. "He becomes 
                  huge, the racket was huge, everything was huge."<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin wiped away those break points quickly, and closed the 
                  1-hour, 38-minute match with a backhand pass that zipped by 
                  Sampras as so many others had before. <br>
                  <br>
                  Sampras, holder of 13 Grand Slam titles, had lost only twice 
                  before in a major final - against Stefan Edberg in the 1992 
                  U.S. Open and Andre Agassi in the 1995 Australian Open. <br>
                  <br>
                  No one had lost in the final so badly since Edberg beat Jim 
                  Courier in 1991. And no former champion had gone down so hard 
                  since Jimmy Connors lost to Manuel Orantes in 1975. <br>
                  <br>
                  Asked how he returned Sampras' serve so well, Safin replied, 
                  "You think I know?" <br>
                  <br>
                  Sampras unleashed a 131 mph ace to start the match, a message 
                  intended to intimidate the Russian in his first major final. 
                  But Safin resolutely stood his ground time after time, waiting 
                  for his chances. <br>
                  <br>
                  At 3-3 in the first set, on a mild afternoon with a slight breeze, 
                  Safin created his first break point at 15-40 with a sizzling 
                  forehand pass into the corner that Sampras watched like a spectator. 
                  Two points later, Safin rocketed back a return winner that seemed 
                  faster than Sampras 124 mph serve. Sampras barely caught a glimpse 
                  of the ball going past him. <br>
                  <br>
                  That was all Safin needed as he cruised on his serve, yielding 
                  only nine points in five service games and going to deuce only 
                  once.<br>
                  <br>
                  The second set turned at the same 3-3 juncture. After Sampras 
                  served the first of his double faults, Safin pounced again, 
                  setting up the first break point of the match with a spectacular 
                  running backhand pass, and taking the game with a solid return 
                  Sampras slugged long. <br>
                  <br>
                  Once more, Safin had no trouble holding serve to close the set, 
                  and his victory assumed an air of inevitability when Safin took 
                  a 3-0 lead in the third set.<br>
                  <br>
                  "I really didn't have my game today," Sampras said. "He played 
                  so well, served big. He was not intimidated. He's a champion. 
                  He's young. He's going to get better and better. "I tried to 
                  mix my serve. It didn't work. I tried to chip and charge. It 
                  didn't work. Everything I tried didn't seem to work. All credit 
                  to him." <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin earned $800,000, giving him more than $3 million in his 
                  brief career, and he moved into the No. 3 spot in the yearlong 
                  rankings. Sampras will be No. 1 in the new rankings Monday, 
                  and Gustavo Kuerten will be No. 2. <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin is only the second Russian to capture a Grand Slam title. 
                  Yevgeny Kafelnikov won the 1996 French and 1999 Australian Opens.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin's arrival as a Grand Slam champion could be seen coming 
                  the past two years. Everyone in tennis knew he had enormous 
                  talents - the brutal two-fisted backhand, the crushing forehand, 
                  the huge serves, the feathery touch. All this plus a 6-foot-4 
                  body with long, strong legs that allowed him to cover the court. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Of Safin's many brilliant shots against Sampras, none stood 
                  out more than a sprint he made diagonally across the court from 
                  the baseline to the net to chase down a half-volley drop shot 
                  by Sampras. Safin reached it backhanded with his long arms just 
                  before the ball touched the ground, and he flicked it at a devastatingly 
                  sharp angle over the net and out of Sampras' reach.<br>
                  <br>
                  But just as everyone had raved about Safin's blossoming talents, 
                  there was the recognition that his temper often got the best 
                  of him. He became infamous for breaking rackets - 48 last year, 
                  about 36 this year, including two at the Open. He also had a 
                  tendency to get down on himself, and was fined for tanking a 
                  match at the Australian Open this year.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin spoke to his friend Alexander Volkov after a series of 
                  first-round losses this year and a 5-11 record through the Monte 
                  Carlo in April. Told 'you must take this more seriously,' Safin 
                  has been on fire since. He beat Sampras in Montreal in August 
                  on the way to winning the Canadian Open. <br>
                  <br>
                  This time, Safin made only 12 unforced errors to Sampras' 25, 
                  and struck 37 winners to Sampras' 32.<br>
                  <br>
                  "I thought about quitting tennis in Indian Wells," Safin said. 
                  "Now I won the U.S. Open. Before, I was thinking about staying 
                  in Top 20 maybe go to Top 15. Now I think about No. 1. I have 
                  a big chance."<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin's path to the final was littered with two five-set matches 
                  and two four-setters.<br>
                  <br>
                  "I was almost on the plane against (Sebastien) Grosjean,' Safin 
                  said. "It was 7-6 in the fifth set. I felt like I don't know 
                  how to play tennis anymore." <br>
                  <br>
