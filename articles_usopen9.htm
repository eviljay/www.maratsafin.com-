                  The current game's newest men's champion and winningest men's 
                  champion today are on their ways home. Marat Safin, following 
                  a day-after trophy photo shoot at New York City's Russian Tea 
                  Room, will fly back to Moscow to celebrate his U.S. Open victory. 
                  And Pete Sampras, a decade after he won his first of 13 Grand 
                  Slams, will head home to Los Angeles to prepare for his wedding. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  These were the last two of 128 men who were still standing when 
                  Sunday's final match arrived. For on-lookers that fact may not 
                  have been surprising: Safin is one of the rising stars featured 
                  in the ATP Tour's 'New Balls, Please' campaign, and Sampras 
                  has been called the greatest champion of his time. But for the 
                  players personally, it's been a tumultuous year that has been 
                  capped with triumph after struggle. <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Marat Safin, 20<br>
                  <br>
                  The Moscow native has been surrounded by the game since his 
                  first day. Both parents are athletes and his mother, who played 
                  at Roland Garros, now coaches his sister Dinara. As a youngster 
                  Safin enjoyed playing ice hockey, but favored tennis. His parents 
                  secured him a sponsor and, at age 14, shipped him to Spain for 
                  specialized instruction that ultimately shaped his raw talent 
                  into the hearty, patient and strong play exhibited by clay-court 
                  stalwarts. <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin -- who claims earning his first point in a Satellite (the 
                  minor-minor leagues of pro tennis) was a bigger victory at the 
                  time than the U.S. Open trophy was Sunday -- worked very hard 
                  to climb up the rankings. He made great progress in 1997, moving 
                  from No. 450 to No. 194. The following two years he broke the 
                  Top 50 and the Top 25. But 2000 has been his true breakthrough, 
                  and he hit No. 3 this week because of his New York performance.<br>
                  <br>
                  Yet less than six months ago Safin was very discouraged.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin lost every match he played for the year's first five tour 
                  events, including the Australian Open that fined him for allegedly 
                  tanking a match. While he got to the semifinals in Copenhagen 
                  at the end of February, March started poorly with a second-round 
                  loss at Indian Wells. <br>
                  <br>
                  'I think about quitting the tennis in Indian Wells,' said Safin, 
                  who found his form on the Spanish clay where he won back-to-back 
                  events at Barcelona and Mallorca. 'I start to play better, and 
                  before I was thinking to stay in the Top 20. With luck, I can 
                  finish in Top 20. Maybe I can go to Top 15.'<br>
                  <br>
                  The summer shaped up well as he made four final showings en 
                  route to winning the U.S. Open.<br>
                  <br>
                  'Now I'm thinking about No. 1 in the world. I have a big chance, 
                  so it's a big difference,' Safin said. <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin notes two events that directly contributed to his career 
                  success.<br>
                  <br>
                  Three years ago his sister gave him a present -- a gold ring 
                  -- as a present before a Challenger event in Holland.<br>
                  <br>
                  'Actually, it's funny. When she just make me a present [of this 
                  ring], I start to win matches, I start to play great...I was 
                  like 400. She make me a present -- I finish the year in Top 
                  200. I'm still with it. I'm already 6 in the world,' said Safin, 
                  with the ring, hanging on a gold necklace, just peeking out 
                  his Adidas shirt. 'It gives me luck.'<br>
                  <br>
                  The other catalyst to his success wasn't about luck at all, 
                  it was all about attitude. Finally this summer, the words of 
                  his ex-coach and Andrei Chesnokov, his current coach-friend, 
                  made sense.<br>
                  <br>
                  'Just fight' was the message. 'When you're playing bad, you 
                  have to fight -- I didn't fight,' Safin said. 'You know how 
                  many matches I lose 6-0 in the second set? I mean, it was a 
                  disaster. I was just making Christmas presents. I cannot do 
                  this. So I start to fight.' It's paid off.<br>
                  <br>
                  But the killer instinct is reserved for the court. Safin's charm 
                  is revealed through the jokes and tipped-head, open-mouthed 
                  laughs that spike his typically monotone Russian conversation. 
                  It's a special time for him, turning from journeyman to a man 
                  to beat. <br>
                  <br>
                  And, the man who just downed Pete Sampras in a method that stumped 
                  the No. 1, almost resembled a trusting but lost boy when standing 
                  on court in front of 100 jockeying photographers. 'Over here, 
                  Marat,' 'Kiss the trophy,' 'Turn to the left,' they instructed.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now that he's had some practice posing with a heavy trophy, 
                  the next time he'll likely handle it in the expert fashion he 
                  handled Sampras just moments earlier. <br>
