                    your life, will it not, Marat?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: </b>Yeah, because I get into the Top 100. Very 
                    important for me, because I get in Grand Prix. So I'm very 
                    happy to make three rounds here. Now I am with more confidence, 
                    and I'm playing well, so I'm very happy. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> And if offered a wildcard into Wimbledon, 
                    would you accept it? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah. I will ask, but I'm not sure. I 
                    think I have to play quallies.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION: </b>But if you were offered a wildcard into the 
                    main draw? MARAT <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>SAFIN:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> Pioline is known in the circuit as a player 
                    who has some problems finishing matches. Did you know that?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I didn't know because nobody told me (laughter).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> If you knew that, would you change your way 
                    of playing at the end? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No, because, doesn't matter, because he 
                    was playing good. And I was a little bit down because I lost 
                    my serve in the fifth set. So I was just finishing the match. 
                    I show bad today. No chance for me in the fifth set, I think.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> Do you regret trying to make an ace on the 
                    second serve?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> When I threw the ball, topspin or ace?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> Ace.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> But I was 5-3 up. I lost my chance, so 
                    bad luck. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> So this match is a big learning experience 
                    for you? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, because you have to be a little 
                    bit clever on the important points. You can't lost your serve 
                    when you are 5-3 up first set. You have to be clever against 
                    Pioline, because he's not, I don't know, 300 or 400. He play 
                    all the match, so more concentration on important points.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> What did Rafael tell you after the match?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> Bad luck, nothing more.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    QUESTION:</b> What was it like to be out there with 14,001 
                    people against you? Was it easy to lose your concentration 
                    there? Did you feel you were fighting everybody? Was it an 
                    experience such as you've never undergone?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah. In the first two sets, yeah, doesn't 
                    matter public. When you start to lose concentration, you are 
                    losing. It's people, I don't know, racquets, everything is 
                    bad. That's where you have to play. When you are tired, people 
                    are shouting, you lose concentration, sure. I think that's 
                    why I lost my serve on fifth set. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> How much of it had to do with fatigue, the 
                    fourth and fifth set? How tired were you? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>No, I wasn't tired. I can run a little 
                    bit more now. I relax yesterday. I was okay for the match. 
                    My physical condition is perfect, for me. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> Did the presence of Ronaldo and Roberto Carlos, 
                    Denislon make you lose your concentration?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yes (laughter). <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> You were thumbs up with him?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, because I never saw Ronaldo like 
                    this, so near, so close to me. No, nothing, no. I don't care. 
                    Okay, Ronaldo, very good. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> Were you aware that Anna came and sat next 
                    to him? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Anna? So beautiful. I blew the return 
                    after (laughter).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> How does this defeat compare with the one 
                    you suffered against Jim Courier in the Davis Cup?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> What?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION: </b>How does this defeat compare with the one 
                    you suffered in the Davis Cup?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Davis Cup, it's a different tournament 
                    because, I don't know, it's another competition. You are playing 
                    for the country. I was more nervous because you're playing 
                    for the team, for Russia, for your country, also in America. 
                    Here, just you're -- I play for me. If I lost this match, 
                    I don't care. There you can't lost. You can't tank the match 
                    or miss the points, easy points, you have to play whole points 
                    there. Here, you just play for you. It's different. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> How much have you played on grass?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Never. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> Not one match? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No. I didn't step on the grass. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION: </b>Practice? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No step never on my life. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> Practicing in Spain, do you think that grass 
                    is for the cows? The Spaniards always say that grass is for 
                    the cows. Do you have that image of Wimbledon? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Yeah, we'll see. Everybody is saying it's 
                    tough to play there because you have to go to the net and 
                    play some volley, serve well. I don't know. I will try. We'll 
                    see what happen there. I have to practice a little bit more 
                    volley to play in Wimbledon, so I will see.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> What impressed you about Pioline today? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Nothing. I don't know. I think it's a 
                    normal player. Nothing special. For me it's nothing special. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> What did he do well?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> He play all the match in the same level, 
                    so he don't go, I don't know, playing unbelievable and throwing 
                    everything out, like me, because I'm losing concentration. 
                    For example, today, I lost my concentration 5-3. He never 
                    do it. So it's the difference. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION: </b>How much confidence do you have this tournament?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>How much? I think I can play with every 
                    player from Top 10, I don't know, Top 100. I think I can beat 
                    good players. I can serve, I can return. I have baseline shots. 
                    I can play same level like them. It's just this, because before 
                    I think, "He is playing unbelievable tennis, I'm here, I can't 
                    serve, I can't return, I don't have any shots." Now I think 
                    I can play with everybody now. I can beat some players (laughter).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>QUESTION:</b> You've caused a lot of excitement. Can we 
                    expect to see you in the United States at the US Open and 
                    some of our summer tournaments? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Yeah.<br>
                    <br>
