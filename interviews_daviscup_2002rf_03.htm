                  An Interview with Marat Safin</strong><br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Could you describe your emotion on match point, just 
                  when you won the point?</strong><br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I was praying to finish in three sets. Just when 
                  was everything finished, I was so happy. I didn't have to go 
                  to the fourth set because you never know how it can finish. 
                  He started to play well. Also, my physical conditions, I was 
                  getting tired already. I wanted to finish in three sets. I was 
                  lucky that I could make it. <br>
<br>
                  <strong>What about your happiness? </strong><br>
                  <br>

                    MARAT SAFIN: &quot;Happiness,&quot; what do you mean? We still 
                    have to win. It's okay to win one match. For me, for myself, 
                    it's great, but I hope it will help the team, you know, it 
                    will help to Misha to win the last match, just to win Davis 
                    Cup. Why not? It's the last point. Two Juniors are playing 
                    basically. We'll see (smiling).<br>
<br>
                  <strong>Do you remember the last time you played so well and 
                  so consistently from the first to the last point? </strong><br>
                  <br>

                    MARAT SAFIN: Two days ago (laughter). <br>
                  No, I think probably Bercy when I won here. I think I played 
                  a great match. Every match I was playing, I was full of confidence, 
                  even if I didn't make any good results before that tournament. 
                  Just, I don't know, nothing to lose. Playing outside of Russia, 
                  playing against a big team, against all the spectators, it just 
                  was great. I was inspired. <br>
<br>
                  <strong>You have been pulling your team for the past three days. 
                  Can you describe what it's like? Is it difficult? </strong><br>
                  <br>

                    MARAT SAFIN: It's difficult. It's difficult emotionally because 
                    every match you play, it's difficult to play because you're 
                    not playing only for yourself, you're playing for the team, 
                    for the country. Everybody's watching you. They want you to 
                    win. <br>
                    It's really difficult, you know, to fight against the player, 
                    against the crowd, against everything, like when you choke, 
                    which is normal, being nervous in a match, especially in the 
                    final. <br>
                    But I'm happy. I want to win. It doesn't matter how tired 
                    you are, how bad you're playing, doesn't make any difference, 
                    just we want to win. It's the last match. It's also my last 
                    match of the year, it was. I'm happy to finish. I have done 
                    everything what I could do to help the team to win the Davis 
                    Cup. <br>
<br>
                  <strong>How do you explain you recovered so well after the doubles 
                  yesterday? </strong><br>
                  <br>

                    MARAT SAFIN: Still young, youth, nothing else. I'm just 22 
                    years old, and my body let me play so many hours without being 
                    tired. The masseur, he did a great job. Also the support, 
                    it means a lot. I mean, if it would go to five sets, to play 
                    a tough match, then it will be difficult. After two days in 
                    a row playing tough matches, emotionally and physically you 
                    are getting tired. Still, I'm 22, so it saves my life today.<br>
<br>
                  <strong>What was the key of the match today? </strong><br>
                  <br>

                    MARAT SAFIN: Just start from the beginning playing your game 
                    without giving to Sebastien any chance to control the match, 
                    otherwise... He's a really smart player. He knows how to play 
                    in the tough moments. He knows how to read the other play 
                    player. He knows where to put the ball. <br>
                    I was going for it. Why not? Some shots I had to go for it, 
                    just put pressure all the time on Sebastien, on the return, 
                    on his serve, just move him around the court, just going to 
                    the net. <br>
<br>
                  <strong>You think that the easy success against him in Roland 
                  Garros helped you today? </strong><br>
                  <br>

                    MARAT SAFIN: Yes, of course. Last time we played in Roland 
                    Garros, I won. I just understood how I have to play against 
                    him. It also gave me some kind of confidence that I can beat 
                    him. Already I knew from the beginning what I have to do, 
                    when I have to do. I was also a little bit lucky at some point 
                    of the match.<br>
<br>
                  <strong>When did you know that Kafelnikov would not play? Does 
                  it change anything in your mind? </strong><br>
                  <br>

                    MARAT SAFIN: Actually, from yesterday. We decided to put Mikhail 
                    because Yevgeny was tired after the doubles. He couldn't play 
                    today, so we decided to put the young player. Why not? We'll 
                    see if he can manage to win, at least show great tennis. <br>
<br>
                  <strong>Did you have a conversation with Yevgeny yesterday after 
                  the doubles? Did you help him decide not to play?</strong> <br>
                  <br>

                    MARAT SAFIN: No. We have enough people, smart people, in tennis. 
                    Shamil and some other coaches, we have Cherkasov with us, 
                    some other players, explayers, that understand tennis. They 
                    decided what to do. <br>
<br>
                  <strong>Did Yevgeny volunteer not to play? </strong><br>
                  <br>

                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, because he said himself, &quot;Whatever 
                    you decide, guys, I will respect it.&quot; <br>
<br>
                  <strong>We saw Golanov beside you. How did he help you? </strong><br>
                  <br>

                    MARAT SAFIN: A lot. A lot of support is what I need. Some 
                    stage of the match, he gave me some good advices, not to go 
                    back in the third set, to keep advancing to the net, keep 
                    looking for the net, not giving up. Of course, there was a 
                    lot of support from the Russian team, from Yevgeny, from Dennis 
                    and from my captain. It helps me a lot. <br>
<br>
                  <strong>You haven't lost that many matches in Bercy. Are you 
                  inspired by this place? </strong><br>
                  <br>

                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, it seems like I cannot lose a match here 
                    (smiling). I like that atmosphere. I like the situation of 
                    the court. I don't know. I always played well here. I always 
                    did a great job. I played my best tennis here in Bercy. <br>
<br>
                  <strong>Could you tell us why you had a verbal abuse? </strong><br>
                  <br>

                    MARAT SAFIN: I had a verbal abuse? <br>
<br>
                  <strong>A warning. What did you say? </strong><br>
                  <br>

                    MARAT SAFIN: I said what I thought about it. I didn't accuse 
                    anybody. I didn't want to offend anybody. I just didn't offend 
                    anybody. Just I gave my opinion. That's okay. I was pissed 
                    because you know also it was a very important ball for me. 
                    I was sure the ball was out. But just it happens. I didn't 
                    meant anything to the chair umpire at all. <br>
<br>
                  <strong>Was it difficult to come back in the match? </strong><br>
                  <br>

                    MARAT SAFIN: No, it was disappointing because I needed so 
                    badly that point. But it's okay. Everybody's making mistakes. 
                    I'm not abusing him. I can't do anything. Just it was my opinion.<br>
<br>
                  <strong>Now you are on holidays. What are your plans? </strong><br>
                  <br>

                    MARAT SAFIN: The year's finished. I was waiting for it so 
                    badly. I wanted to finish the year with a good match. I played 
                    it. Now I can go for vacations being relaxed for a couple 
                    of weeks. <br>
