                        U.S. Open champion Marat Safin suffered further disappointment 
                        after a first round exit at the Olympics last month, by 
                        losing to unfancied Frenchman Nicolas Escude at the CA-Trophy 
                        on Monday. <br>
                        In his first appearance since the defeat at the Sydney 
                        Games to another Frenchman, Fabrice Santoro, the top seeded 
                        Russian bowed out of the opening round in Vienna's Stadthalle 
                        5-7, 6-3, 7-6 (7-5). <br>
                        Safin's early exit is yet another blow for tournament 
                        organizers, who had last-minute cancellations from Pete 
                        Sampras and Australia's Lleyton Hewitt. <br>
                        Although Safin is second in the Champions' Race and has 
                        already assured himself a place in the inaugural Tennis 
                        Masters Cup in Lisbon, he was upset at having missed earning 
                        points in Vienna.<br>
                        "I wanted to earn points here to fight for the number 
                        one spot," he said. "My next goal is to be number one. 
                        I would like to tell my kids I was the best player in 
                        the world, even if just for one week.<br>
                        "It's important to always have another goal. The U.S. 
                        Open title was not the end of my career, it marked the 
                        beginning of it. I have enough motivation in me for the 
                        rest of my life." <br>
                        After the Sydney debacle, which came directly after his 
                        maiden Grand Slam triumph and a fifth season title at 
                        Tashkent, Safin took two weeks off to relax. <br>
                        "It's hard to get back into the game after a break. Escude 
                        played really well," said Safin, adding the Frenchman 
                        had pressured him by launching full attacks on his second 
                        serves. <br>
                        The 20-year-old Safin claimed the first set of a three 
                        and a half hour match by hammering down a forehand to 
                        break for 6-5. <br>
                        Visibly shocked by Escude's challenge, Safin dropped serve 
                        twice in the fourth and sixth games mainly due to imprecise 
                        shots and first serve misses. He lost the set despite 
                        reducing the deficit to 5-2.<br>
                        The pair exchanged breaks three times and Safin fought 
                        off a match point to level 5-5 but was defeated 7-5 in 
                        the tiebreak.<br>

                        It has been a week to remember for Marat Safin, the recently 
                        crowned US Open champion. Following his back-to-back titles 
                        in New York and the President's Cup in Tashkent, the 20-year-old 
                        Russian has become the new ATP Champions Race 2000 leader 
                        and one of three men to secure places in the Tennis Masters 
                        Cup - Lisboa.<br>
                        Safin and Roland Garros winner Gustavo Kuerten join Sampras 
                        as qualifiers for the prestigious eight-man year-end championships, 
                        which begin in Portugal on November 28. <br>
                        Safin, with 639 points, is 247 points ahead of the player

                        Top-seed Marat Safin of Russia was eliminated from the 
                        Olympic tennis tournament in the first round on Wednesday 
                        by Fabrice Santoro of France. Santoro, who had won all 
                        four of their previous meetings,defeated the U.S. Open 
                        champion 1-6 6-1 6-4. <br>
                        Safin, shock straight-sets winner over Pete Sampras in 
                        the U.S. Open final 10 days ago, fell 1-6 6-1 6-4 to Santoro, 
                        who now has a 5-0 career record against him. <br>
                        The 20-year-old Russian, arriving late in Sydney weary 
                        from a hectic travel schedule, could not have dreamed 
                        of a more threatening first-round opponent. <br>
                        After his famous victory in New York, the world number 
                        two headed straight for Tashkent, Uzbekistan, to play 
                        in the President's Cup tournament, winning the final there 
                        on Sunday before racing to Sydney for the Games. <br>
                        Faced with his nemesis first up at Olympic Park, Safin 
                        was again undone by the deceptive Frenchman, a master 
                        of disguise and change of pace. Santoro, 27, reached match 
                        point when Safin sent an overhead shot long and then clinched 
                        the upset after his service return clipped the netcord. 
                        The Russian could do nothing but set up the Frenchman

                        After conquering the world's best at the U.S. Open, Russia's 
                        Marat Safin appears ready to capture Olympic gold in Sydney. 
                        <br>
                        Safin geared up for his trek to Australia by capturing 
                        his second straight ATP Tour title today at the $525,000 
                        President's Cup tennis event. <br>
                        Seeded second, Safin extended his winning streak to 12 
                        matches by defeating unseeded Davide Sanguinetti of Italy, 
                        <b>6-3, 6-4</b>, and capture an ATP Tour-leading fifth 
                        title of the year. <br>
                        "I came here to win," Safin said. "It is one step forward 
                        where nobody's better than me, at least for one week. 
                        It means I'm a good professional player."<br>
                        After capturing his first Grand Slam title one week ago 
                        in New York, Safin battled jet lag early in this tournament 
                        and overcame a sore shoulder throughout the week to claim 
                        his sixth career singles title and a first prize of $70,000. 
                        <br>
                        The 20-year-old Safin continued his remarkable season 
                        turnaround after starting off 5-11. He has won 24 of his 
                        last 26 matches and is 57-21 overall. Today's victory 
                        moved him past U.S. Open runner-up Pete Sampras atop ATP 
                        Champions Race 2000 and second in the entry system rankings.<br>
                        "At the end of the year, the Race and the ESP (Entry System) 
                        are more or less the same," Safin said. "I have a good 
                        chance to be No. 1 in both."<br>
                        Safin will travel to Sydney, Australia to play singles 
                        and doubles at the Olympics. He is the top seed in the 
                        men's singles draw and will face Frenchman Fabrice Santoro, 
                        who has beaten the Russian in their four previous meetings. 
                        <br>
                        "Sydney is a very tough draw for me," the Russian said. 
                        "The first round is a very tough player for me. He plays 
                        tennis I don't like. But I will try to beat him for once 
                        in my life." <br>

                        team at Sydney, lost to Davide Sanguinetti of Italy, 7-5, 
                        6-3. <br>
                        The loss continues a disappointing year for Kafelnikov,

                        is scheduled to play singles and doubles at Sydney, but 
                        will stay in Uzbekistan for at least one more day after

                        Safin, seeded second, made the long trip here after claiming 
                        his first career Grand Slam title in New York on Sunday. 
                        He became the first Russian to win the U.S. Open with

                        winner Pete Sampras. <br>
                        The 20-year-old Safin is tied with four others for the 
                        ATP Tour lead with four titles. He also won at Barcelona, 
                        Mallorca and the Tennis Masters Series event in Toronto. 
                        <br>
                        His win on Sunday put him third on the ATP Champions Race

                        Next up for Safin is Jamie Delgado of Britain, who was 
                        leading Stephane Huet, 6-1, 2-0, when his French opponent 
                        retired with a back injury. American Justin Gimelstob

                        the expectations are high for him to do well this week. 
                        "You have to show people you are the winner of the U.S.

                        7-6(1), and Sampras overcame the challenge of young Australian 
                        Lleyton Hewitt 7-6(7), 6-4, 7-6(5). <br>
                        It will be the third meeting between these two, both having 
                        scored one win. Sampras won their first encounter at Flushing 
                        Meadows two years ago, easily defeating Safin 6-4, 6-3, 
                        6-2 in the fourth round. Safin gained his revenge at the 
                        Tennis Masters Series Canada a few weeks ago, ousting 
                        Pete Sampras in a close quarterfinal match 6-4, 3-6, 7-6(8) 
                        after saving two match points. <br>
                        Sampras enters the match with the experience of 15 Grand 
                        Slam finals and 13 titles, while Toronto was Safin's first 
                        major title. <br>
                        Apart from their age and experience, the styles of Safin 
                        and Sampras are also diverse: Sampras, one of the greatest 
                        players ever, has a classical style, a strong serve and 
                        volley game, but can also dominate ralleys with his impressive 
                        forehand. Safin prefers to stay back, he puts his opponents 
                        under pressure with his powerful groundstrokes. He volleys 
                        well, however, and has an enormous reach at the net.<br>
                        In the semis, Safin's powerful baseline tennis was just 
                        too much for Todd Martin, who tried to attack the net 
                        as often as possible, but was regularly passed by the 
                        young Russian. 1999 finalist Martin, who staged one of 
                        the comebacks of the tournament against Carlos Moya earlier 
                        this week, managed to come back from being down a break 
                        in all three sets, but lacked the consistency to counter 
                        Safin's power tennis.<br>
                        Safin was arguably the fitter player and clearly dominated 
                        the decisive situations, especially the tie-breaks in 
                        the second and third sets. "I was tired," Martin admitted. 
                        "But even if I had been at 100 percent the score could 
                        still have been the same."<br>
                        "It nice to be in the final," Safin commented. "But one 
                        thing is still missing: I want to win here."<br>
                        Pete Sampras had to ovcercome the quick legs und the impressive 
                        energy of Lleyton Hewitt. The young Australian got off 
                        to the better start, holding his first service games with 
                        ease, while Sampras had to save a break point in the third 
                        game. Leading 5-4, Sampras failed to convert three set 
                        points, and Hewitt saved another set point at 5-6 with 
                        a forehand passing shot. In the tie-break, Hewitt had 
                        a set point on his own serve, but hit an easy forehand 
                        wide, and <br>
                        Sampras took the set 7-6(7). Sampras eased through the 
                        second set with an impressive performance, but in the 
                        beginning of the third set, Hewitt took advantage when 
                        Sampras' concentration lapsed for a moment and took a 
                        4-1 lead. Sampras, however, came back, and won the third 
                        set tie-break 7-6(5). <br>
                        "Being an American it feels great to be in the final," 
                        Sampras said. "It is not going to be an easy match. Marat 
                        is a great player with a great game." <br>

                        Juan Carlos Ferrero on Tuesday to storm into the quarterfinals 
                        of the U.S. Open tennis championships. Safin, who needed 
                        five sets to get through his two previous matches, crushed 
                        his good friend Ferrero 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 on Arthur Ashe Stadium

                        Sixth-seeded Marat Safin got through two rain delays to 
                        eliminate Frenchman Sebastien Grosjean 6-4, 7-6 (3), 1-6, 
                        3-6, 7-5 (5) in a third round match on Arthur Ashe Stadium 
                        on a rainy afternoon. Safin won the first two sets, but 
                        let the lead slip away as Grosjean rallied to tie the 
                        match at two sets all. With Safin serving at 4-4, 30-15, 
                        play was suspended at approximately 2 p.m. due to a torrential 
                        downpour. When play resumed, Safin and Grosjean each held 
                        serve and force a fifth-set tiebreak. With Grosjean serving 
                        at 4-5 in the tiebreak, rain once again began to fall 
                        and play was suspended a second time. At 5:27 p.m., Safin 
                        and Grosjean returned to the court and played three points 
                        to complete the match as Grosjean's last shot landed wide.

                        Russian tennis player Marat Safin said on Thursday that 
                        personal problems lead to his decision to part company 
                        with coach Andrei Chesnokov.<br>
                        Asked if the break-up was temporary Safin, ranked ninth 
                        in the ATP Tour Champions' race, told the daily Sport-Express: 
                        "No, I will no longer work with Andrei.<br>
                        "But I would rather not go into the details. I will only 
                        say that we experienced personal problems."<br>
                        Safin, 20, struggled early in the year but won two ATP 
                        titles in Barcelona and Mallorca and reached the final 
                        in Hamburg after linking with Chesnokov in April.<br>
                        He lost in the quarter-finals of the French Open to Magnus 
                        Norman earlier this month.<br>
                        Chesnokov, a former top 10 player himself, was quoted 
                        in the newspaper Izvestia on Tuesday as saying: "We were 
                        supposed to discuss our relationship after the French 
                        Open but Marat suddenly left to prepare for Wimbledon. 
                        It's fair to say that both parties just didn't find enough 
                        time for each other."<br>
                        Safin seeded 15th at Wimbledon, is working with Tony Pickard, 
                        once the coach of former Wimbledon champion Stefan Edberg. 
                        "I'm happy with my choice (of Pickard)," Safin said. "I 
                        think it has been working well so far."<br>
                        Safin was due to play Martin Damm of the Czech Republic 
                        in the second round at Wimbledon on Thursday after beating
