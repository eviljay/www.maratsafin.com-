As it is too many times his habit, the<BR>Russian didn’t have the means to dominate his fluctuations of temper.<BR>Alternating between the best and the worse, the winner of the Australian<BR>Open 2005 didn’t present his best outlook for his first battle at Roland<BR>Garros. Beaten by Fernando Gonzalez 6-3, 1-6, 6-3, 6-1, the former world<BR>number 1, bows out for the first time on the first round of the<BR>International Championships of France. A complainer on court, Safin reacted<BR>in the same manner on his way out of the court, avoiding the press<BR>conference. <BR><BR>Marat Safin has not once again managed to dominate his temper. But we love<BR>him also for that. His raging fits, his tantrums, and the racquets broken on<BR>court. Loved by the crowd by his temper, the Russian is anyway the first<BR>victim of his lack of serenity. Throughout his past, the former world number<BR>1 has always had to fight against the two Safins inside him: the good and<BR>the bad. Today it was the second that won over the first. The nonchalant<BR>walk, the head kept down, as if all the troubles of the world were placed on<BR>his large shoulders, the Russian was incapable of finding the right way to<BR>fight Fernando Gonzalez, an opponent that he had dominated twice in two<BR>matches. <BR><BR>Feverish, hesitant, Marat Safin seemed to be complaining of one of his "off<BR>days", where nothing comes out as he wishes. Lacking in success, the pupil<BR>of Peter Lundgren has more than once let his frustration show. With the face<BR>red with anger, the winner of the US Open 2000 never lacked the support,<BR>with the crowd always on his side. But when luck doesn’t smile... Adding up<BR>unforced errors, he couldn’t break the solidity of the Chilean, a clay<BR>specialist that also always hits the ball hard. The bouncing lob of Gonzalez<BR>has considerably bothered the Russian, forced to cover too much ground to<BR>keep the ball inside the court... <BR><BR>Gonzalez overcame a hurdle<BR><BR>Quarter finalist at Roland Garros in 2003, his best performance at Porte<BR>d'Auteuil, the Chilean has never doubted. Full of confidence by his<BR>semi-final at Monte-Carlo, that has allowed him to enter the Top 10 for the<BR>first time, before reaching the number 8 place on the 15th of May (the best<BR>ranking ever of his career), Gonzalez battled on Centre Court to break the<BR>Russian. The merit is all his. "The conditions were really very difficult<BR>today", explained Gonzalez. "There was any more clay because of the wind! It<BR>was a long match and I tried to tire him, to push him all the way. I’m happy<BR>because against Safin, I had the feeling that I had gotten the worst draw.<BR>But I’m moving well, I feel well physically and I have the feeling that I<BR>can build the points without taking many risks." <BR><BR>As for Safin, he should without a doubt make a point of starting again from<BR>a good base. Eliminated for the first time since his debut at Roland Garros<BR>in eight participations (even though he has always reached at least the<BR>third round), the 53rd world player with 15 titles conquered in the circuit,<BR>can be angry at himself. After having had to miss the two last Grand Slam<BR>tournaments because of his left knee, Safin has already had to pack his<BR>bags. Visibly pressed to turn a page, he didn’t think it was necessary to<BR>appear before the press. An attitude that will be sanctioned with a fine, of<BR>which we will know the value on Wednesday. But Safin doesn’t care about<BR>that...<BR><BR>_______________<BR><BR>Article found in the website of the French sports newspaper L’Équipe.<BR><A href="javascript:ol('http://www.lequipe.fr/Tennis/ROLAND_06_300506_H.html');"><U>http://www.lequipe.fr/Tennis/ROLAND_06_300506_H.html</U></A><BR><BR>The original article is longer, with the summary of the entire day but I<BR>translated only the part that regards Marat’s match<BR><BR>GONZALEZ HOLDS HIS PLACE<BR>by Peggy BERGERE <BR><BR>Fernando Gonzalez (nr 9) was unmerciful. Stronger, faster, sharper, and more<BR>precise, the Chilean overclassed Marat Safin on the first round of the<BR>tournament on Tuesday (6-3, 1-6, 6-3, 1-6). In his eighth presence at the<BR>International Championships of France, the Russian, who went out of the<BR>Central Court under an ovation, didn’t have the means to rival with the<BR>semi-finalist of the Masters Series of Monte-Carlo. Out of the circuit after<BR>almost five months due to a recurrent injury in his right knee, the former<BR>world number 1 struggles to regain the level of his game that lead him to<BR>consecration at the Australian Open of 2005. Pilling up unforced errors (51<BR>in total during the match, against 21 of his opponent), the Russian didn’t<BR>manage to trouble a «client» that counts only three defeats on this surface<BR>this season. Only Roger Federer (in the semis at Monte-Carlo), Rafael Nadal<BR>(in the quarter finals of Rome) and also Fernando Verdasco (in the second<BR>round of Hamburg) have managed to dominate the Chilean, one to be wary of. <BR><BR>________<BR><BR>Another article found in the website of the France2 TV channel.<BR><A href="javascript:ol('http://roland-garros.france2.fr/journaldutournoi/3005/21614984-fr.php');"><U>http://roland-garros.france2.fr/journaldutournoi/3005/21614984-fr.php</U></A><BR><BR>Again the original article was longer but this is the part that concerns<BR>Marat.<BR><BR>By Grégory JOUIN <BR>Published on 30th May at 21h11m<BR>Marat Safin, is not allergic to the clay. Semi-finalist in 2002 and<BR>quarter-finalist in 2000 at Roland-Garros, the talented Tatar has even<BR>started his tennis on clay as a teenager in Valencia. He is strongly capable<BR>of great efforts to reach success and prestige, as his victories over<BR>Agassi, Kuerten, Mantilla or Ferrero in Paris can avail.<BR><BR>Injured for a long time (he did not attend Melbourne), Safin fell behind<BR>even though he reached a semi-final in Valencia against Almagro. After that<BR>he never could again build a track record of matches on clay, clashing<BR>remarkably quickly out of Monte Carlo and Rome.<BR><BR>Against a Fernando Gonzalez, well rooted on the baseline and who build a<BR>wall with his forehand over more than three hours, the nonchalant Marat<BR>didn’t have the foundations to equalise. With his talent the winner of the<BR>Australian Open in 2005 did momentarily fought back to a set all, playing<BR>not far from his best level. But the Chilean quickly got back on track,<BR>forcing his way in a Wagnerian Valkyrian style, adding up winners to gain an<BR>inexorable advantage. The contrast with the pale reply given by Safin was<BR>impressive. And even a little sad. The tournament looses one of its (too)<BR>rare magicians.<BR></P>

"Gonzalez plays very well and it will be a very<BR>difficult match. But anything can happen, the good as well as the bad. I<BR>will need to play my best game." Safin, the winner in Melbourne in 2005 and<BR>of the US Open in 2000, has never left his mark in Roland-Garros.<BR><BR>"I love Roland-Garros. It's a tournament that has always been important in<BR>my career and that has given me many good things. It was here that I made my<BR>breakthrough in 1998.

<P>Former pro Peter Lundgren took Marat Safin under his wing in May 2004. Coach Lundgren - who previously mentored Roger Federer - is confident that his Russian charge will be able to&nbsp;overcome ninth seed Fernando Gonzalez in the first round and go on to greater things.</P>
<P><STRONG>How well is Marat playing at the moment?</STRONG></P>
<P>He's on decent form, but the draw really wasn't kind to him. Now that he's down to around No50 in the world, he's not going to be seeded, so we knew that he might come up against a big name early in the tournament. Fernando Gonzalez won't be easy to beat, but I think that if Marat manages to get through, he can go far, since he's playing well at the moment. For the past three or four days, he has looked very focussed during his practices and less impatient than usual, which is a positive sign. </P>
<P><STRONG>Has he fully recovered from his injury now?</STRONG></P>
<P>He's fine. He's been training hard recently, and his knee has held up, which is great to see. He can give it 100 per cent on court now. A few weeks ago, his knee was bothering him again, but it's fine now, and as long as his knee's OK, then he should be able to do well.</P>
<P><STRONG>What will be the key to his match against Gonzalez?</STRONG></P>
<P>He needs to start off well and make sure he doesn't fall behind straight away. He needs to stay positive and put Gonzalez under pressure throughout. Marat doesn't like to sit back… he prefers to dictate matters on court, so it'll be up to him to boss things once he's out there. </P>
<P><STRONG>Marat seems to like Roland Garros…</STRONG></P>
<P>It's true. He seems to like Paris in general, since he's always done well at Bercy as well. Let's hope this works in his favour over the next two weeks…</P><BR><BR></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></td>
