                  Tennis Magazine, N°277, April 1999.<br>
                  From Valencia, Yannick Cochennec, and Corrine Dubreuil.<br>
                  <br>

                  He was the love at first of the last Roland Garros tournament. 
                  Impressive and lovely, Marat, made no bones about it, in his 
                  first Grand Slam tournament, where he jump at the opportunity 
                  to win over Andre Agassi and Gustavo Kuerten, while taking the 
                  wind out of sails of a surprising performance in the Davis cup, 
                  against the United States. Certain peoples don't know, but since, 
                  he had confirmed. The youngest player ever who have finished 
                  the year in the top 50 ATP ranking, the prodigy of Moscow, 19 
                  year old, is perhaps standing at the edge of a great career. 
                  Portrait of a cool teenager who could play the leading part...<br>
                  <br>
                  Wrack !!!!! a racket is gone. In the Melbourne park court number 
                  2, Marat is getting out of nerves since one hours. On the other 
                  side of the net, Karol Kucera is showing his usual unperturbed 
                  body-language. The seventh seed has almost nothing to do. Generously, 
                  his young opponent is gifting him his qualification to the eighteenth 
                  finals. Crimson face, more because of the rage, than efforts 
                  , Safin, 47th in the world, is transmitting his angry on his 
                  working tool which fragments are representing his &quot;stunning&quot; 
                  performance. In the tribunes, Rafael Mensua, his Spaniard coach, 
                  is observing the extensiveness of the damages. &quot;Marat is 
                  like that&quot; he said later, still shocked. &quot;He is able 
                  to loose his head , but today, he really has committed suicide. 
                  Earlier during the warming, I saw that he was not feeling good. 
                  He got irritated very soon in the match&quot;.<br>
                  At 19 years old (his birthday took place in the 27th of January), 
                  the revelation of the last Roland Garros is now not really a 
                  teenager, nor a &quot;man&quot;. Lost between the sides of his 
                  life river, Marat sails across his internal storms , which are 
                  sometimes violent, like in Australia.<br>
                  <br>
                  Seven month are gone, between the nice French internationals 
                  odyssey , where he sailed to the eighteenth finals thanks to 
                  victories against Andre Agassi and Gustavo Kuerten, and the 
                  stunning performance against Karol Kucera, in Melbourne Park. 
                  During this period, his physical and his status changed. His 
                  short hairs turned to curled hair, with gold reflects , which 
                  tone down his face, and the surprising effect of his first appearance 
                  turned to a real attract for the public, which is seduced by 
                  both his physical advantages and his spectacular game. The smiling 
                  has remained the same. Cool, open-minded, and cordial, here 
                  is Marat Safin. &quot;Now, Marat is a true Mediterranean&quot;, 
                  smiles Raphael Mensua.<br>
                  &quot;Do you prefer me with long hairs or short hairs ?&quot;, 
                  the question is asked in English, with an important Spanish 
                  accent. Russian, Marat Safin ? In Spain, in his red Mitsubishi 
                  300 Electre, which is edging into the raining street of Valencia, 
                  the young man is very far away, on this winter day, from the 
                  snowing streets of Moscow, his native city. &quot;Do you like 
                  Madonna ? I love her&quot;, a little push on a dashboard button, 
                  and the voice of the goddess of the charts comes out. &quot;Do 
                  you want to dance ? Look in there, there is a discotheque that 
                  I appreciate real good. I know all the good places here where 
                  we can have fun&quot;. Inspite of his 194 centimeters, Marat 
                  is comfortably installed in the reduced space of his race car. 
                  Standing on the seat extremely inclined, he is almost in laying 
                  position, but he is still aware, looking to the left and right 
                  side. &quot;I had my driving licence in the last June&quot; 
                  he laughs . &quot;I don't want to be fined too soon. I love 
                  the cars. Hey I'm just 19 years old, it's normal&quot;. And 
                  he laughs loudly while pointing his head straight with his finger. 
                  &quot;Every young men are little mad&quot;. Mad, is the Marat's 
                  story in a certain way. How a teenager of 13 years old, borne 
                  and used to live in Moscow, was drooped a day of the 1993 year, 
                  without his parents, in Valencia on the east cost of Spain ? 
                  The question has exited the curiosity of journalists in Roland 
                  Garros. So Marat had fun in making them confused. &quot;As it 
                  was too long and too complex to explain, I told them that I 
                  didn't remember the all details&quot; he recognises. &quot;I 
                  hope you can spend one hour on your time, and lot of papers, 
                  because it will take lot of space to write all the story&quot;. 
                  The car stop at the bottom of a building which takes place in 
                  a little sad area. This is the night, but inspite of the darkness, 
                  the car expert locate an other red car parked near there. &quot;It's 
                  my old Golf, I offered it to my mother, because it wasn't speeding 
                  enough&quot;. Rauza, his mother, and Dinara, his sister, rejoin 
                  him in Valencia, in last November, but Marat don't live with 
                  them. &quot;I need my independence&quot; he says seriously. 
                  Dinara, 12 years old, is one of the best European players of 
                  his category, and to continue to progress, she choose, like 
                  his brother, to leave Russia, where the training conditions 
                  became terrible. Exceptional fact : Mikhail, the father is in 
                  Spain, for few holidays. In an apartment who seems to be spacious, 
                  but which sounds unoccupied due to the lack of personal estates, 
                  the family meet again, rare event, completely reformed.<br>
                  <br>
                  Mikhail Safin, a former engineer, is still living in Moscow 
                  where he is the director of a gymnasium club mostly dedicated 
                  to the business men. We don't ear from him as a tennis player, 
                  but on the other side, he illustrated himself on the athletics 
                  tracks, becoming the Moscow decathlon champion. On the contrary, 
                  Rauza, his wife, has a very good players visiting-card. Semi-finalist 
                  of the Roland Garros and Wimbledon juniors tournament, as she 
                  was named Rauza Islanova, she, with Olga Morozova, had won in 
                  1968, the prestigious &quot;Annie Soisbault&quot; cup on the 
                  Touquet Tennis-Club courts. His country was then named the U.R.S.S, 
                  and it was no question, in this period, under the Leonid Brejnev 
                  regime, to hope earning money while playing tennis. &quot;I 
                  had a good coach, but he chose to work in an other club&quot; 
                  she remembers. &quot;His departure broke me. I preferred not 
                  continuing&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Thirty years after, Marat is living per procuration, the broken 
                  dream of his mother who gave him his Arabian first-name. &quot;I'm 
                  from the Caucasian country, and Muslim&quot; she said with precision. 
                  &quot;Yes, I'm Muslim like Hicham Arazi&quot; Marat confirms 
                  &quot;But be careful, I'm not a practising! I can't with my 
                  life style&quot;. Standing in the middle of the forest, on the 
                  Spartak of Moscow courts, it's Rauza who, between the age of 
                  six and thirteen, learn him the basics of the game, and who 
                  offered him the weapon to succeed later. &quot;She has done 
                  a real good job&quot; emphasises Raphael Mensua. &quot;When 
                  he left Moscow, he had already a very complete technique&quot;. 
                  The Russian tennis will, one day, pay homage to every women 
                  who done so much for its success, during this last twenty years. 
                  Without Tatiana Naoumko, his only coach ever, perhaps Andrei 
                  Chesnokov might not be the champion he was. Without Natalia 
                  Rogova, Andrei Cherkasov would not have reach the 13th place 
                  in the world. Without the will of Alla, his mother, Anna Kournikova 
                  would not break hearts everywhere she plays. Coming from the 
                  Spartak of Moscow too, Anna Kournikova has cross, very early 
                  , the road of Marat Safin who is 16 month older than her. &quot;I 
                  played sometimes with her&quot; he confides. &quot;besides, 
                  it's with Anna and height other young player of the club, that 
                  I travelled out of Russia, for the first time. I was 10 year 
                  old. We went to Indianapolis, in the United States. There was 
                  a very rich woman, in there. She was called Barbara Wynn. She 
                  was the person who invited us. For us, who hadn't any money, 
                  it was incredible&quot;. Anna entered quickly the Nick Bolittieri 
                  academy, in Florida. His club's fellow has followed her few 
                  months later. How ? It's here that started the strange adventure 
                  of Marat Safin. Now listen to him …<br>
                  &quot;My father was friendly closed with a business man in the 
                  gymnasium club where he is still working&quot; he told him : 
                  &quot;So, I have a 12 years old son, he well plays tennis, but 
                  he won't progress if he keeps staying here. What need he do 
                  ?&quot;. &quot;This business man knew a Swiss banker who could 
                  help me. He called him, and the banker answered him that he 
                  was agree to give me few moneys. The aim was to allow me to 
                  go to the Nick Bolittieri academy. There, we had to see whether 
                  I was skilled enough to stay in there&quot;. The business man 
                  in question, was named Vladimir Sherbakov. The mysterious banker 
                  was named Bruce Rappaport and was leading the &quot;Inter Maritime 
                  Bank&quot;, in Geneva. In September, 1992, a hopeful Marat Safin 
                  is travelling so, to Bradenton in Florida. Two weeks are gone, 
                  and always no nick appearance. And suddenly, the &quot;master&quot; 
                  is announced. &quot;Nick wants to see you all on the court, 
                  near 3 PM&quot; shout the coach who has trained Marat and some 
                  of the other youngsters. &quot;He finally appeared&quot; he 
                  remember. &quot;I played 15 minutes, with my fellows, and I 
                  heard a &quot;Thank you guys&quot;, which indicates that the 
                  session was ended&quot;. Marat Safin has never seen Nick anymore, 
                  it's Alla Kournikova, the mother of Anna, installed in the academy 
                  since some months, who was in charged to deliver the though 
                  of the most famous coach in the world. &quot;Nick don't like 
                  your right-hand grip&quot;, she revealed to him. The journey 
                  in the Peru spent immediately after, to allow him to make up, 
                  will not give him the right to stay in Florida. &quot;however, 
                  In lima, I reached the semi-final&quot; he remembers. &quot;It 
                  was funny, with a coach of the academy, we were gone with a 
                  Macedonian, a Mexican, and a French which I don't remember the 
                  name. We lodged, with the Mexican, in a family. We were sleeping 
                  in the same bed. As he was always crying, I was spending my 
                  time at comforting him. Why crying ? What we were living was 
                  wonderful. Well, this was the way I felt. I was travelling, 
                  we were playing tennis, this was marvellous&quot;. Hopefully, 
                  this suffering defeat didn't slow down the mysterious banker's 
                  charity, who Marat hadn't have the opportunity to met, curiously. 
                  During the 1993's autumn, this is the Spain country which was 
                  opening wide its arms. &quot;I had to choose between Barcelona 
                  and Valencia. I went to the Bruguera academy to bring me an 
                  idea, but I stayed there only few minutes, the place didn't 
                  please me. On the contrary, in Valencia, I knew instantly, that 
                  it was the right one&quot;. It's here, in the Penasol academy, 
                  that he has met Raphael Mensua, who is now 36 years old, a former 
                  Spanish junior champion, winning the Valerio cup, and who was 
                  ranked 320 in the world. Since, the two men never quit each 
                  other, excepting a 6 months duration, in 1997. In spite of the 
                  raining tears he had because he missed his family during the 
                  first months of his installation in Spain, and because he was 
                  lost in a country where he didn't know yet the language, Marat 
                  affirms that this lap of time was the most difficult in his 
                  life. &quot;As the banker helped me financially in 1993 to 1997, 
                  he decided suddenly to stop giving me money&quot;, he revealed. 
                  &quot;I had to go back home. I felt bad, really bad. I didn't 
                  want to train anymore. I didn't touch a racquet for tree months. 
                  &quot;He was in a such bad state&quot; confirms Mensua. &quot;We 
                  was calling each other, but I was feeling that he didn't believe 
                  in it anymore&quot;. The IMG society (International Management 
                  Group) specialised, among others, in the managing of certain 
                  sporting careers, and whose founder Mark McCormack was, with 
                  strange coincidence, the friend of Bruce Rappaport, has finally 
                  saved him and advanced him 5000$. This money allowed him to 
                  play in the challenger tournament of Espinho, Mensua was there, 
                  to see his victory. Mensua came to check different points with 
                  Marat. Two month later, he was participating to his first ATP 
                  Tour tournament, in Moscow, and became 194e in the world. His 
                  career was really taken off…<br>
                  <br>
                  It took of, we know, in 1998, during a season which saw him, 
                  at the end, becoming the youngest who ever finish in the top 
                  50 in the world. There was Rolland Garros, of course, where, 
                  ranked 116e in the world hierarchy, and after taking part to 
                  the qualifying rounds, he shacked up the tournament in dominating 
                  in five sets each time, Andre Agassi, and Gustavo Kuerten, the 
                  reigning champion, with 16000 persons in the crowd. Only Cedric 
                  Pioline, who, after five enthusiastic sets, stopped the terrific 
                  adventure of Marat, but with real cost . There was the Davis 
                  cup too, with the matches against the United States in Atlanta 
                  where, in the body of an unknown person, he scared Jim Courier 
                  in the fifth and decisive match. &quot;Without this spark in 
                  the Davis Cup, I would not perhaps be so tough in Roland Garros&quot; 
                  he thinks. There was the US Open too, where he gifted himself 
                  a sixteenth final place in the US Open. But, there, Pete Sampras 
                  was too brilliant for him. &quot;I hadn't any chances against 
                  him&quot; he says with a big smile, &quot;Too tough, Sampras! 
                  For me, the tournament was already ended before the beginning 
                  of the match. My plane ticket was already reserved for the next 
                  day&quot;.<br>
                  <br>
                  It's sometimes difficult to know whether Marat Safin is serious, 
                  or is kidding. Is he telling the truth when he says that his 
                  biggest fear in 1999 is to participate to the satellite tournaments 
                  ? Is he kidding, when he says that, if he don't win a Grand 
                  Slam title, he won't be disappointed anyway. &quot;You must 
                  remind you where he is coming from&quot; soften Raphael Mensua. 
                  &quot;It's first goal is to earn money, to get financial safety, 
                  for him and for his family. Once he will do this, he will win 
                  titles and get interest in his career&quot;. Yevgeny Kafelnikov, 
                  his compatriot who advises him sometimes, didn't behave a different 
                  way, in the beginning of his career. His mind could be extremely 
                  disconcerting too.&quot; His personality is unsteady&quot; confirms 
                  Mensua. &quot;He is nice, but he is aggressive sometimes. He 
                  is very extraverted, and he could suddenly shut up for an entire 
                  day, because he is angry&quot;.<br>
                  <br>
                  Marat Safin has earned near 600 000$ price money on the court 
                  during the year 1998. The beginning of the fortune ? It don't 
                  seem to be, no luxury in the small 35 meter square furnished 
                  flat which he is renting in the 6th floor of a building of the 
                  Calle Chiva. &quot;I do the house cleaning, I wash the dishes, 
                  and I do the shopping myself. There is no woman in here&quot;. 
                  Sylvia, his girl friend, who has recently gifted him an alliance, 
                  lives, indeed, too far away, in Pamplona where she is still 
                  studying. &quot;I would by a house near&quot; he confides, &quot;and 
                  another car, this would be a dream&quot;. Thanks to his service 
                  who gets over 200 Km/h regularly, and to his powerful forehand 
                  and backhand, a Ferrari or a Porsches will soon rejoin his garage. 
                  &quot;He has the height, the physic, and the power of the modern 
                  player&quot; analyses Georges Deniau . &quot;Moreover, he wants 
                  to win, and he is not scared when he has to play decisive points, 
                  but he is not enough quick in his moves and executions&quot;. 
                  Even if his goal is to reach only the ranking 30 in the world 
                  in 1999, Safin has the weapon to burn the steps. He has already 
                  gone very quickly during this last months, with certain spectacular 
                  accidents sometimes, like in Australia. Marat Safin hasn't broken 
                  his first car yet. His racquets didn't have the same luck…<br>
