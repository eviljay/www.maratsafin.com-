                    <br>
                    Q.</b> Why are you such a good coach?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    ANDREI CHESNOKOV:</b> I am a good tennis player.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Could you perhaps tell us roughly how the new relationship 
                    with Marat came about, you know, when did it happen and why 
                    did it happen and then perhaps Marat could tell us a little 
                    bit of the impact it clearly had on him.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>ANDREI CHESNOKOV</b></font><b><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">:</font></b><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    His agent found me in Paris and asked if I can help with Marat. 
                    I got a phone call from his agent. He asked me if I can help 
                    him as a coach, and that's the way we begin together in Barcelona. 
                    I want to tell, I never did special things. Like I will never 
                    practice together for five hours, we never worked for five 
                    hours, but, you know, I think I took the great player. And 
                    the only things I can tell him, it's like something for his 
                    head during the tournament in Barcelona. And I think this 
                    guy can listen well. I think if he listens well, it's more 
                    important things.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Have you ever thought that you wanted to get into 
                    coaching, or is it just a complete surprise to you as well?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>ANDREI CHESNOKOV:</b> It's surprised me a little bit, and 
                    before, I was still playing a tournament last week. And I 
                    don't play anymore, let's say ATP tournaments, but I was always 
                    continue to play the other tournaments, and I think this offer 
                    surprised me. And I said to myself, "Okay, Marat, I know he's 
                    a nice guy and why I'm not going to try a little bit to help 
                    him." And I think he did a very good job in Barcelona, and 
                    then last weekend in Mallorca. And I said to him, you know, 
                    now you can play tennis, you don't need a coach anymore. (Laughter.)<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Can you tell us something, can you say if it's true 
                    about your new technique of hitting your pupil if he doesn't 
                    want you to order it?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>ANDREI CHESNOKOV:</b> The new technique, it's very simple 
                    today. I said to Marat, you know , we don't have too much 
                    time before the Barcelona tournament because I am arrived 
                    to Barcelona on Sunday, and one of the things...I don't want 
                    to see any results, but I want to see the man on the court, 
                    and I would like you to fight for every single point. That's 
                    the first things I said to him. But I think he listens well, 
                    and he knows the tennis and I think he was working a lot with 
                    his old coach and he has a very good potential today. He's 
                    very talented and he can play tennis.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Which do you think was his biggest problem? At which 
                    level do you think he could arrive?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>ANDREI CHESNOKOV:</b> Which level?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Yes. I mean ranking or... <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>ANDREI CHESNOKOV:</b> But, you know, the way he played 
                    until the Barcelona tournament, he should be like maybe 500. 
                    (Laughter.) But the way he played like the last two tournaments, 
                    it's No. 1 player.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Is he allowed to say some words, too?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>ANDREI CHESNOKOV: </b>Can you tell how far you can go?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Does this new technique work out of Spain or just 
                    in Spain?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> What do you mean?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> You won two small tournaments in Spain.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Excuse me, but maybe it was small tournaments 
                    for you, but to me, I won one tournament that was $325,000. 
                    The tournament in Mallorca is $500,000. There are a lot of 
                    players, Kafelnikov, Norman... Maybe for you, but... sorry, 
                    I'm not on your level now.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Marat, when did you start thinking that you might 
                    need to change your coach, and was it your idea that they 
                    spoke to Andrei?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yes, because I think we have been together 
                    a long time with Rafael. He had become not a coach, he become 
                    like a father. And it's little bit difficult to get something 
                    really high, for example, I don't know, to be in the top in 
                    rankings. It's a little bit difficult because you can't... 
                    when he's talking, sometimes you don't understand him because 
                    he's talking like a father, and he cannot understand me on 
                    the court. But out of the court, we was so close, so something 
                    -- we missed something on the court. So I said to him, "Let's 
                    try something new." I would like to know what is happening. 
                    I told him that I am going to try to work with Andrei. He 
                    said yes, he told me it is a good idea. I was sad, he was 
                    sad, but that's life because it just was business. But our 
                    relationship is still the same, and I think it's bit more 
                    important than the business. Because otherwise, if I will 
                    be with him right now, it will be first round, first round, 
                    first round, That's it. (Laughter.) We like this. I don't 
                    want to lose him -- so that was right idea I think.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Some days you play like a champion, sometimes like 
                    a 500 player. Is it some Russian attitude? Like Kafelnikov, 
                    sometimes he plays like a champion, wins a Grand Slam tournament 
                    then after for three, four weeks in a row he gets out in the 
                    first round with all the talent he has. Is it a Russian problem 
                    or just the athlete? <br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> I don't know. Ask him.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>ANDREI CHESNOKOV:</b> I would like to give the answer. 
                    First of all, about the... you said two "small" tournaments, 
                    Barcelona and -- no, no, no. Listen. Okay. For Sampras and 
                    Agassi, it's maybe like some kind of Challenger. Maybe. It 
                    could be. For him, you know, for him it's a big tournament 
                    and it was a big week in Barcelona, even in Mallorca. Because 
                    it doesn't matter who he played, you know, against the players 
                    like ranking 100 or 200. The way he played, he played great, 
                    and I think it's more important that he won these two tournaments. 
                    He got the confidence. His head is clean now and he can play 
                    tennis like a champion. And of course we don't want to stop, 
                    you know. He won the tournament. He won two tournaments. It's 
                    not our goal. I'd prefer we go forward. And the question with 
                    Kafelnikov, I don't want to see Marat on the Tour if he's 
                    going to play the way like Kafelnikov. You know, I said, okay, 
                    if you're going to win a tournament, you know, you have to 
                    be like a champion. You cannot, like, giving up the first 
                    round. No, you have to fight. You have to fight for every 
                    single point, and that makes the difference with the other 
                    players. I don't want talking about let's say especially to 
                    Kafelnikov, who played the tournament. No. Today it's not 
                    like his style and, you know, we're working to get him better. 
                    Q. What would happen if Marat acted on court the way he did 
                    at the Australian Open this year with you coaching him? At 
                    the Australian, when they fined you for... (To see related

                    the question. Go ahead.<br>

                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> First of all, I would like to say that how 
                    they put in the press and everything, it was completely different. 
                    Because nobody knows more than me. It's unbelievable how the 
                    people from the press, they know what I did.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>What did you do?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, because it was in the court almost 
                    higher, so we played almost there. Nobody was in the stand, 
                    no in the seats. It was completely empty. I don't know how 
                    the people from the press, they knew it.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>We were just told that...<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Who told you? How you can write this thing 
                    ?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>We only wrote what we were told that you were fined 
                    because of...<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Because of what?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> ...for not trying.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Okay, for not trying. How I not try?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> The ITF officials told us.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> The ITF don't have any idea.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>What was your view of what happened?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> First of all, in the press they put that 
                    I took the ball with the hand. How can you write it if you 
                    didn't see it with your eyes? How you can do it? Sorry, guys, 
                    but is not serious.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>All we could write was what they produced as an 
                    official statement. We couldn't make any comment. We have 
                    no idea whether you were at --<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Okay, so ITF, how can they do this?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> They apparently did it on the report of a supervisor, 
                    Bill Gillmore.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Okay, he's a genius. I mean why? He was 
                    on the court?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> I have no idea. He said he was.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> He was on the court?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> He said he was. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> There was only umpire, my coach and a 
                    few person more. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> I can witness that I was passing by this court and 
                    I had just a glimpse, I saw you desperately trying. I am the 
                    witness against all of those reporters, all of them. (Laughter.)<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Okay. So you can write whatever you want, 
                    okay. I'm a bad player, they put me fine $2,000, okay. I think 
                    it was good -- yes, I took the ball with th hand. Yes, I hit 
                    the ball boy also. You can put it. It's okay. There's no problem. 
                    But, no it's not your problem, it's ITF's problem. But I don't 
                    understand how people can write it. Sorry, but it wasn't like 
                    this. I'm telling to you now, it wasn't like this. You have 
                    to write this.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Did I ask you for a press conference there, I don't 
                    remember? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> You weren't asked for a press conference there in 
                    Australia?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No, because I was... sorry, but I was 
                    sad. When I read this.. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> But immediately after the match. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No, nobody asked me what happened. Sorry.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Andrei, how much are you likely to travel this year?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>ANDREI CHESNOKOV:</b> Today, I don't like to travel. Q. 
                    So are you not going to travel to a lot of tournaments or 
                    what?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>ANDREI CHESNOKOV:</b> I will, I will. If we're going to 
                    continue to working, I think I have to travel.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>We'll see you everywhere.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    ANDREI CHESNOKOV:</b> I cannot promise you. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Can he win the French Open?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    ANDREI CHESNOKOV:</b> Can he win the French Open?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>ANDREI CHESNOKOV:</b> Okay, you can go out and I give answer. 
                    I don't want you to hear this. (Laughter.) But also, I would 
                    like to say, you know, I will give you answer on this question. 
                    I said already to Marat, the way you played the tournament 
                    in let's say Indian Wells, Copenhagen, Monte Carlo, if you 
                    play the first set then if something happens, like something 
                    bad, then you give the match away. And I said it, you know, 
                    the way you played until Barcelona, you was not a man. And 
                    if you want to work together with me, you have to be on a 
                    court like a man, like Muster. Muster, he was a big fighter, 
                    even he was in a bad mood, he didn't sleep, something happened 
                    during the match, he never gave up. He played until the end. 
                    And I said to Marat, that's the way you have to play every 
                    match. Even today, he's going a bit tired after the Barcelona 
                    and Mallorca. It's not so easy to play two weeks in a row 
                    like this. I said even if he's going up 6-2, 5-Love, I would 
                    like you to play until the end. Every point, every point you 
                    will win, you will get the experience for the French Open. 
                    For the French Open, I would like him to win, you know, the 
                    big tournament like the French Open, Wimbledon, whatever. 
                    But the point is I don't know him very well. I don't know 
                    where we have to work to get -- when, where, on what case 
                    we have to work. I know what is his bad things on the court, 
                    I know he has good things on the court. But of course I would 
                    like him to win French Open. You know, every thing is possible 
                    during the two weeks in the French Open. The point is you 
                    -- it's not only you have to play well sometimes. Also, you 
                    have to be lucky sometimes during the tournament, because, 
                    you know, the level is so high today and not everybody can 
                    play well. Like Ruud last week, he played the biggest match. 
                    I never seen Ruud the way he played against Safin. And Safin, 
                    he won 7-5 in the third.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>But in your opinion, clay is his best surface? <br>
                    <b><br>
                    ANDREI CHESNOKOV:</b> I think he can play everywhere. I think 
                    he can play well everywhere because he got a good serve and 
                    also his hand is quick.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Even grass?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>ANDREI CHESNOKOV:</b> Even on grass.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Can you say something about the human being? We 
                    don't know anything about Safin like man, like guy, what sort 
                    of man he is.<br>
                    <br>
                    ANDREI CHESNOKOV: I don't know, but he's a nice guy and that's 
                    it. He's not talking badly about no one, and he has a very 
                    good relationships, I think, with everybody. And let's say 
                    big heart, I think it's very important in tennis, for the 
                    relationships.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> What do you think was the most important: To take 
                    you as a coach or to leave the other coach, in a way? Not 
                    because he was bad coach, but because it was a psychological 
                    problem at the moment.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    ANDREI CHESNOKOV:</b> I didn't know his old coach very well, 
                    and I don't want to tell anything bad about the old coach. 
                    I just want to tell something good about the old coach. Q. 
                    Thinking psychologically more than anything, he seemed to 
                    have a problem to play well when he was with him more psychologically.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    ANDREI CHESNOKOV:</b> You know, I just want to tell you then, 
                    his old coach, he created.. I think he's created a big player, 
                    you know. And I think what the main point for Marat, he needs 
                    to fix his brain. I think that was the main point, and I'll 
                    never train Marat, you know, like spend five hours on the 
                    court with Marat.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> You spoke well.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    ANDREI CHESNOKOV:</b> You know, I only had chances to give 
                    the good feeling, good sense, I don't know. I tried to tell 
                    him, you know, something to get , you know. If you will be 
                    clean in your head, even if you are in the bad shape, you 
                    can play well. That's what I was trying to tell Marat.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Are you excited by the amount of talent you see 
                    in him?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>ANDREI CHESNOKOV:</b> I think he's very talented today, 
                    and the point is if we not going to continue to working, the 
                    talent is going down like this. And...because today he only 
                    played a tournament every week, and I said to Marat if you 
                    want to be ready for the French Open, you have to like stop 
                    for one week and... <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Is he going to do that?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>ANDREI CHESNOKOV:</b> No, he's entering to play before 
                    French Open. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>He's playing Dusseldorf?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    ANDREI CHESNOKOV :</b> He's going to play Dusseldorf, but 
                    in the team, Kafelnikov and Safin, they taking the team. I 
                    said to Marat, okay, listen, I'm going to play instead of 
                    you. (Laughter.) Because I don't want you get exhausted before 
                    the French Open, and I don't want you repeat my mistakes, 
                    or any mistakes on the Tour. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Which were playing too much? <br>
                    <b><br>
                    ANDREI CHESNOKOV:</b> Let's say I said to him if you want 
                    to play well, you have to play three, four tournaments maximum, 
                    and then you have to practice for one or two weeks. Then you 
                    can improve your tennis, and we talk about the talent. You 
                    know, the talent is not only we have to be the talent in your 
                    hand, you have to be talented in your head also. If you bring 
                    two things together, talent here and talent in your head, 
                    then you can be the champion. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> If you had to play against Safin today, how you 
                    can beat him?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    ANDREI CHESNOKOV:</b> No, I don't want to beat him. I don't 
                    want to let him go on. No, no, but if you want to see this 
                    match between me and Safin, the way he play, he can beat. 
                    I don't think he's afraid to play someone else on the Tour 
                    today.<b> <br>
