                  Wednesday, December 20, 2000 <br>
                  By Barry Flatman<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The scene in Flushing Meadows' interview room after Marat Safin 
                  had explained and analysed his US Open triumph was unprecedented 
                  in tennis. Regularly a couple of cold beers are opened to celebrate 
                  a good win. Occasionally, even a magnum of champagne is cracked 
                  for the more momentous of titles. But never a whole crate of 
                  chilled Stolichnaya vodka. <br>
                  <br>
                  Then again, Marat Safin promises to be no ordinary Grand Slam 
                  champion.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin is the state-of-the-art answer to those who long have 
                  complained tennis is lacking in the sort of personalities needed 
                  to inject interest into the game. Both a clown and a rebel, 
                  he smiles, he jokes, he rages, he breaks racquets. At times 
                  he makes great show of how much he is enjoying himself on court, 
                  at others he makes no attempt at disguising his self-loathing. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Gregarious and engaging by nature, he likes to make people smile 
                  and laugh, and clearly enjoys a party ... as the vodka proved.<br>
                  <br>
                  But he also admits an ability to produce the sort of behavior 
                  which can make those who care about him wince and can never 
                  guarantee good behavior. But - and this is what really counts 
                  - the 20-year-old from Moscow happens to be a very special sort 
                  of player whose power is frightening but touch exquisite.<br>
                  <br>
                  The way he overcame Pete Sampras in straight sets in the US 
                  Open final was a memory few of those fortunate enough to be 
                  in New York that cloudy September Sunday afternoon will ever 
                  forget. Safin took on the man regarded as the very best and 
                  left him in a tattered heap. At that very moment, tennis seemed 
                  to move into a new era. <br>
                  <br>
                  "I cannot play quiet," he insists. "I have to let my feelings 
                  show. I try to say to myself don't worry but it doesn't usually 
                  work. I need to shout and throw the racquet because otherwise 
                  I get too nervous. But now I try not to go crazy too much."<br>
                  <br>
                  It had been a quarter of a century since a former US champion 
                  had suffered such a pummelling in the final. Perhaps Safin will 
                  never play so well again as he did in that 6-4 6-3 6-3 annihilation 
                  of the record-breaking winner of 13 Grand Slam titles. Many 
                  are convinced it was just the end of a first chapter in a story 
                  which could become one of the greatest in the game. <br>
                  <br>
                  Of course, those at Melbourne Park who stood court side just 
                  12 months ago as the Muscovite became the first player in Grand 
                  Slam history to be fined for not trying in his opening round 
                  exit to South Africa's Grant Stafford could be forgiven for 
                  querying whether they were watching the same player. The incident 
                  can never be totally swept under the carpet and doubtless played 
                  its part in what happened to Safin in the ensuing months.<br>
                  <br>
                  A year on he still insists he was harshly treated but cannot 
                  deny the display was symptomatic of his then disenchantment 
                  with the life of a tennis star and he needed a few forceful 
                  reminders of just what he had going for him. The skill and power 
                  were never in any doubt; the commitment at times was dubious 
                  and that was the issue to be addressed.<br>
                  <br>
                  The rebellious streak in Safin had always been there. His first 
                  coach was his mother, Rausa Islanova, who today can also be 
                  credited with starting the Olympic silver medalist Elena Dementieva 
                  on the road to stardom. But while the young girl in her charge 
                  dutifully listened to the advice, Marat was only too ready to 
                  answer back. At the age of 14, the situation got to breaking 
                  point.<br>
                  <br>
                  "I was tired of fighting with my mother and she could see I 
                  needed to go somewhere else so they put all their money in sending 
                  me to Spain," he recalled. "It was hard, very hard. I did not 
                  know anyone and could not speak the language but it taught me 
                  many things and it is probably why I have got what I have today." 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  He was schooled in the Spanish way in Valencia, a contemporary 
                  of another emerging superstar Juan Carlos Ferrero. Coached by 
                  Rafael Mensua, he finally exploded onto the world scene at the 
                  1998 French Open where, as an almost unknown, he ousted both 
                  Andre Agassi and defending champion Gustavo Kuerten. It was 
                  the sort of form guaranteed to attract the sports' most powerful 
                  men. <br>
                  <br>
                  Like Mark McCormack. The International Management Group chief 
                  was spotted at Roland Garros during the French Open, taking 
                  snap shots of Safin with his own personal instamatic camera.<br>
                  <br>
                  But the player decided against becoming another of the lengthy 
                  IMG roster and instead followed in the footsteps of Guillermo 
                  Vilas, Henri Leconte, Boris Becker and Goran Ivanisevic by linking 
                  up with that mustachioed svengali, Ion Tiriac. When the alarm 
                  bells started ringing at the beginning of last year, the wise 
                  old Romanian decided that his charge, rather than needing one 
                  overpowering coach, should begin getting advice from several 
                  people on various facets on what it takes to get to the top. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin admitted he seriously considered quitting tennis last 
                  March, so bad were the pressures building inside his head. So 
                  Tiriac first enlisted former Russian player Andrei Chesnokov, 
                  himself no conformist, to aid the youngster in the art of positive 
                  thinking. <br>
                  <br>
                  Almost immediately there was an upswing in form, with titles 
                  in Barcelona and Majorca as well as a final place in Hamburg.<br>
                  <br>
                  "I just became a fighter whereas before I was a disaster ... 
                  do you know how many matches I lost 6-0 in the second set?" 
                  recalled Safin. "I was going onto court not knowing what to 
                  do and allowing myself to get down if things didn't go well. 
                  I could not see how to change things around but Chesnokov he 
                  told me to fight and be positive. He said stop making Christmas 
                  presents of matches for the other guys. He said go out to win 
                  and sometimes if it doesn't work at least you have the thought 
                  in your head." <br>
                  <br>
                  By the time Safin reached the last eight of the French Open, 
                  he was a changed man. <br>
                  <br>
                  Englishman Tony Pickard, the man who guided Stefan Edberg throughout 
                  a noble career, was the next tutor enlisted to instruct on the 
                  nuances of grass-court tennis. When Safin journeyed across the 
                  Atlantic for the North American hard court swing, another former 
                  Russian player, Alexander Volkov, acted as his chaperone.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Masters Series title in Toronto was followed by the final 
                  in Indianapolis and then, of course, the US Open. <br>
                  <br>
                  He did not shut up shop for the year, however, adding a fifth 
                  title for 2000 just a fortnight later with victory at Tashkent, 
                  Uzbekistan. It completed a year in which he bettered US$2 million 
                  in prizemoney and entrenched himself in the top five of the 
                  world, including a stint at No.1 in September.<br>
                  <br>
                  Not bad given the year's horrendous start here in Melbourne.<br>
                  <br>
                  With 13 Grand Slam titles and six successive years at the top 
                  of the rankings, Sampras is perfectly versed with the credentials 
                  for greatness in tennis, so it is best left for the vanquished 
                  American to speculate on what exactly Safin can achieve.<br>
                  <br>
                  "He can be No.1 for many, many years to come. Together with 
                  Lleyton Hewitt he is the future. It all depends on how much 
                  he wants to do it." <br>
                  <br>
                  Of that, only one man can be sure. </font><br>
