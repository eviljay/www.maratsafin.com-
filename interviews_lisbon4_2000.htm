                    Questions for Marat. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. This tournament has ended in disappointment for you. Overall, 
                    though, you've had a fantastic year with a number of achievements. 
                    How do you assess your year? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I think it's not -- the year is not only one 
                    tournament, which it was here. Me, Guga, we played during 
                    all the year, from the beginning to the end. Of course, we 
                    get here, you are tired. Is not the same. You don't have the 
                    same feeling. Some things don't work. Probably is mental, 
                    technique is going somewhere. Impossible to play very well 
                    during all the year. It's not good to finish the year like 
                    this. I mean, Andre and Pete, they didn't play well. Pete, 
                    he didn't play at all after US Open, so he is fresh. He played 
                    a horrible match against Hewitt, but after he played a great 
                    game. Also Andre, he's been injured, as we know, since Lyon, 
                    so he had time to rest. That's why he's playing very well 
                    here. We just had no time to rest. Unfortunately, this week, 
                    it wasn't the best in my career, but I'm satisfied what I 
                    did during all the year. I'm satisfied with the game, with 
                    myself, with people, with everybody. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How did you injure your ankle? Could you tell us what the 
                    problem was? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: It happened today. Just a problem with the shoes. 
                    But it's not a big problem. It happens. But I'll be okay in 
                    two weeks. I think I can play tennis next year. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Were they the wrong sort of shoes? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: It was just a problem of shoes, too small. I 
                    don't know how to say it. From here, it's not wide enough 
                    (indicating at his heel). Not wide enough. That's the problem. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Were they gripping the surface too hard? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Anyway, nothing happened. Going to change the 
                    shoes. I will tell please to adidas to change the shoes. It 
                    will be great. I don't think they're going to complain about 
                    this. Just everybody -- to every player, you have to put the 
                    right shoes. Somebody has to wear different shoes. It will 
                    be okay. It was a small accident. It's over. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. But is your ankle injured, swollen? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I will survive, for sure. It's going to be okay 
                    (smiling). <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Have you been wearing the same shoes all week, the same 
                    type of shoe? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but I didn't run so much like today (laughter). 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Where are you going from here? Are you going to Valencia 
                    or Moscow? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Moscow. I want to go there. I will just spend 
                    a few days, few weeks with my family and with my friends, 
                    enjoy my life. It's getting better and better each time. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Are you going to Spartak? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Unfortunately, not. I can't, for some reasons. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Why? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: It's too far. It's too far. I am too lazy. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You had four chances to break Agassi in the second game. 
                    You couldn't convert them. How much did it affect your game 
                    afterwards? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Enough. I lost very easy. Just probably if I 
                    -- if, if, if, all the time if. If I would break, I would 
                    change a little bit the game. Anyway, I didn't had any more 
                    chances than the second game in the first set. Andre, he played 
                    too good. He was too fast. He played very fast. He played 
                    great, what can I say? I can't play like this way, fighting 
                    for No. 1. Actually, No. 1 cannot play like this, without 
                    serve, without putting pressure in some moments. Is difficult 
                    to beat these kind of players. Probably I'm not satisfied 
                    with my game this afternoon. I'm happy and I'm satisfied enough 
                    with the game of this whole year. I served well, but something 
                    just changed in my serve. It doesn't matter. Just I didn't 
                    serve well. That's it. That was the problem. To play against 
                    these guys, you have to serve, that's it. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Did the talk about you having the chance to reach No. 1 
                    bother you and annoy you over the last couple days? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I don't think it's already nobody get nervous 
                    on the court. Everybody's playing here. Everybody has enough 
                    level to play and beat the top guys. I think yesterday I didn't 
                    play at all, for some reasons, I don't know. I still don't 
                    understand why I don't play. Today, he was too good. I didn't 
                    serve well. I don't think it's the problem of thinking that 
                    I can be No. 1. Everything going to come. The numbers are 
                    going to come. You have to show your game. If the game is 
                    there, the numbers will come from both sides. I hope Pete 
                    going to make my job. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Are you going to see the game? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No, I will watch it on TV. Let's see what going 
                    to happen. I mean, we'll see who is the best, if Guga going 
                    to win, good luck in the final. He deserve it. If he's No. 
                    1, he won more things, more tournament. Just he's better than 
                    me, that's it. You have to accept. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Are you going to stay here tomorrow to see the final? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yes, uh-huh. I saw enough tennis already this 
                    year. I want to go home. I don't want to see any more tennis 
                    at least until next year. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. This tournament is unique because of the round-robin and 
                    also because of the high standard of the matches. Because 
                    of that, it's totally different from the other tournaments. 
                    Do you think it helps if you already played it once or twice? 
                    Does experience matter in this tournament? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Experience? Of course. I mean, the guys like 
                    Andre and Pete, they spend ten times here. They came away 
                    from Masters ten times. They like going to the hometown tournament. 
                    For them it's very easy to go out there and make a great game 
                    and play a hundred percent. We are the juniors, as everybody 
                    knows. We still juniors for Pete, for Andre. It's a little 
                    bit different, a little bit tough to go there because people, 
                    they expect a lot from you. They coming, they want to see 
                    real tennis. It's tough. Also the players are not that different. 
                    Is not anymore easy rounds. Everybody's here to win the tournament. 
                    Everybody going to fight and show his best game here. Of course, 
                    it's tough. But that's life. Nobody has an easy life. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You said you didn't serve well. Was this because you couldn't 
                    push off on your injured ankle? It looked like that. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I didn't serve well already for two or three 
                    weeks. I have to work more. At least there is something in 
                    your technique that you have to improve. I'm happy of it that 
                    I have to improve something, otherwise the game gets boring. 
                    I will improve it for next year. <br>
                    <br>
