            After thoughts on Ahoy!! <br>
            </b> 18-24 February 2002<br>
            <br>
            Well back home again in Spain and the temperatures are a healthy 24C 
            at midday - quite a change from Rotterdam. Though I must admit Rotterdam 
            did show its good side and then on my final day threw everything at 
            me just to prove that it could be bad!<br>
            <br>
            Now that we have the weather out of the way - maybe we should talk 
            on the tennis that was almost sidelined and thrown a curve ball by 
            the &quot;Rotterdam Flu&quot;!<br>
            <br>
            But I had no idea of any of this when I set out on Friday the 15th 
            February. Had a very early start of 6am and had a lot of traveling. 
            When I arrived at Rotterdam Centraal Station - the sun was shining 
            and although cold - it was a beautiful late afternoon so I walked 
            to the hotel!! No fancy arriving in the official Renault cars. But 
            neither did Marat or Yevgeny - they hired cars at Schipol and drove 
            to the hotel.<br>
            <br>
            The hotel was excellent - the staff are all very friendly and so were 
            the drivers and the two ladies Kirsteen and Trisha on the tennis transport 
            desk. All made me feel very much at home. And the mints on the desk 
            were consumed by all!<br>
            <br>
            Lots of people have asked what is it like to be in the same hotel 
            as the players. Like being in a hotel with a lot of people you know 
            by sight - some are friendly and greet you or smile in acknowledgement 
            - others ignore you. Basically players, coaches, trainers and all 
            are there, doing a job and they get on with it. Yes they have all 
            the comforts - that's part of what the sponsors provide for them - 
            but it is still another town and another week of practice, to &amp; 
            fro to the practice courts, back after massage, etc and then to your 
            room for another quiet night. Some go out in a group such as all the 
            French together for a quick dinner - others to a movie to relax as 
            with Thomas Johansson and his coach (the coach is a really nice guy 
            had great fun with him trying to find the paper where I had seen all 
            the details of what movies were showing and times) but there is no 
            rip roaring partying as people tend to think. They might meet together 
            in each others' rooms but I saw a lot of players walking around with 
            a book in hand or walkman with their favourite music to keep them 
            company. Some like Tim Henman and YK always come into breakfast clutching 
            the paper to read.<br>
            <br>
            And to the watcher - me - lots of time spent reading a book in the 
            hotel lobby and waiting for that one person to make an appearance. 
            As I love watching people - it is no hardship - you can learn so much 
            from the people around you. When you are a Marat <br>
            Safin fan - you get used to waiting - definitely not an early person 
            Marat except sometimes like on the Sunday he got up early and practiced. 
            In fact I remarked - you are out early and I was told &quot;some of 
            us have to work!!&quot;<br>
            <br>
            Ahoy stadium is quite far from the hotel and expensive by taxi. Went 
            by Subway with Saskia but didn't try it by myself - it was easier 
            to just get in a taxi - especially when late at night. It is a great 
            complex and I was pleasantly surprised that, although there is the 
            usual conglomeration of all the best seats in the front for the sponsors 
            - the seats for the general public are actually quite close and you 
            have a wonderful view. Court 1 is great and a real chance to get close 
            to your favourite player. At least there you have a chance to get 
            your photo taken and get your programme or ticket signed. Practice 
            is a problem - the staff has been told - NO ONE - repeat NO ONE - 
            goes near the practice courts - and as Claudia said even Marat's friends 
            were kept away! Otherwise the staff is very friendly and helpful, 
            although a lot of them have no idea about tennis as I found out when 
            coming from Court 1 after Marat's doubles and trying to find out what 
            the result was between YK and IL. My one gripe - I wish that Ahoy 
            would introduce a system of TV screens showing all match results and 
            the current situation on matches. Was very difficult to know what 
            was going on Court 1 when sitting on Centre Court or vice versa. As 
            Philips provide the TV system and I am an ex Philip's employee maybe 
            I should complain!<br>
            <br>
            Then of course there was the dreaded flu! One minute Thomas Enqvist 
            was strutting down the catwalk on Ladies Day and then he had flown 
            home after winning his first match! <br>
            <br>
            All around in the hotel, players were coughing and spluttering and 
            I think another reason why they were not sitting in the bar together 
            - they were all trying to avoid the dreaded bug. <br>
            <br>
            As to the tennis and Marat - well it was really great to get given 
            the ticket for his two singles matches - it was great meeting Sergei 
            at last and now knowing the person behind all the hard work on the 
            site - and also meeting with the fans Saskia and Claudia and Joes 
            and Marjolain who admitted that it was her sister who is the Marat 
            fan and then suddenly when he walked past on Court 1 - wow she didn't 
            realize how beautiful he is - she's in love - a new convert to the 
            Marat Safin fan club - hey you didn't realize that was my job - going 
            round promoting Marat and getting new converts to the cause!! Just 
            kidding!!<br>
            <br>
            Was it worth it - YES a hundred times over. Funny I am a nervous wreck 
            before he plays and when he is on court - not so much at the doubles 
            because that was fun - but seeing him in the hotel - I am so calm 
            - you wouldn't believe it was the same person.<br>
            Thoughts on Marat's tennis - he is playing well - as I said the match 
            against Hrbaty wasn't pretty but it was effective - he won. No histrionics 
            either - just Marat cross with himself because he couldn't convert 
            the break points he had. The doubles on Tuesday - Marat and Escude 
            relaxed with each other - having fun and practicing the volleys and 
            the crosscourt shots. Then Wednesday - I truly believe Marat was already 
            coming down with the flu - how else to explain the inexplicable easy 
            start to the first set and then the total collapse - nothing would 
            go right - considering on Friday he had a temperature of 40C - anything 
            is possible. And then after Amit had gone home Thursday morning very 
            full of flu himself - Marat makes the time to sign the posters for 
            me and then goes to play when he was probably already ill. And spending 
            time to sign and sign and have photos taken. Those photos show a man 
            who was not well.<br>
            <br>
            I think the thing that amazes me is that although Marat must see thousands 
            of different people he does acknowledge and recognize people and remembers 
            certain things - like I always make a mess up of my photos! <br>
            <br>
            Little things to remember from the week - Monday sitting next to Scheng 
            Schalken's sister and mother watching him lose his match. His sister 
            remarked he never loses his temper - always so calm and then in the 
            second set he was shouting at himself and smashing his racquet on 
            the ground - just shows sisters don't always know their brothers. 
            Another nice person Scheng's wife - always greeting people and smiling! 
            Fabrice Santoro always with a shy smile, when he said hello in the 
            morning in the breakfast room. Tommy Robredo's coach - always a &quot;Buenas 
            Dias&quot; in the morning and a smile.Grosjean always with mobile 
            to his ear and hair all over the place - never combed it first thing 
            in the morning! Larry Stefanki and Tim Henman late for the transport 
            - Kirsteen was strict - on the hour and ? hour - so when they were 
            3 minutes late - Larry apologized. YK an hour late on his birthday 
            - came down and I said about time - you have to play soon. Already 
            4 in the small vehicle so YK lay across the tennis kit in the back 
            just to get to the stadium! And Wally his trainer was left behind 
            - he had gone upstairs to find YK after waiting an hour for him to 
            appear.<br>
            <br>
            Marat asking for olive oil and being brought a big bottle - is that 
            all you have - no small bottle!! On the Wednesday night downstairs 
            a smile and a wink and then off upstairs!<br>
            <br>
            On the Saturday Saskia arrived and Marat came downstairs as she arrived. 
            In his big coat - need to go to Amsterdam - can't fly today because 
            my head- fly early tomorrow! Very careful - checks his bill thoroughly 
            and checked with his two friends obviously about things they had while 
            he was ill!! Then as it was snowing outside - pulled his coat up to 
            cover his head and went outside! The smile goodbye - even though ill 
            still ever the charmer to set a woman's heart on fire!<br>
            <br>
            Go well in the States Marat! <br>
            <br>
