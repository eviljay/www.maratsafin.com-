            <br>
            Hi, everybody.<br>
            Actually it would be too early to start but beginning of my trip to 
            MC was extremely pleasant. Most of the time I’m very unlucky with 
            passengers who is sitting next to me. Regardless of what class I travel 
            I’m always get stuck with any kind of weird or unpleasant people. 
            But this time (Singapore-Bangkok-Copenhagen) I’ve been sitting next 
            to businessman from Indonesia who loves to play tennis and his son 
            (according to him) promising 13 year old junior whose favorite player 
            happened to be Andy Roddick – I’m not kidding. By the way father doesn’t 
            like Safin (my favorite player) but despite this we didn’t fight but 
            had a very pleasant conversation about tennis and other stuff. It 
            was my best flight ever. On the relatively short (about 2 hours flight) 
            from Denmark to Nice was on the same flight with Vinciguerra –dressed 
            very casually and wearing very dirty tennis hat which he didn’t remove 
            even inside the plane. By the way looks much better than on TV (usual 
            case IMO with tennis players men or women). He flies by business class 
            had a long talk with coach – just next to me but unfortunately in 
            Sweden. Seems were talking about DC math in Russia. A lot of time 
            mentions Safin, Enqvist, Kafelnikov, Bjorkman. <br>
            Another pleasant thing – I’ve met MS fan (MSF) (I’m sure some of you 
            - Susan, Denise – know her). It wasn’t by luck – we arranged to meet 
            at Nice airport to go to hotel together since our flights were arriving 
            at the same time. But it was very nice to meet this lovely lady who 
            is in addition a tennis fan (and Marat’s fan as well) during my first 
            moments in France. By the way whether which was pretty bad for the 
            past week also improved - it is not so cold anymore and afternoon 
            was sunny. <br>
            When we arrived to hotel my room wasn’t ready. MSF has decided to 
            go for the last session of qualifications and hoping to see some practice 
            sessions (and she did – see report posted by Denise). I decided to 
            stay in the lobby and wait for my room – felt a bit tired, whole trip 
            door to door” took me about 25 hours.<br>
            Watching players walking in and out not my idea of fun but since no 
            choice…<br>
            Pioline with wife (very pretty blonde IMO) and too very cute kids, 
            Federer&quot;s coach (sorry bad with names) was waiting for him to 
            come down. Looks like a very friendly guy, talked to everybody, a 
            lot of laughs, JMG coming back after practice, wearing long sleeved 
            Adidas shirt (it is cool outside), may be Marat going to wear one 
            as well? Paradon Srichapan (sorry if misspelled) coming after practice 
            and had a friendly conversation with Blake who was going to courts 
            (looks great but surprisingly skinnier than on TV). Federer left for 
            practice court and now coach of Haas (sorry can’t remember name) waiting 
            for his pupil. A lot of players walking around – Zabaleta, Pavel, 
            Stoltenberg, Tarango (in Bermuda shorts and shirtless – looks completely 
            out of place in the lobby of this hotel, but seems can’t care less) 
            and a lot of others (even Kim K – not exactly an ATP player but…) 
            Haas heading for practice court and boy, he is looking great (note: 
            I’m not a gay). Finally my room is ready – can have a bit of rest 
            and set up internet connection before dinner with MSF.<br>
            Well dinner was great and seeing a few players around (like YK who 
            was having late meal) also helped.<br>
            In the lift on the way to our rooms we were together with Kim and 
            Lleiton, MSF wished them good luck and Hewitt politely said “Thank 
            You” - they staying at the same floor with me, see them fooling around 
            before going to the room. Looks like normal teenagers in love, nice.<br>
            Feel a bit guilty not going to see practicing – but in my experience 
            too much tennis in a week ahead can make you tired of it, must be 
            very selective but how to be? Even tomorrow a lot of top people not 
            playing still Chela/Enqvist, Arazi/Clement, Henman/JMG, Santoro/Kiefer, 
            Norman/Johansson, Costa/Blake. Novak, Lapentti, YK, Federer, Mirnyi, 
            Malisse, Ljubicic, Schalken , Pavel also playing. Even have some business 
            to attend to, hopefully will do better tomorrow and will be able to 
            talk about tennis, not players only.<br>
            Best Regards <br>

            <br>
            Hi. Everybody. <br>
            My apology didn’t post my report yesterday – was very busy with my 
            own staff. Tried to e-mail a lot of pictures taken but since I’m using 
            GSM modem it is not fast enough and I couldn’t” do it. Will try again 
            later, if not – only after I’m back. I’m in the rush to go to see 
            Marat’s match so it will be short. Had breakfast in the hotel restaurant 
            – a lot of players there. Next to my table Rosset, Santoro, wife of 
            Escude, next to in Marat with Amit (with his bag – ready to go for 
            practice. Time 9AM), Spanish guys seating together, Moya, Martin, 
            Portas. YK came down, said hello to Marat, and had a small talk, laugh. 
            Later Rosset was talking to Marat for a while. Very friendly atmosphere, 
            a lot of players with kids. BTW yesterday saw Silvestre (MU soccer 
            team defender) with family, sign a lot of autographs.. After breakfast 
            walked to the Country club – 10 min. Weather in the morning was perfect 
            – cool but sunny (but later nor sun and quite cold). First went to 
            2nd court watch a first set of Johansson – Norman. Catch a bit of 
            Blake and Lapentti warming up together. Beginning – Norman had two 
            straight. No sign of injury, great preparation (never seen anybody 
            else who bend knees so much, going under the ball), typical play of 
            claycorter, a lot of heavy top spin shots TJ couldn’t find a way to 
            deal with and even he started to play better still set went to MN 
            6:2. First set TJ played like on the hard court – a lot of flat shots, 
            not patient to stay in the point, a lot of sloppy drop shots or bad 
            slice approaches. MN playing far behind the base, even receiving serves 
            staying 1-2 meters behind the base (even on second serve). Two countrymen 
            but what a contrast in style. Wanted to watch Chela playing but decided 
            to go and see practice courts, a lot of people around one of it – 
            Wodbridge and Bjorkman about to finish their practice and on the next 
            Marat practicing with Harbty. Amit their getting balls ready. Rosset 
            sitting on the bench, observing. They are playing training match and 
            Marat lost it. Few times not happy with his shots – swore in Russian 
            quite loudly, kick one ball far out of court. People who waiting for 
            their turn to practice (Coria, Portas, JMG) are watching. Once game 
            is over Marat appeared to be happy, chatted with DH and later long 
            talk with Rosset. Seems like Rosset helping in a way as a coach at 
            this moment. If so – good for Marat, definitely a better choice compare 
            to Amit. Hrbty left earlier and mobbed by young fans but most of them 
            waiting for Marat who is taking his time. He is out and surrounded 
            by fans looking for autographs, security man accompanying him has 
            to make way but not before M signing for a few people. Saw Malissie 
            walking with his female company to another practice court. Wanted 
            to catch end of Chela’s match but it is just over. On the monitor 
            see TJ leading 4:1 in the 2nd set – looks like going to be a 3 set 
            match – bad for Norman, not enough matches yet. Went to centre court 
            to watch Arazi and Clement. Not too much power but a lot of fine touches 
            esp. Arazi, long games but atmosphere on the other courts better – 
            so close to the players. And decided to go and see “boring Swedes” 
            again. 5:6 in the 2nd, MN serving to stay in the set. Tie break – 
            TJ a bit lucky, set to him. Third set – Norman has no more gas left 
            and TJ cruising to victory. But for sure MN is back and with few more 
            matches will be very dangerous on clay. Went to court No3 Blake playing 
            against Costa. A couple of groups with Spanish and American flags 
            and quite vocal. Just watched a few games and had to go for a meeting 
            – nor more tennis for me for Monday, too bad. Every player I mention 
            – taken a few pictures, it is quite a lot already Tuesday morning, 
            just went for breakfast 7:30AM (time difference, can’t sleep). Only 
            a few players there – Hrbty, Pavel, Santoro with his baby (but without 
            wife) – seems like a very friendly guy, I smiled at his cute son and 
            he FS smiled back and say Hi. Well, time for me to go – want to be 
            early. Again so many great matches today – hard to choose. Hopefully 
            will be able to spend more time today watching tennis. Best Regards

            04.16.2002</b><br>
            <br>
            Hi, everybody.<br>
            I’m early today. Too bad – once I was ready to watch matches to the 
            end it starts raining and play was suspended.<br>
            When I was heading to Monaco Country Club this morning I’ve noticed 
            a lot of people going. I never seen any other tournaments that second 
            day already has almost full stands. Guess there are two reasons – 
            too many people here in Monaco not really having a day jobs and so 
            many interesting matches today.<br>
            Came to central court early, about 9:20 and watched Coretja and Santoro 
            practicing. Santoro looked more relaxed while Alex was really serious 
            about every shot. Forgotten to mention weather was almost perfect 
            – sun, no wind but a bit wet after night. So 10PM Marat and Robredo. 
            Two thoughts before match – Marat return will be a key since it wasn’t 
            very strong since SF of AO and can’t understand all this talk about 
            Robredo “rising star – so far couldn’t see any star quality (tennis 
            wise).<br>
            Please forgive me if there is any incorrect technical information 
            – I didn’t take any notes and watching live (not live on TV) always 
            emotionally more involving for me.<br>
            Warm Up – nothing special, Marat has been hitting more volleys than 
            usual IMO.<br>
            Robredo had to serve first. Both started quite slow, Marat gave two 
            break points on his first service game. Overall first set was like 
            two claycourters from 30-50 ATP ranking are playing. Marat couldn’t 
            find his range, a lot of short balls which gave a number of opportunities 
            to Robredo to attack. Not a strong serving on the 1st, but second 
            serve was better. Marat was either late or early to position himself 
            for the shot, a lot of easy misses. Especially forehand was quite 
            bad not aggressive, esp. on returns. Really nothing impressive. Serving 
            at 4:5 30:0 lost next 4 points to give a set to Robredo. It looked 
            like he is heading for disaster and beginning of the 2 set wasn’t 
            better – Robredo hold his serve and broke Marat. Next game – if I’m 
            not wrong 7 breakpoint opportunities for Marat, but he failed to take 
            it, partly courageous play from Robredo to blame. Maybe this made 
            him angry but from that moment we started to see completely different 
            Marat. With every game difference in class became more and more noticeable. 
            Marat started to play really aggressive, going for winners, coming 
            to the net more often (btw even at the first set he looked very comfortable 
            at the net), forehand started working, powerful serving on the 1st, 
            good variety on the second (different pace, few great kick serves). 
            And now shots from Robredo started to land short. Marat hold his serve, 
            broke Robredo easily, consolidated break, serving two aces in a row 
            to get himself into driving seat. After this broke Robredo twice and 
            hold his own serve. Third set – story continued – early break from 
            Marat, Robredo didn’t drop his game – he was at the same level all 
            the time but Marat's game was going up after 0:3 in the 2nd. Robredo 
            tried everything – lob which Marat got and hit a very soft, almost 
            drop shot to get a point, drop shot – Marat got it and hit a beautiful 
            drop shot winner himself, fantastic passing shot which Marat got with 
            diving volley winner in Becker’s style – I think after that Robredo 
            knew he has no chance and resign to his fate.<br>
            In the interview after match on the court Marat didn’t say anything 
            special – normal politically correct staff.<br>
            When he wasn’t doing well in the beginning thrown his racket a couple 
            of times, hit the ball extremely high in frustration after a bad miss, 
            did a bit of screaming but without bad language, couple of times entertain 
            spectators with his soccer skill. In the third set when Robredo return 
            Marat’s serve (which was called out) with lob Marat pulled his pocket 
            and let the ball get inside – newer seen anything like this before 
            and public loved it. <br>
            Marats box – opposite. There a few people but no Amit, recognized 
            only Gerard.<br>
            Sorry guys just got news they going to start playing ageing – going 
            to the club again, post the rest of reports later.<br>
            Best regards.<br>

            <b>04.17.2002</b><br>
            Hi,<br>
            Forgotten to mention Marat’s medical timeout to treat blister on his 
            foot and couple of times doctor came to put plaster on Robredo’s thumb 
            (no time out). BTW comments by Catt about bad line calls and frustration 
            about this from Marat are TOTALLY UNTRUE, just nonsence.<br>
            Here is rest of action.<br>
            After Marat’s match weather started to change – clouds from mountains, 
            a bit windy, cold. Went to see Andy play against Gonzalez but court 
            was so pack and a lot of people are waiting to go so I went back to 
            watch Rios against Santoro (sorry guys on RR, but today Andy on the 
            centre court before Marat (unless they change schedule since yesterday 
            evening) and I will see his match for sure. BTW seems Andy/Gonzalez 
            was a very interesting match unlike Rios/Santoro which was pretty 
            much one sided. Santoro of course was usual self with all his tricks, 
            touches and spins but Rios matched him, but had more power, hit as 
            usual unbelievable angles. One point he was on defensive and hit 6 
            consecutive shots which touched the sidelines – it was unbelievable. 
            Compare to Marat, for instance, he looked much faster with his court 
            movements even his knee still taped. To disappointment of the local 
            fans match went to Rios very quickly.<br>
            Next - Hewitt/Moya. Started to drizzle a little. Hewitt looked a bit 
            pale, I thought he may be not feeling well, appeared a bit not as 
            determinated as usual, still hit a few great passing shots and I confirmed 
            to myself impression I had from watching his this year matches on 
            TV – he is definitely hitting the ball harder than before. Wet clay 
            also wasn’t in his favor, it has slowed balls down noticeably and 
            to run, change directions on clay the way he do on other surfaces 
            are not easy since it is a bit slippery to start movement. But Moya 
            was at his best – very solid tennis, confident serving, great forehands 
            winners. He took the first set but at the beginning of the second 
            it started to rain quite heavily and after about 20 minuets I’ve decided 
            to go back to the hotel since rain didn’t stop.<br>
            Later once I learnt that matches started again a decided to go back. 
            I managed to catch Grosjean/Mark P. It started at 8PM, dark, wet, 
            cold (I think about 10 deg C). Central court was filled about 5% only. 
            People who stayed were keeping themselves warm with beer and some 
            more there are Frenchman on the court – crowd was making so much noise 
            during breaks – more than whole packed stands in the morning. Grosjean 
            played with his leg taped under his shorts, but has been moving well. 
            Great serves, very good, deep ground strokes – very solid play. Mark 
            – serves as usual but on the wet clay it wasn’t so effective. On ground 
            strokes he was trying to hit very very hard, really going for too 
            much. About 40% of such shots were going out, the rest Grosjean managed 
            to return using pace from the Mark’s shot and have been giving Mark 
            a lot of trouble, hitting more winners than him. Mark has been trying 
            to talk himself into the match but still has been playing the same 
            game and things didn’t change. He lost first set, when I left it was 
            4:3 to Grosjean and he had a break. But it looked like he decided 
            to relay on his service games to close this match without extra efforts 
            and wasn’t running after shots on a few service games from Mark. I 
            thought it can be dangerous tactic esp. with player like Mark. I left 
            because it was getting very could and I couldn’t take it anymore. 
            On the way back looked at the stands of second court (match Kiefer/Savolt) 
            – no more than 20 spectators (incl. players teams) – I think if they 
            put yesterday afterrain matches in the morning section even on smaller 
            courts it would be more people watching.<br>
            Went for dinner in the hotel restaurant. In the bar – Paradon S, another 
            table Tarango Next table – Escude with his wife and daughter and Clement, 
            wife and baby left about 10:30, but guy has continued to drink beer 
            – I think each had at least 5 glasses. Later split the bill. About 
            11PM Grosgean came straight from the court to have a quick bite and 
            Santoro came down the same time. Looks like a close group of friends 
            – no wonder they doing so well in DC as a team.<br>
            About the same time Federer came back to the hotel from outside with 
            a couple of friends who don’t look like tennis players and said hello 
            to them, sit at the bar and when I left at about 11:15 doesn’t look 
            like he was about to go back to his room.<br>
            This morning had an early breakfast – a lot of double players E.Ferreira, 
            Nestor, Hill, Orsanic, Shimada. Singles – Corretja came about 7:30, 
            smiled to everybody, looked very happy. <br>
            Just read about Marat’s next opponent – wonder boy from France, 15 
            years old only. Got to the main draw with WC trough qualification 
            and beat Squillari in the first round. Nothing much about him besides 
            5.9 tall, good one handed backhand, one final in the Challenger tournament, 
            both parents are tennis coaches. I think crowd not going to be on 
            his side. <br>
            That’s all I guess. The weather is fine at this moment (hope it is 
            not going to be like yesterday). Going to the club to see players 
            warming up, then want to see Chela/Arazi on the 2nd court and than 
            to the central – Andy/Ulirach and Marat/Gasquet.<br>
            Sorry, but seems I will be able to post photos only when I’m back 
            home. What a pity – I hoped You can see it the same day it taken but 
            connection in this hotel is bad and no way I can do it via GSM modem. 
            BTW I’m not reading any comments on the board so excuse me if I’m 
            repeating information or not responding to some messages – I will 
            do it only when I’m back. If you have something urgent or important 
            to say – feel free to contact me directly.<br>

            <b>04.17.2002<br>
            </b><br>
            Hi, Everybody.<br>
            Sorry, I’m late again.<br>
            About yesterday.<br>
            Decided to watch Chela/Arazi (instead of central court Gaudenzi/Corretja) 
            but went to the central court to see who is practicing – Andy (bright 
            red t-shirt, normal tennis hat, not a visor) hitting with Tarik (still 
            can hit very well). Just took a few pictures and went to the second 
            court. Arazi was about to finish his warm up, very serious, hit a 
            few very hard serves and left to prepare for his match in half in 
            hour time. Watched Dupuis practicing with his double’s partner Mathieu 
            and enjoyed the sun before the match started.<br>
            I wanted to watch it for two reason – Chela doing well this year, 
            looks impressive on TV with his baseline game and Arazy is such a 
            tricky player so should very contrasting style. Well, I don’t know 
            what happened to Arazi – he decided to try to match Chela from the 
            base without any variation and kept doing it for the whole match. 
            He has no chance at all! And it was so obvious that even when the 
            ball lend short, middle of the court for Chela to finish it off he 
            never look comfortable in such situation and made a number of mistakes. 
            But Arazy refused to try and do it on propose but instead took it 
            on his racquet which was flying a few times and finally broken by 
            the end of the first set. Chela looked great from the base, hit a 
            lot of semi-open or open forehands (but his movement doesn’t look 
            as excessive as Roddick’s), a lot, a lot of winners from behind the 
            base (and it is on clay!), very aggressive returns. Very good first 
            serve. Weak points – very uncomfortable once have to move inside the 
            court, looked out of place there, very weak second serve. But besides 
            his strokes what really impressed me – his ability to play whiting 
            his strength, patience with creating opportunity, very good discipline 
            with shot selection. Match lasted less than an hour and I went to 
            the central court - Corretja and Gaudenzi haven’t finished the first 
            set yet! I’m not a big fan of any of this two players (but I like 
            A.C. personality) A.G. muscles ball which usually doesn’t look that 
            nice. As for AC – just don’t know why. But have to admit he slides 
            beautifully to the ball on clay – now you can see less and less of 
            it from young players, game getting too fast for it. Corretja won 
            but it was great fight from Gaudenzi. <br>
            Next Roddick/Ulihrach.<br>
            Never been a big fan of Andy, saw him playing live only once – Stuttgart 
            MS last year and it wasn’t interesting to me but my impression on 
            him quite different after this match and I will explain to You why.<br>
            In no time Andy found himself down a break 1:4. Give a break with 
            attempt to drop shot after BU return his serve quite aggressively. 
            Shout loudly “What am I doing?!” Next game 3 UE from U and ace 4:2.<br>
            A lot of slice backhand shots from him, forehand not working, serving 
            also not there, bad drop shots which btw has been landing close to 
            the service line for the whole match and usually it was easy for B.U. 
            to get it<br>
            Get a break point with a few UE from U, setting it up with good lob 
            volley but failed to convert – good play from U. U plays a lot of 
            accurate precise shots down the lines. <br>
            Love service game from Andy 3:5. U serving for the set and chocked. 
            Very nervous play from him, a lot of UEs, Andy got a break back. Another 
            love service game from Andy with two aces – 5:5. 6:5 Andy break U 
            who is still upset with himself (3 double fault in this game, Andy 
            didn’t have to work hard for it). Now Andy serving for the set and 
            lost his serve! Doesn’t look like he is chocking but more like sloppy 
            and no expecting opponent’s return taking own god serve for granted.<br>
            Tie break. 3:4, first 7 points minibreaks (3 DF from Andy)! Andy facing 
            set point at 4:6, screaming “unbelievable!” after UE in the long rally. 
            Saved one with FH out wide winner. UE from U – 6:6. Now UE on the 
            slice from Andy – another set point to U. Good volley winner to save 
            it and another good winner on the FH to set up a set point for himself. 
            Great effort from AR – managed to get a good DS from U and later reached 
            a ball on the lob from U to smash a winner. First set to Andy after 
            56 min.<br>
            Second set – U have a break in the first game. Great passing cross 
            court shot from him to get it. Nervous service game from him but managed 
            to consolidate break. Andy holds his serve and breaks back. Was a 
            bit lucky on the breakpoint. Next game was up 40:15 but good play 
            from U and own UEs give BP to U which Andy saved with another sloppy 
            DS and managed to hold – 3:2. Confident service game from U 3:3. Both 
            a bit nervous in the next couple of games, Andy’s FH started to work 
            again but 1st serve is not there. 5:5. Love service game from Andy, 
            good first serves 6:5, Love game from U – tie break Very confident 
            play from Andy, UEs from U, Win it with successful long baseline rally 
            (which he hardly did during the whole match). As Andy mentioned in 
            his post match interview on court – wasn’t a pretty match, also mentioned 
            that Tarik is great on clay and he has learned a few tricks from him.<br>
            As you can see for yourself – very nervous, unstable tennis from both. 
            At the end, Andy had a little bit more power, speed and luck but in 
            his next match it won’t be enough.<br>
            After this match I somehow started to like him more. I always thought 
            he is a good guy, I respect the way he handled last year loss in USO 
            to Hewitt. But now I realized he is just a teenager, not as mature 
            as some other guys at his age and there is nothing wrong with it. 
            Actually I find him to be very “cartoon” if I can put it this way. 
            He is funny somehow. You know, when he has screamed during match everybody 
            laughs, even it is anger it is still funny. Not like other players, 
            when Marat screaming for instance it is not funny at all.<br>
            Sorry if my comment a bit messy – I have so much to write but short 
            of time.<br>
            Next – Marat/Gasquet. Central court is almost full.<br>
            No way Marat can loose it. 15 years old is a bit too early.<br>
            I don’t want to go down how the match went by games, gust impression.<br>
            Marat took it seriously, appeared very focused. But like yesterday 
            was a bit passive, shots deep but not very accurate, in the first 
            set G hardly managed to put the 1st serve in but Marat failed to take 
            advantage of it. He gave 8 BP opportunities to G which he failed to 
            convert and make 1 break (from two opportunities) himself. Went down 
            0:40 while serving for the set but played big and served well to take 
            a first set after 48’.<br>
            1st game of the 2nd set – love game from G, great variety of shots, 
            Marat looked frustrated.<br>
            Love service game in return with all type of winners – FH cross court, 
            volley, service, DS. <br>
            From this moment Marat raised game level, plays very aggressive (same 
            as his previous match) and you can see a difference between young 
            talent and top player. It is not that G just gave it up but even he 
            has hit some unbelievable shots it is not enough. Second set finished 
            in about 20 min only. Marat’s game it the second set was pretty convincing 
            but a few words about Gasquet – I don’t know if it genes or proper 
            teaching but his strokes very clean, fluid, beautiful, really GREAT 
            pleasure to watch. His one handed BH is a pure beauty, he is fast, 
            preparing early for the shots, can generate tremendous racquet speed, 
            cover court well, volleys well, positions himself well – he really 
            looks very impressive and nice to watch. Marat really had to work 
            for his win.<br>
            In post match interview he gave credit to opponent and with tongue 
            in cheek mentioned that with spectators it was even more difficult 
            (of course crown was 90% behind local boy but there was a few screams 
            during points). After this Marat asked if he can say something – he 
            wished a happy birthday to Casagrande, coach of Escude and good friend. 
            After this he asked if he can sing a birthday song and after getting 
            permission signed a “Happy birthday” song. Well, all I can say he 
            is better of as a tennis player not as a singer, but anyway it was 
            sweet and funny, crowd loved it.<br>
            After this went to 3rd court Moya/Kratochvil. Very good fight, K was 
            very impressive, Moya’s game was up and down but he managed to pull 
            trough after very tough long fight, at times playing fantastic tennis 
            and served well most of the time.<br>
            Next Nalbandian/Federer. N impressed me the most so far (may be Grosjean 
            as well against Mark). He is very solid from the base but unlike Chela 
            he is more all court player, but also very disciplined with his shots 
            and his second serve is solid as well. I left after he was serving 
            at 5:2 for the set. Btw I always find Federer lacking of something, 
            may be some real anger, I don’t know. Somehow still can’t see him 
            as a major force in GSs even thou his strokes is nice and fluid and 
            pleasure to watch.<br>
            Saw hard practicing Swedes – Norman, Enqvist, Bjorkman and Woodbridge 
            (not exactly a Swede). French guys also has been practicing together 
            very hard (Escude, Clement, Santoro).<br>
            Before going back (even still sunny, at 7PM it was getting cold) watched 
            a first set of doubles match Marat/Canas vs. Friedl/Stefanek.<br>
            I expected some kind of fun, relaxed play from Marat and Canas (who 
            finished his singles match not long ago) But looked like Marat took 
            it seriously, concentrating, has been serving great, a lot of good 
            1st serves, communicate with Canas well in Spanish. Hit a few fantastic 
            shots and Canas bowed to him in admiration half as a joke but half 
            seriously.<br>
            I’ve left after first set which Marat/Canas won 6:4.<br>
            I have so much more to write but it is really late and I have to rush 
            to the club.<br>
            Sorry for a messy report, will try to find more time to do it better 
            next time.<br>
            Best Regards<br>

            <b>04.18.2002</b><br>
            <br>
            Hi, everybody. Today I’m earlier as promised. Went for breakfast early 
            again 7AM and saw Spanish guys Martin, Corretja (sitting together) 
            and Moya by himself. I guess it was still early for the rest. Weather 
            was beautiful again, very bright sun, very light breeze. Since today 
            singles matches were on the two main courts only, decided to go to 
            the second court to get a good seat (first come basis) for Marat’s 
            match. I was quite happy he finally not playing on the central court 
            because the seats on the 2nd court very close to the court. Match 
            A.Martin/Costa. Surprisingly court wasn’t full. If fact I could watch 
            Moya/Corretja on the central court and still to get a good seat. I 
            decided to seat around service line, first row. Next to me was sitting 
            Costa’s coach. During whole match they have been communicating – some 
            sign language, some words, eye contact. It was very close game of 
            two Spanish claycourters but I was surprised to see how hard Martin 
            was hitting the ball and how aggressive he was with his shots. Costa 
            wasn’t far behind but his consistency was major reason he won this 
            very close match. Next Henman/Chela. During warm up Chela was hitting 
            well but Henman was hitting long from the base, missing volleys and 
            I thought it can be not so difficult for Chela – but I was wrong. 
            Henman started to play very well, but Chela was nervous, having problem 
            with range of his shots, he decided to take some pace off and Henman 
            used this opportunity to attack. I was a bit disappointed with Chela 
            – he wasn’t playing well, most of his shots were landing short, far 
            from the baseline and Henman was attacking and coming to the net. 
            You seldom can see so much volleying on clay even from a S&V player. 
            Chela woke up only once to win 4 straight games in the beginning of 
            the 2nd set. Nothing changed except he started to hit deep and Henman 
            was immediately in trouble. But for some reasons Chela started to 
            take pace of his shots again and Henman won following five games. 
            Chela was a bit lucky on the tie break and as he continue to play 
            like most of the time during first two sets Henman managed to win 
            a match even he has struggled a bit. I never really liked to watch 
            Henman play (but I always respected him for his on court behavior). 
            I don’t know, may be it is spring time – time of love. But like with 
            Roddick I’ve started kind of like Henman too. He appeared very happy 
            and relaxed on the court, looks like he is having fun. A lot of smiles, 
            laughs a few times at himself (once after he made “come on” and punching 
            the air a la Hewitt). Make some funny faces while admiring good passing 
            shots from Chela, once even told him “good shot” during changeover. 
            I also was quite surprised to hear from him loud F-word a few times 
            after missing serves. His game – he is definitely sharp at the net 
            and improved his forehand quite a lot so it is more interesting to 
            watch him. Finally Marat/Nalbandian. Court is packed, Amit and Rosset 
            are there. As I mention yesterday this guy is solid and he has blow 
            Federer out of court in previous round and it is not like Roger was 
            having off-day. So Marat took it seriously and started to play without 
            delay (unlike his two previous matches. Looking at the score 1st set 
            may look like one sided affair but don’t be mistaken. It was VERY 
            good tennis from both players but Marat was just a little bit better 
            on the big points. One moment he started stretching, touching his 
            back, called for medical trainer who applied medical cream and Marat 
            continued. Beginning of the second set Nalbandian got an early break 
            and Marat was quite angry with himself, he throw racquet on the court 
            and after checking that it is not broken he made sure that second 
            time he will get the job done, but didn’t get any warnings if I’m 
            not wrong. The whole second set he stepped out of gas a little bit. 
            No, he didn’t play bad, he played very good but so did Nalbandian. 
            It was along set with a lot of great points and hard fought games. 
            Marat faced difficulties while serving at 4:5 to stay in the set but 
            had two lucky points – one was a bad line call (ball touched the line 
            – it was just few meters away from the place I was sitting) but Marat 
            couldn’t tell which mark it was as he was far from that place and 
            chair umpire called it out. And next point – Marat’s serve clearly 
            touched the net and Nalbandian didn’t really bother to return but 
            umpire said there no indication from machine and gave point to Marat. 
            But this didn’t affect Nalbandian at all; he fought even harder and 
            managed to come 3 points from behind on the tiebreak to win second 
            set. I consider myself lucky to be there to see a wonderful tennis 
            from both players in the 3rd set but Marat! He really stepped up BIG 
            time. He started to hit unbelievable hard shots from the base (and 
            I thought another day Mark hitting ball hard – Marat was far ahead 
            today). It was great efforts from both players (as during whole match) 
            but Marat played tennis which (if he can sustain this level) can give 
            him not only MS on clay but GS as well. It was really fantastic. Nalbandian 
            didn’t drop his game, he played very well and fought hard until the 
            end but his efforts which I believe could be good enough to beat most 
            of the top 20 players simply wasn’t enough against Marat. I don’t 
            really like to keep tapes of tennis matches but this one I don’t mind 
            – best tennis I’ve seen on clay for a long time. Nalbandian has nothing 
            to be ashamed of – he played great and lost to really superb player, 
            I strongly believe nobody would ménage to win against Marat today. 
            His first serve was working, in fact, best I’ve seen this year. I 
            don’t know % but it definitely wasn’t bad, there were more flat serves 
            down the middle (incl. few aces which believe me is a great achievement 
            against Nalbandian on clay). His 2nd serve was very good, BH and FH 
            were there all the time, he varies shots with different amount of 
            topspin, he sliced well and volleys well too. However his drop shots 
            weren’t that good and during play at the net (level below the net 
            cord) his choice of shots (or execution) was pretty bad. It was a 
            very nice match in another aspect. Most of the time players were letting 
            decide each other if shot is in or out and only a few times umpire 
            had to come down. Both laughed when Nalbandian didn’t manage to put 
            return over the net on a drop shot and did it with extra touch. Also 
            once Marat got a lucky winner (ball hit the net cord and changed direction) 
            he not just raised his hand but made sure Nalbandian saw it. It was 
            really great pleasure and the best match I’ve seen so far here. We 
            talked about it with MF and thought Marat may be not going to play 
            doubles – his back and some more it was already almost 5:30 PM (btw 
            his match was close to 3 hours). But before leaving I saw that he 
            is going to play on the central court in a while. I thought it is 
            a bit too much for him but hopefully he knows what he is doing. I 
            decided not to watch doubles or Pavel/Johansson . I really felt that 
            I have no more left after just watching Marat plays (but he still 
            played doubles). His next opponent – Moya – had relatively easy game 
            which finished early (unlike yesterday when he had hard battle in 
            the late afternoon against Kratochvil). As I mentioned, he serving 
            well, moving well, his FH very good and clay is his favorite surface. 
            So – good luck to Marat tomorrow. Best Regards. <br>

            <br>
            Hi, everybody.<br>
            As usual had an early breakfast, saw Hewitt, Kim, Stoltenberg . Hewitt 
            was taking drinks and other food for Kim while she was at the table. 
            Nice to se guy with “hell may care” attitude on court to behave this 
            way in normal life, nice contrast.<br>
            Went to country club early, wanted to see Marat work out before the 
            match but can’t find him (but didn’t try very hard). Hewitt was practicing 
            with Norman, Stoltenberg also was there. Once again was impressed 
            by Norman’s preparation (early, knee bend) for the shots. But he hit 
            his FH from such a close stance that it will be hard for him to play 
            well on other surfaces besides clay with all young guys coming. On 
            another court Kim was practicing with her coach.<br>
            On the centre court double partners Ferrero and Robredo were hitting, 
            later Costa and Moya started their warm up (looked to me it is a bit 
            early for Costa). Nothing special, Moya had some problems with his 
            volleys and coach has been trying to fix it, but I thought it won’t 
            be a stroke he has to use against Marat often.<br>
            Fist QF Ferrero/Haas<br>
            Haas looked like he just got out of the bed. And I’m not talking about 
            his looks only (he was unshaved) - his played like he is still half 
            asleep. Ferrero was breaking him and giving him break on his own accord, 
            Haas looked like an extra while Ferrero was a lead actor. But Ferrero 
            himself didn’t play well. I dare to call it a boring match; I think 
            one of the worst in terms of quality of tennis and entertainment so 
            far I’ve seen here.<br>
            Next Safin/Moya.<br>
            Well if to talk about quality of tennis it was definitely better and 
            it was going up almost with every game. As for entertainment – I guess 
            it was on TV and third set was very very exiting.<br>
            In my previous posts from MC I have mentioned that Moya was serving 
            well and his FH (which is considered as one of the best on the tour) 
            was working. Well, it was the same in the QF. Hi first serve get him 
            out of trouble in a lot of critical moments (unlike Marat) and his 
            FH was a very effective during the whole match, he was running around 
            it a lot and it gave opportunity to Marat to open court more but he 
            failed to explore it.<br>
            Marat started slow again (like his first two matches), he was making 
            a lot of UE and his 1st serve wasn’t very effective, looked slower 
            than yesterday. He was not moving very well, not a very good footwork, 
            timing on the ball wasn’t right. He stepped it up a little bit in 
            the second set with better serving and more aggressive play which 
            immediately make cracks in Moya’s armor.<br>
            Third set wasn’t a very good tennis from both with a number of mistakes 
            but with a lot of spectacular points from both as well.<br>
            Marat was very comfortable at the net when he has to volley but once 
            he had to make extra effort to reach on passing shot (usually down 
            the line) he appeared to be not committed enough (I guess it has to 
            be his physical condition) and preferred to let it go time after time 
            hoping it will land outside the lines.<br>
            Another thing I’ve mention in my previous posts that Marat during 
            this tourney having problem at the net with balls below the net cord. 
            I’m sure Moya’s coach was watching Marat’s last match and that’s where 
            all drop shots from Moya came from. Its weren’t that great or unreachable 
            (may be one or two) but Marat as before failed to make use of it – 
            he either was putting the ball out or in place where Moya could comfortably 
            take it not on the run. BTW Marat being a bit slow didn’t help him 
            on those shots either. Moya hit a lot of drop shots in critical moments 
            of the match (in the third set especially and despite missing some, 
            like on the first match point) he still succeeded.<br>
            But what you can’t take away from Marat – his fighting spirit. Even 
            not playing his best tennis, he fought very, very hard, coming from 
            the set down and than in the 3rd when Moya was serving for the match 
            and then in the tie break. It was a lot of breakpoints for both, a 
            lot of deuce games. He didn’t crack under pressure in tight situation 
            and played some spectacular tennis on important points. Besides great 
            play from Moya, his 1st serve and what looked to me like tiredness 
            (after too much of late tennis in doubles) contributed to his defeat.<br>
            Next Grosjean/Costa.<br>
            Surprisingly number of people left after Marat’s match, it was slightly 
            less spectators (but still, may be 95% full).<br>
            In terms of quality of tennis IMO it was a best match on the central 
            court today. But it wasn’t nowhere near to previous match in terms 
            of entertainment. Person sitting next to me (who is not a tennis fan) 
            said something like: “it is very exiting to watch Safin play, winning 
            or loosing, but this match is boring”. Both players has been playing 
            well from the base, Costa was solid like in his previous matches, 
            but Grosjean was hitting winners from the base on BH and esp. on FH 
            with such an ease and with so much power that Costa was unable to 
            coupe with it. Add here great serving from Grosjean (I think he hit 
            more aces than I see in any match so far during this tournament) and 
            I little less than before consistency from Costa and You will see 
            why it was over so fast. As in previous match I’ve watched (against 
            Mark) Grosjean was again very impressive.<br>
            Watched first set of next match Safin/Canas vs. YK/Haahuis. Marat 
            once again took it seriously enough and seems he is very comfortable 
            playing with Canas (IMO communicating well in Spanish also helps). 
            But he looked a bit tired and his 1st serve wasn’t very good as well.<br>
            Have no chance to see last QF Henman/Johansson as it was on different 
            court.<br>
            If I have to name favorites is SFs it will be definitely Grosjean 
            and Moya. But of course anything can happen. I wouldn’t dismiss Ferrero 
            on clay and Henman has to beat 3 typical clay courters on the way 
            to SF. So hopefully it will be interesting matches.<br>
            During dinner saw double team Escude/Clement sitting at the next table 
            (they are in the SF); late Grosjean joined them for a while.<br>
            It is 20th morning now.<br>
            Just came back after breakfast, saw Tommy Haas with his coach having 
            breakfast. He still didn’t shave but doesn’t look less glamorous because 
            of it. Even being a man I have to say I understand why so many girls 
            find him very good looking. But he was very moody, no smiles as he 
            preparing to leave the hotel. Earlier Costa was checking out. If early 
            in the week you could see a lot of casually dressed guys with tennis 
            bags in the lobby, now mostly people in business suits – it is a last 
            day tomorrow.<br>
            Going to the club.<br>
            Regards<br>

            <b>04.21.2002</b><br>
            <br>
            Hi, everybody.<br>
            First of all, a few words about Marat’s QF match and overall impression 
            on his game during this tournament.<br>
            May be I’ve sounded too critical in my yesterday's comments on his 
            QF performance so want to clarify – it was very good tennis from him 
            esp. 2 and 3 sets. At the end there was a few points which determinated 
            the winner, a few very close shots from both which could go in or 
            out easily.<br>
            So Marat has nothing to be ashamed of, but I’m sure he isn’t happy 
            about outcome – he had his chances in the 3rd set but failed to take 
            it (Moya also contributed to it). Forgotten to mention that his return 
            wasn’t good in the 1st set but improved later and he even had a few 
            return winners.<br>
            Overall impression on Marat’s game during this week – he feels comfortable 
            on clay, sliding well, still hits the ball very early on the ground 
            strokes which gives him big advantage even it is not obvious from 
            the first site. His 1st serve is coming back but still not there, 
            but overall consistency (%) is improving, 2nd serve – very good (as 
            from beginning of the year). Still looks a bit more comfortable with 
            BH but I dare not say that his FH is weaker. Still have a bit of trouble 
            with putting ball consistently deep to opponent’s baseline but it 
            can be beginning of the clay court season and I saw it improving. 
            Volleys – very good (when he not tired and committed – unlike in QF). 
            His returns weren’t his strongest part of the game during this week 
            but it improved slightly in the last two matches. As I mentioned before, 
            worst problem he had during the whole week – dealing with net play 
            with weak shots with ball below the net cord. Bad choices and bad 
            misses – it was very noticeable (and Moya use it very well).<br>
            Great fighting spirit, ability to raise his game, not going down on 
            himself (even we saw some ball and racquet abuse it wasn’t more than 
            any other guys and didn’t affect his game). In recent comments before 
            DC Wilander mention great quality of Marat not to be afraid to play 
            big points. I didn’t think too much about it before but after this 
            comments I started to pay attention to it and must say that it is 
            absolutely correct. So overall very positive impression, his game 
            definitely going up and I think he has a pretty good chance in RG 
            (somehow I feel that it may be his goal for clay court season). Glad 
            to see he has Rosset on the board. This guy has a lot of experience 
            and I’m sure can help a lot, I haven’t seen any disastrous game patterns 
            (or absence of it like in AO final) which is very encouraging sing 
            as well.<br>
            BTW for those who interested – he playing with Head Prestige Classic 
            painted black, only visible customatisation – long stripes of lead 
            tape (about 12 cm) at 3&amp;9 o’clock.<br>
            Well, yesterday’s action.<br>
            Watch a bit of practice Bjorkman and Woodbridge – hitting a lot of 
            long rallies on volleys wit amazing speed. Saw the end of practice 
            Clement and Escude. They took a lot of photos with fans on the way 
            to lockers room, with a lot of politeness and smiles.<br>
            First it was doubles Bjorkman/Woodbridge vs. Escude/Clement – very 
            close match with a lot of good points, Woodbridge throwing racquet 
            far outside the court in frustration. Even French guys have lost it 
            seems they have a very good understanding, besides playing they spend 
            a lot of time together (and not only on the tennis court). They may 
            play in DC against US and will be a very dangerous.<br>
            Saw a bit of Grosjean practicing, didn’t look happy with his serve.<br>
            Next Ferrero /Grosjean.<br>
            Ferrero settled in the match faster and easily won a first set. There 
            are nothing flashy about his game but it has a lot of substance, very 
            solid without major weakness (of course he is no a S&amp;V player 
            but I wouldn’t consider it as a weakness). And he has a very good 
            beautiful forehand.<br>
            Grosjean started to play as he did in his previous matches from the 
            2nd set. He hit was serving consistently around 190-200 km/h on the 
            first serve, hit a number of aces (I’m sure he hit more aces than 
            any other player during this tournament). He has been hitting great 
            FH (and sometimes BH) winners from the base line, he can generate 
            such tremendous racquet speed, it is amazing. Ferrero couldn’t do 
            anything. The 2nd set was over in no time. Than came rain break and 
            once they started to play again Grosjean didn’t look comfortable – 
            he kept complaining since it was still raining, asking umpire after 
            every point if play going to be suspended. Ferrero kept his cool and 
            jumped into the early lead before play was suspended. I hade something 
            to attend to and had no chance to see the rest of action but seems 
            trend has continued and it was quite easy for Ferrero. As for another 
            SF – I think it is a great result for Henman on clay (some he had 
            to play against a few solid claycourters); I’m quite surprised and 
            impressed.<br>
            Hopefully today won’t be any rain delays but weather doesn’t look 
            good at this moment.<br>
            Best regards <br>
