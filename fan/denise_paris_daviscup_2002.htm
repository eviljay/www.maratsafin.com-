            Davis Cup Final 29.11 to 01.12.2002<br>
<br>
When the script for the Davis Cup 2002 was written at the beginning 
              of the year – who would have predicted the ending and such a dramatic 
              one too! Last year was a real barnstormer in that Australia were 
              beaten on grass at home by France in the last match – no ways that 
              could be repeated! Says who? Davis Cup has always provided lots 
              of thrills and excitement and this year was no exception – the semis 
              provided lots of excitement – France at home on the clay of Roland 
              Garros beating the USA and Russia at home in Moscow beating Argentinia 
              – the three hour final set tiebreak in the doubles being a world 
              beater! <br><br>

              So here we were in Paris for the final between France the holders 
              and Russia the pretenders to the throne – third time in a Final 
              and Yevgeny Kafelnikov had said “ if we win the Davis Cup I will 
              retire – that will be the top”. France opted for the “red stuff” 
              - they had won on it in the semi but one drawback – indoors takes 
              away the weather factor on clay and the Russian players liked clay! 
              But the French had team spirit – the Russians didn’t even socialise! 
              So the arguments went back &amp; forth – on paper the Russians were 
              the team with their top players Marat Safin and Yevgeny Kafelnikov 
              but the French had home ground and their supporters and their magic! 
              <br><br>

              The stage was set for a thrilling encounter and I was lucky enough 
              to be there!<br><br>

              Decided that I needed to be with the Russian supporters – after 
              all I was going there to support Russia. I have been a Marat fan 
              for many years and this was his country and very important to him. 
              So I did not want to sit dotted amongst the French crowd. Through 
              the kind favour of a fellow Russian fan I managed to get a seat 
              via the Russian Federation. Cost a lot but it was worth it.<br><br>

              So Thursday after work packed up fast and on the plane back to the 
              Sofitel! Felt so familiar been there before – even the waiter at 
              the bar remembered me – as I asked for a drink he smiled and said 
              what I wanted – now I wonder which way to take that??<br><br>

              So all was set to go and watch the tennis! Lots of Russian being 
              spoken in the hotel lobby and Russians everywhere – was I really 
              in Paris or had I somehow ended up in Moscow?<br><br>

              When I first got downstairs and ordered my drink – sat down and 
              who is sitting at the table opposite looking very bored as she tries 
              to read – Katya in mini skirt – ultra short and boots – nearly put 
              me off my drink and food!! So what happened that night – Mama &amp; 
              Papa Safin came downstairs and had dinner behind me – later in walked 
              Dinara and joined them and then Denis Golovanov came in mobile in 
              hand – maybe he learned how from Marat!! Guy Forget and Santoro 
              were at another table – quite a cosmopolitan crowd! Later Marat 
              came down followed by Denis and as he walked past back to his room 
              – turned, looked at me and said with a smile “Hallo!” <br><br>

              Next day tennis due to start at 13.00. Had arranged with Maxim that 
              he would give my ticket to Christiane who would meet me at the hotel 
              at 11am. In between I ended up with an “unofficial” job – carrying 
              a couple of banners in to the stadium!! Supposedly because I wouldn’t 
              have any problems with the security – especially as the plastic 
              sleeve had all Israeli airline stickers on it!! What I do in the 
              name of Marat!! Well got in no problem just before 13.00 hours and 
              found my seat. In the queue to go through the security check got 
              asked about the posters – one word Safin?? Wee!! The fact that I 
              had on a red top made sure everyone knew which team I was supporting! 
              Inside met up with Maxim and Christiane- seats in the same area 
              as at Masters just higher up in Row 13 – actually had a great view. 
              Maxim presented me with a white cap with Russia on it which I wore 
              for the next 3 days! Russian flags to wave – red, white &amp; blue 
              noisemakers – Maxim had a large Russian flag and of course this 
              huge banner with Marat and his Masters trophy and the words “I love 
              Paris”. Also had one with YK and I love Paris for his match.<br>
              Well the tennis was spectacular – Marat was calm and focused – he 
              knew what he had to do and he stuck to his plan – apart from a slight 
              hiccup in the 3rd then back on course. We shouted Marat Marat or 
              Rassiya – we sang we clapped – we blew hard on the blowers – 1500 
              fans against 13500 French – we had to make ourselves heard and encourage 
              Marat – the noise when he won was deafening! Unfortunately YK’s 
              match was rather tame in comparison but was good that at least it 
              was 1-1 and the doubles to come. And that night Marat went out to 
              dinner with mom &amp; sister – it was lovely to see!<br><br>

              Well the doubles was heartache – felt so flat afterwards – Russia 
              needed that advantage now Marat had it all to do again. I was down 
              but it was amazing how upbeat Marat was when he arrived back at 
              the hotel! Stopped to chat with some friends at the table next door 
              – I got up to hand over something from a fan and said Bad Luck – 
              I’ve been shouting so hard I’ve nearly lost my voice! Marat says 
              “I’ve been losing my years!!” His way of saying this tie is giving 
              me grey hairs I guess.<br><br>

              The banners had been causing a lot of interest - for the doubles 
              had one of YK &amp; Marat together and Good Luck Russia – everyone 
              wanted a photo with that in the background! In the front row of 
              the Russian seats sat Mama and Papa and occasionally Dinara but 
              then she also sat with the team. Gerrard sat with them. Also Ayesha 
              YK’s daughter who is really lovely – I spent some of Sunday playing 
              balloon games with her as waited to come back down to my seat. Other 
              faces I recognised were all in the first 4 rows. Amit was doing 
              a great job of clapping, blowing hard and bouncing up and down – 
              then turning round and urging us all on to shout and blow like mad! 
              We did – shouted ourselves hoarse. <br><br>

              The atmosphere was electric on Sunday – the French all excited expecting 
              Grosjean to win and the Davis Cup would stay with France and of 
              course the Russian supporters hoping Marat would stay focused and 
              get them to 2-2. Then of course the news before we left for the 
              stadium – YK was not playing Mikhail Youzhny would play instead 
              – what would the French do? Lots of discussion and a bit of despair 
              from some fans who felt that the only chance was for YK to play! 
              Well you all know the game Marat played – he was brilliant – the 
              shots he played – out of this world. He left us breathless and hammered 
              Grosjean into the ground – the French had no answer. I think that 
              the following from an article in the International Herald Tribune 
              says it all<br><br>

              “Above all, Safin did a fine job, overwhelming the in-form Grosjean 
              in every compartment of the game in the first two sets : treating 
              the Frenchman’s second serve as if it were an underhand toss.<br><br>

              It was a bit like watching a determined wasp trying to get the best 
              of a bear. It’s interesting to watch. It might bother the bear for 
              a while. But you have a pretty fair idea of the outcome.”<br><br>

              The third set was tighter and you could see that Marat was fighting 
              fatigue after all he had played a lot of tennis again and of all 
              the players on Sunday he was the only one who had played all three 
              days. But with the shouts from the Russian supporters and the encouragement 
              of the Russian team – he hung in there and saved 4 set points in 
              the tiebreak and won – the relief was palpable – 2-2 now it was 
              up to Mischa.<br><br>

              Well to start with the stadium was pretty empty and so not a lot 
              of support and when he went down by 2 sets – some supporters started 
              leaving. The Russian down bit – Maxim was not feeling well but he 
              also said Marat did it for nothing and I said – stop this think 
              positive – and believe he can do it – we have to shout. So I started 
              waving the flag and shouting and got the young cheer leaders going 
              and so we tried to get Mischa going. At first as they said only 
              Stolbin and Andrei were really encouraging but then Marat came in 
              from his match and at first he seemed a bit down and then when we 
              started shouting he decided – we have to fight – so Marat the coach 
              the encourager the blower of noise started. Clapping talking ever 
              there – talking to Tarphischev – obviously giving the benefit of 
              his experience playing Mathieu and Mischa started fighting. Every 
              time he got a point – the fans chanted his name and waved the flag 
              and he started feeding off them – by pumping his arm and waving 
              on the fans. The support became more frenzied and the bench were 
              jumping up and down – on their feet for every point – applauding 
              and clapping and encouraging. And Mischa found that extra gear and 
              played his game and despite being broken he broke back and then 
              he got that mystical break in the 7th game and then held his serve 
              to love to lead 5.3. Then he almost broke Mathieu to take the match 
              but Paul-Henri hung on – the shame of losing would be bad enough 
              but at least he would try to keep on fighting to the end. Then that 
              last service game – each point had us on tenterhooks and finally 
              the serve and the return forehand into the net – the Russian bench 
              erupted onto the court and the Russian supporters were screaming 
              – some were crying – Russia had done it – they had won the Davis 
              Cup! That beautiful Silver bowl standing on its huge pedestal with 
              102 years history surrounding it was now the proud possession of 
              Russia for a year – the dream had been fulfilled! <br><br>

              And of course those pictures of Boris Yeltsin clambering over the 
              edge of the VIP box despite his wife’s anxious pleas – he had sat 
              there through thick and thin for eight hours and been through joy 
              as Marat won and levelled the tie and the despair as Mischa went 
              2 sets down and then the joy when that final shot into the net meant 
              the cup was Russia’s – a truly great supporter of Russian Tennis!<br><br>

              One picture that I thought was beautiful in the French L’Equipe 
              – Marat patting Mathieu on the head and Santoro patting Marat on 
              the shoulder and Yevgeny giving Guy Forget a big hug. That was the 
              main thing – the whole match over the three days was played in the 
              most wonderful fair play atmosphere – each side’s player accepting 
              serves that were called out – clapping good shots – apart from a 
              couple of queries – no histrionics – no tantrums – all in all three 
              days of magnificent tennis!<br><br>

              The music played and we all danced in the stands and the players 
              and officials were dancing on the clay and then “We are the Champions” 
              played and down from the roof came thousands of gold and silver 
              discs sparkling in the light and showering all below. Felt sad when 
              I walked out to leave. Like had left the magic behind in that beautiful 
              stadium. Walked back with my cap still on my head and the Russian 
              flag draped round my shoulders through the fairly empty streets 
              – it was after all about 10.30pm and I had been watching tennis 
              since 1pm!!<br><br>

              When reached the hotel a party was in full swing – the Russians 
              were celebrating – several had watched it all on the TV in the hotel 
              lobby as they couldn’t get tickets. Vee and Matt and Isabelle were 
              there and rushed over to give me a hug. I had not eaten since breakfast 
              – was high on an adrenalin rush and promptly downed two vodkas – 
              I wanted to party!!<br><br>

              As each official and player arrived they were greeted with loud 
              cheers. All the French team and players were clapped in as they 
              arrived. Rausa arrived beaming from ear to ear – she and I had talked 
              a bit during the banner hanging – yes I was working again!! And 
              so I went up and said it was wonderful, fantastic and she said Yes 
              it was! Got everyone to sign my cap – when Marat came in said I 
              have worn this cap for three days and now everyone must sign it 
              – it will never be worn again – gave him a big kiss and said congratulations 
              – what a fantastic victory – signed and gave me such a big smile!<br><br>

              So as they all came down dressed up – Anatoli smiling and looking 
              so cute – Marat looking absolutely gorgeous in white shirt and black 
              jacket and longs as only he can – Mischa smiling bemusedly at everyone 
              – think it was still sinking in as to what he had done – Mama grinning 
              from ear to ear – Tarphischev looked so pleased – never one for 
              much expression – suddenly he couldn’t stop smiling – Dinara looking 
              lovely in a long black quilted coat – she is so tall and is really 
              attractive – all those memories of a truly magnificent victory. 
              Well it is something I will treasure in my mind for years to come 
              – my first Davis Cup tie and Final and if I never see another one 
              again – I don’t care - to paraphrase a certain young man!<br>
