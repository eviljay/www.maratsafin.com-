            Sunday 22 July 2001</b><br>
            <br>
            Hi everyone <br>
            Well not much happening at the moment - sitting in the hotel typing 
            this so can put it on disc and hopefully go down to an internet cafe 
            and send to you.<br>
            Arrived late Thursday - and Friday walked to the courts. Small and 
            compact area not unlike Dubai so it is great for getting around and 
            being close to the players. Saw Pete Sampras practicing with Cecil 
            Mamit and Greg Rusedski and Magnus Norman and Max Myrnyi amongst others. 
            No Marat around. Was supposed to get in to the Draw party on Friday 
            night but couldn't - was very last minute on a ticket that hadn't 
            been used but anyhow couldn't be helped. As it turned out - jet lag 
            caught up with me and I collapsed very early.<br>
            Saturday went down to the court to try and find out the draw - on 
            the way found an internet cafe and checked the sites - no draw. So 
            walked in and said &quot;hi have you got the draw not on the site 
            yet - this was at 11.15am - it is early says the girl - think they 
            all had a bit of a hungover state from the party the night before. 
            Anyhow she had a copy and there it was Marat against Andy Roddick 
            - the one we all talked about - rather a tough draw for Marat but 
            he talks about tough matches to get his confidence back and this is 
            one.<br>
            Well settled down to watch Max Myrnyi with a hard workout - he is 
            looking really good and has obviously spent the time since Wimbledon 
            toning up. Spoke to him and said &quot;playing well is this better 
            than grass?&quot; Said yes much better Wimbledon was so heavy - the 
            ball moves better here. Actually Wimbledon has come up a couple of 
            times - Pete Sampras made a remark on Friday when Cecil Mamit hit 
            a ball back and they both agreed it was out and Pete said now in Wimbledon 
            that would have been in - there was bad line calls there!!<br>
            So back to watching Max practice and waiting and then suddenly walking 
            towards me sitting at the table was that orange T shirt again - Marat 
            had arrived - on his own no entourage - I looked at him and said at 
            last you are here I was getting worried you weren't coming here after 
            all and he smiled! Didn't have the camera out so no photos. He charged 
            off - always moves fast in between signing and photos galore and disappeared 
            round the corner. I was in two minds whether to follow him but ended 
            up talking to 2 UCLA guys who are doing a write up on the tournament 
            - had to keep telling them who the different players were and then 
            ended up being asked a few questions - who did I support and why did 
            I think Marat was such a great player. Good fun! <br>
            And then Marat came back and walked on the court and was practicing 
            with Xavier Malisse who Stefanki with him - I thought Malisse was 
            with Felgate and Stefanki is helping Tim Henman through the hard court 
            season - all very confusing. Well started slowly - lost a lot of the 
            tan he had in Wimbledon and it was fairly hot - 27C and he started 
            off on the sunny side and then went to the other end where he could 
            stand in the shade. I was right behind the seats - simple court with 
            wire netting around it and tables and chairs for us to sit on. Looked 
            a bit tired and I found out why later. He had only flown in on the 
            Friday and hadn't gone to the draw party - said when to one of the 
            bars or whatever and then to bed.<br>
            Well had a good practice and then came out and I asked one guy to 
            take the photo of me and Marat and he did - we were trying to talk 
            at the same time so expressions were not good but at least looking 
            straight at the camera and smiling. He is so tall next to short me!<br>
            Later saw him walking back after a shower and headed off to the transport 
            back.<br>
            Great seeing him - I am a lot calmer now than I was in Dubai but wait 
            until he plays! Just spoken to Susan and we think he might play the 
            night match tomorrow after the exhibition with Pete and Andre as it 
            will be a big draw card Andy against Marat so will have a lot of people 
            there. Anyhow we will tie up later and then arrange to meet there. 
            Another one for the forum.<br>
            All for now must finish and start off to the courts. Will keep reporting 
            to you all and try for some more photos.<br>
            Cheers all <br>

            <b>Monday 23 July 2001 Part 1 </b><br>
            <br>
            Hi everyone!<br>
            Well a nice day yesterday - great weather lots of sun and a happy 
            and relaxed Marat. First of all after a lot of arrangements I set 
            off for the courts about 11.30. I walk each day approx a 20 minute 
            walk but on this day I rode in luxury via a courtesy car which had 
            just dropped off a player at the hotel!! Great start to the day. Anyhow 
            went in - Pete playing Magnus in practice on centre court and so stood 
            at the top of the stands and looked down and as I looked who came 
            out of the players locker room and walked towards the practice court 
            at the back but Marat - learning to recognize that walk and figure 
            from afar with ease!!<br>
            Anyhow raced down and sat down behind under a shady umbrella this 
            time and there was Marat about to practice with Taylor Dent. Well 
            the first words were &quot;be gentle with me hey I haven't played 
            for a week!!&quot; Basically I suppose trying to get himself used 
            to a big serve on hardcourt - well there was discussion about what's 
            your fastest serve - Marat getting beaten and getting cross with himself 
            - lots of Aiee!! (sorry a sound that doesn't convert to words very 
            well) blowing and a couple of racquet bounces. Further discussion 
            about racquets very interesting - basically for all those who had 
            the long debate about the racquet - &quot;used the same racquet since 
            he was 14 - difficult to adjust to a new one&quot; etc etc. Anyhow 
            they were there for about ? hour and then Sandon Stolle arrived to 
            practice - Marat says hey come on man I need to practice - why says 
            Sandon you can't play tennis!! Well a ball somehow ended up at Sandon 
            so a lot of good clean fun!!<br>
            Anyhow the practice finished and I talked to Sheena who I had met 
            up with about my tickets and then she went and I thought I am sure 
            Marat will come back to practice on centre court - he needs the practice 
            and especially with the match against Andy Roddick coming up. I had 
            asked Marat at the first practice did he know when he would be playing 
            - he said he hoped only Tuesday - Taylor felt he would only play on 
            Wednesday as Carlos Moya was only due to arrive late last night. But 
            the thing was they didn't know. Well as we know now he isn't playing 
            today so has another day of practice. By now Marat knows that when 
            I ask these questions,&quot;I need to know for your unofficial website 
            maratsafin.com as you don't have an official one.&quot; Come on Marat 
            need to take a picture - I did but still not got the hang of this 
            new digital camera and forgot I still had too much zoom so it was 
            blurred - he did stop for me too and smiled - being very good at that!!<br>
            So sitting around at the very top of the main stadium around 3pm -in 
            the shade had a couple of bananas to keep up the strength and look 
            down and who has walked on to court to practice but Marat and Michel 
            Llodra - well made a beeline down to the very edge of the court and 
            sat myself down to enjoy! Lots of banter especially the be kind bit 
            again and then apologizing to Llodra when hit hard at him - the strokes 
            were coming he was practicing the down the line shot and then they 
            played a couple of games. Marat was brutal - I think the first game 
            they played was 6.1 and the second don't know - Llodra had no answer 
            to him. The strokes were flowing, lots of laughter and jokes but the 
            serious side was there - this was Marat without a coach but really 
            dedicated to making sure he plays well. As he has said the serve is 
            not yet up to the % of the US Open last year but it is getting better 
            and he varies it so much. In the midst of this friend Amit arrives, 
            think he had just got off the plane and great greetings on court and 
            lots of &quot;was good shot no?&quot; and &quot;I am great tennis 
            player&quot; &quot;Can I play tennis?&quot; He was playing to the 
            crowd as well which was terrific because it is a long time since I 
            have seen Marat use the crowd - at one point he hit a great shot that 
            closed out the game and we all clapped and he lifted his arms in his 
            usual way to acknowledge - Marat is happier and more relaxed and he 
            is on hardcourts - his surface!<br>
            It is going to be a hard match but I feel confident he has it in him 
            to do it!<br>
            I hope you enjoy the pics just a few of all the ones I took. Getting 
            snap happy as they say!!<br>
            Cheers<br>

            <b> Monday 23 July 2001 Part 2</b> <br>
            <br>
            Well hi everyone!<br>
            So today Monday was the first official day of the tournament. Left 
            the hotel at 10.00am but unfortunately couldn't post the report as 
            nowhere was open yet. Games were rather boring today - nothing much 
            that I wanted to see but went in and checked out my seat. I am in 
            the second row in the centre of the north stand directly behind the 
            players on the baseline. Great view.<br>
            So after watching the first set of Bob Bryan against Dupuis decided 
            it was too hot and I was not very interested in the game so wandered 
            off to the practice court. Agassi was on and of course huge crowds 
            - couldn't get near to see so I sat down in the shade at one of the 
            tables and waited. Sure enough just before 12noon Marat came hurrying 
            in - late again!! So he practiced with Xavier Malisse again and also 
            on court was Wayne Black of Zimbabwe with his coach. Had to double 
            up as only one court to practice on. Today Marat was not getting it 
            right - got very cross with himself - slammed the racquet against 
            the back wall - and shouted a lot and kept looking at the racquet 
            as if didn't understand it! Still not happy with the racquet - kept 
            asking other players about their tension - type of racquets etc. All 
            in all it was not a good practice. Had to laugh - Malisse and Black 
            were taking it in turns to serve to Marat at the other end and he 
            had to return and Wayne Black kept serving kick serves and Marat kept 
            netting the returns - got so cross said don't give me kick serves 
            - just shows how uptight he was.Especially as he is a good one at 
            giving kick serves as second serves or maybe it reminded him of his 
            old friend Santoro - Wayne is also short and doesn't give up!! So 
            I was not impressed after seeing that lot.<br>
            Then after having something to eat watched a young American Qualifier 
            Robbie Ginepri take out Lareau in 3 sets - interesting young player 
            has a good serve and good baseline play - one to watch. Except next 
            he will probably play Guga who we haven't seen yet or Moya. Presume 
            they will be out to practice tomorrow and play on Wednesday.<br>
            Well after the game thought I am sure Marat has to come back to practice 
            again after that ghastly practice earlier so went to the practice 
            court and there was Max Mirnyi and the next thing there was Marat 
            - so he is dedicated enough to know he has to come back and get things 
            right. The general play was a lot better but keeps hitting his slice 
            volley into the net - somehow is turning his hand down too much so 
            that was getting him cross and lost his first two service games because 
            of bad returns. Also that racquet gets looked at a lot - lots of glares 
            and mutters. Better get it right. He was looking at Schalken's racquet 
            as he uses a Dunlop and asking him some questions. Think it is a question 
            of balance and getting the stringing done correctly for him. But mostly 
            a better practice session - still a lot of work to do. Running for 
            one point he overran the court and almost into the table at the side 
            of the court that holds the water. Had to pull up suddenly and winced 
            slightly and felt his lower leg - not sure if it was the knee or the 
            calf muscle. Anyhow continued for a while but then said to Max &quot; 
            that's enough I don't want to continue&quot;. Winced a little bit 
            when he walked so I was a teensy weensy bit worried. Well off he went 
            to the showers and I presumed the physio as he was there for about 
            1 and a ? hours. Didn't want to leave until I was sure he was okay. 
            So then he came back and I took another photo - said sorry only me 
            taking another photo - I messed the first one up! Got a smile and 
            then I said &quot;Are you okay nothing wrong and Marat said no I am 
            fine so I said okay bye see you tomorrow&quot; Think he is getting 
            used to this mad bat who keeps taking photos and sitting watching 
            him practice. Also he was smiling so if anything was seriously wrong 
            would have looked down.<br>
            Got a long day tomorrow- Marat is only playing at 9pm - Roddick practiced 
            after Marat at 1pm and looked good and then played doubles with JM 
            Gambill which they won easily so Marat please please get it together 
            and play well!!<br>
            Will email these reports for the two days and the photos tomorrow 
            morning. The one after the match will only be able to do on Wednesday.<br>
            Go Marat we believe in you!<br>

            <b>Tuesday 24 July 2001</b> <br>
            <br>
            He Won!! He Won!! He Won!!<br>
            Oh the joy, the heartache, the tears, the pain!!<br>
            There I was standing in the front row of the seats on the baseline 
            in line with the centre line tonight clapping like mad with tears 
            in my eyes - our man is back and wow is he back!!<br>
            How to explain that exquisite joy as he took the match point and the 
            once young pretender now proved as the mature Grand Slam winner, took 
            out the new young pretender who had no answer to the brilliance of 
            Marat Safin!<br>
            Not that Andy Roddick played badly - Marat just played him brilliantly. 
            He played each point thinking - slowed down the returns - thought 
            out how he was going to play this young upstart who dared to be favoured 
            as going to take him out. The review on the draw sheet was Andy Roddick 
            to take him out in three sets - how wrong they were!! I always knew 
            he could do it and he did.<br>
            He came on in his grey and black and looked the part. One precaution 
            had his lower knee strapped against the slight pull on Sunday. There 
            were no histrionics - Roddick did those - there were a few eyebrows 
            raised and a couple of mutters but he kept his cool even when his 
            first serve deserted him in the second set but when it mattered out 
            came those brilliant passing shots and the good serves. The second 
            serve was brutal - so much spin - it left Roddick floundering. Apart 
            from a couple of times when he inadvertently played onto the Roddick 
            forehand, he played it slowly and methodically onto the Roddick backhand 
            and waited for him to make the mistakes. But there were also the passing 
            shots down the line, the brilliant pick up off his toes, the passing 
            shot on the run to name but a few. A couple of times young Andy stood 
            and applauded the winning shot - there was nothing he could do! Tonight 
            he had a lesson in how at 21 Marat has matured and he can teach the 
            youngster how to play!<br>
            Marat was running down every point - at one point he even ran past 
            the net trying to save a point then came back, toweled down and said 
            &quot; Hey I am old for this!!&quot; Everyone laughed like mad!! It 
            was fairly humid and the players were sweating profusely! Andy Roddick 
            just couldn't get his ground strokes going and turned to the crowd 
            and said &quot;anyone got any ground strokes for sale?&quot; <br>
            So it was a wonderful end to a great day. Watched Marat practice with 
            Pete Sampras at 13.00 - Pete so stern - never smiled and Marat who 
            loves to joke - hit a couple of balls straight at Pete and did a couple 
            of passing shots on him and got no response so said &quot;sorry&quot; 
            - still the young man who so respects Pete! The Marat who is so good 
            to his fans - today was kids day and when he left the court and went 
            through the tunnel to the locker rooms - I managed to go round the 
            other court and beat him to it - he came out still signing and having 
            photos taken - ever the smiling patient Marat - the man for his fans. 
            Saw Guga come out and practice at last and Carlos Moya - both still 
            struggling to come to terms with the transition from clay to hardcourt 
            and they play their first matches tomorrow which should be interesting.<br>
            Marat practicing at 7.00pm with Cecil Mamit who was slightly overawed 
            at being practice partner with the great Marat Safin - Marat shook 
            hands with him at the end to say thank you for the time! The woman 
            sitting near me who stays in their hotel and says what a gentleman 
            - if you are in the lift with him or going to get into the lift - 
            he stands aside to let you through - unlike some of the others who 
            are so rude. &quot;If I was only 20 years younger&quot; said she!! 
            Then Marat talking to Carlos Moya in Spanish - he changes so - his 
            hands go and he is so different!<br>
            Meeting with Susan and at the end the joy that Marat had done it! 
            Susan so pleased as the last time she saw Marat live was at Indian 
            Wells and he was injured so now she has seen the whole Marat - the 
            player - the hardcourt specialist back in his element. The lovely 
            thing was at the end Amit walking on court to give Marat a hug because 
            deep down Marat was scared because he had a hard first round match 
            and his hardcourt season had to get on track to climax with the US 
            Open!!<br>
            Yes Marat you are on track - next stop Malisse and then on from there. 
            It is back on track to the US Open and the maturity in the way you 
            handled this match was a joy to behold! Thank you for making it such 
            a wonderful joyful day!!<br>
            And now we await Thursday and his next match. Roll on I can't wait!<br>

            Thursday 26 July 2001</b><br>
            <br>
            The day was hot and Marat was on early. He practiced first against 
            James Blake - a young American qualifier. Looked fine except for a 
            yellow T-shirt that looked as though it had come out of the hotel 
            laundry and shrunk a bit. That is quite possible - the reason I avoid 
            the hotel laundry service but I guess the tennis players have no option.<br>
            Marat came on court dressed all in white - probably much better considering 
            the heat or maybe he did tear his other shirt on Tuesday night - who 
            knows!!<br>
            The match against Malisse started fine - each was playing well - Marat 
            was not getting as many first serves in as on Tuesday night but no 
            worry at this stage. Yes he was a bit frustrated in that he would 
            build up a point and then the final one would go astray by mere millimeters. 
            Malisse was getting in some great passing shots and was holding his 
            serve easier though Marat had two chances to break Malisse in the 
            first set. All in all it was a set that looked set for the tiebreaker 
            or lottery as Marat always calls it. It definitely looked as though 
            that first set could go to either player and I felt that Marat had 
            a pretty good chance of taking it. There were some brilliant points 
            - retrieving shots from either side of the court - one where Marat 
            did a brilliant cross court shot along the net taking Malisse right 
            out of court - a fantastic retrieve as you felt that Marat had made 
            the winning shot but back it came and Marat had to finish it off by 
            just popping it over the net. Malisse had slipped so Marat came over 
            to check he was okay. Ever the solicitous person - polite at all times.<br>
            Malisse won the first set on two points where superb passing shots 
            by Marat were judged out. There were some inconsistent line calls 
            so it was a bit frustrating. Despite all this Marat kept his cool 
            - there were moments of trying to smash the racquet but held himself 
            back. How I don't know - in normal circumstances he probably would 
            have smashed his racquet - he didn't even sky a ball a fact which 
            was amazing. But you could feel this uncertainty in that he couldn't 
            understand why the shots were going astray. He was doing everything 
            right but it wasn't happening. So the first set ended 7.5 to Malisse. 
            Up until then Malisse was still quite uncertain and you felt it could 
            go either way. But winning that first set gave him confidence and 
            he came out renewed - and broke Marat in the first game. There were 
            just two points in it again and Marat could not break back despite 
            having a couple of break points. And so the second set went 6.3 and 
            that was it.<br>
            Susan and I met up and decided we needed a drink each to drown our 
            sorrows and then sitting at the practice courts - our favourite position 
            as all the players had to come past to go to the transportation desk 
            and the kids could get autographs - I had my back to the entrance 
            from the courts and Susan said here comes Marat. Well he had on the 
            greatest shorts black and white like an army camouflage type pattern 
            and a navy T Shirt. Looked very sexy. Seemed relaxed and smiling and 
            signing for all who asked. I turned and said Bad Luck and he looked 
            straight at me &amp; acknowledged and Susan said as he walked on Good 
            Luck for the summer and he smiled and said Thank You. Still ever the 
            polite smiling person we know.<br>
            Susan &amp; I discussed the match and as we both said, &quot;it wasn't 
            that Marat played badly, it is just that Malisse played exceptionally 
            well - it was his day and not Marat's.<br>
            Then on Friday 27th I watched Malisse' match against Taylor Dent and 
            as it finished I saw Amit come into the stadium and thought Marat 
            is here. Went straight off to the practice court and there I watched 
            Marat practice with Andy Roddick for almost two hours. Firstly I was 
            impressed that if Marat was not interested as some people tend to 
            think and not committed to his tennis - what was he doing out here 
            in the heat of the day at 2pm working really hard. Andy was hitting 
            the ball hard at him and they were both running around the court. 
            Marat was practicing all those combinations that just hadn't worked 
            the day before and they still were not working - going too long or 
            wide. He would do it again and try and adjust the strength of how 
            he was hitting the shot and it would still not go right. He then shouted 
            &quot; It's not me it's my racquet!&quot; He was very frustrated until 
            finally it all boiled over and 1,2,3 and the racquet was well &amp; 
            truly smashed. Went and changed for a new one and said sorry to Andy. 
            Still being polite!! Then they practiced some more and the next thing 
            he walked to the corner and you heard all the racquets going - this 
            was not indiscipline as some people think - it was just total frustration 
            at the lack of something with the racquet. I had watched him all week 
            talking to various people about the racquet - talking to those who 
            also use Dunlop asking their advice and so on. It is a real problem 
            and something he needs to solve but is not finding the immediate solution. 
            Andy spoke to his coach and said, &quot;I might have to loan him one 
            of my racquets&quot;. Anyhow what was so nice is Andy's coach went 
            down and started talking to Marat and obviously made some suggestions 
            and so they continued on and on with ground stroke combinations - 
            1 &amp; 1 - side to side - they went on and on. At one point Andy 
            was asked by someone how long he was going to be and he said this 
            could be a 4 hour practice. The great thing was Marat was committed 
            to practicing and getting it right - Andy was giving him a good work 
            out and also benefiting from Marat's hard hitting - he was learning 
            too. Several times when Marat left him stranded, Andy would acknowledge 
            the shot. Always at the break Andy would get a bottle of Energy juice 
            each and go to the back of the court and there was laughter and camaraderie 
            and it was great to see between two young players. They are the future 
            of the game and they will meet many a time again but at that stage 
            they were helping each other out.<br>
            And after the two hours Marat came out - didn't go and shower - bare 
            chested - signing and lots of girls having their photos taken with 
            him. It was very good PR - he showed his commitment to the game and 
            he also gave that extra to the fans who were missing out as he was 
            no longer in the tournament.<br>
            I seriously feel that Marat wants his hard court season to go well. 
            He is now in Montreal to defend his title. Mats will be there with 
            him and they will work together to perfect his game and sort out the 
            racquet problem. Believe me Marat is back and determined to prove 
            to all that it was not a flash in the pan last year- he can do it 
            again. He can rise above the pain of injury and the frustrations of 
            what it has done to his year and as he matures - show us just what 
            a wonderful tennis player he is. I wish I could be there when he defends 
            his title at the US Open - believe me he will go all out to do it.<br>
            Marat IS back and he will very soon show us how much.<br>
            See you in Paris Bercy, Marat - my next stop!! <br>
            Cheers<br>
