            I wanted to get back on Marat's match that I attended yesterday with 
            Denise and Ilaria among other fans.<br>
            What was that ???<br>
            First of all it happened on court n°1.<br>
            Why???<br>
            Marat is the one who won the title last year he deserved to play on 
            center court.<br>
            But…<br>
            But Guga, Grosjean, and Arazi played the same day…<br>
            <br>
            Kuerten with his 3 titles in RG is considered as a major player by 
            the organizers who think that he has many fans in France. But I'm 
            sure Marat is more popular among the French public. I know a lot of 
            fans of his and above all I remember how the crowd was devoted to 
            him last year during his final against Philippoussis.<br>
            <br>
            Of course Grosjean is French and he will certainly go to Sydney so 
            perhaps he's got an excuse. And eventually if Arazi was broadcast 
            on center court it is certainly because he speaks French and has a 
            French coach (Thierry Champion). So I guess they preferred nationalistic 
            considerations to fairness as far as the results are concerned….silly….<br>
            <br>
            Let's go back to court n°1. The good point is that as there are no 
            booked seats there, so we succeeded in being in the first row. But 
            what a cold atmosphere there !! The court is installed on a skating 
            rink that has been transformed just for the tournament. So it's cold 
            and dark, but hopefully the fans were here to make the fever rise. 
            (and perhaps too much sometimes: once I thought that the girls behind 
            me were going to hit the supporters of Vinciguerra.)<br>
            <br>
            I was really excited about seeing Marat so close, and also Mats who 
            seemed to me very worried. But the match was a torture for all Marat's 
            fan. And also for the umpires… Before the match starts I heard two 
            of them chatting and laughing: &quot;Oh no !! not Safin, He's going 
            to shoot us as usual (addressing to the public): does anyone want 
            to take my seat?&quot;. It's true that Marat's serves are really impressive 
            ! I was just in the prolongation of the line that separates the court 
            in two parts, and three times in the match I felt as if Marat's balls 
            where going to decapitate me as there is no protection such as a net 
            to protect the public. _by the way during the former match my neighbour 
            was hit in the middle of the chest and it took him a few seconds to 
            recover. It's dangerous to attend the TMS in Paris… ;-)<br>
            <br>
            The match seemed really short to me. And surprisingly quite boring 
            too…. I had come there to see Marat playing, not to see Marat waiting 
            for Vinciguerra's mistakes !!. From the third games, when he got broken 
            and smashed his racket we had understood that he was no longer involved 
            in the match: he was just undergoing Vinciguerra's law; and it was 
            pathetic. It went so fast that I didn't even take many pictures. A 
            dozen not more. But was it worth shooting a disappointed Marat ? I 
            don't think so. Anyway I'll scan them and send them to you as soon 
            as I'll have them.<br>
            <br>
            I am also really disappointed by this tournament, and I almost don't 
            want to attend the semifinals tomorrow, but I'd like to see Kafelnikov 
            because I've never seen him live, moreover he's the last major player 
            with Grosjean who remain in the draw.<br>
            <br>
            So to finish with, I have one wish: May Roland Garros come really 
            quickly with its fine weather, its charming village, its supporting 
            public, and above all a new Marat, fit, fresh, convincing and triumphant 
            !! <br>
            <br>
            Slestat for all Marat's fans.<br>
