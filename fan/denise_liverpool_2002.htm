            The Liverpool International 16th to 22nd June 2002.<br>
            <br>
            Well I set off on Tuesday as originally I was told that Marat would 
            only start playing on the Tuesday – but he started Monday! My train 
            was late by 1 and half hours so got to the hotel about 11.30 and play 
            started at 12 noon!<br>
            I was staying at the same hotel as the players as this was the one 
            recommended to me by the Liverpool Tennis office.<br>
            Anyhow I left my suitcase with the reception and went to have something 
            to eat before going to the tennis. While I was sitting in the lounge 
            Marat came down and sat on a bar stool at the little coffee shop area 
            to order a drink and something to eat and I went up and said hello 
            – asked how things were going – how was game coming along on the grass 
            court etc etc. He greeted me with a smile and said hello. He then 
            pulled up a chair in front of the TV to watch the soccer. Later Marc 
            and Allon joined him and after I finished my meal walked past and 
            chatted about the game with Marc and Marat and what they thought of 
            the World Cup. Then I went off to the tennis – they only came down 
            later. <br>
            The tournament was in beautiful Calderstones Park. Lots of practice 
            courts for the players though they also practiced at the Cricket Club 
            where they also had grass courts for them. The main court until 2 
            months ago had been a football pitch so all credit to the groundsmen 
            for preparing a reputable court which also managed to hold up to 35 
            matches being played on it! As most of them didn’t have a clue about 
            tennis it was quite a feat! Up until 2 months ago – nothing had happened 
            – the Liverpool Council only got permission from the LTA then and 
            Anders Borg who originally was only involved in the financial side 
            – suddenly found himself Tournament Director. We all watched him rushing 
            around sorting things out and rain on Friday did not help – poor Anders 
            think he aged a few years during the last couple of weeks. The fact 
            that it ran in a professional manner was all credit to Anders and 
            his team of helpers.<br>
            Well back to the tennis. <br>
            Marat and Marc played late in the afternoon against Andrew Ilie and 
            Ramon Delgado. The whole atmosphere of the tournament was very relaxed 
            as has already been reported. The players walked between the spectators 
            – a lot of them not even being recognized. The players laughed and 
            joked with one another and tried to entertain the crowd. As has been 
            reported in 1 game – Marat was 40.0 up on his serve – said something 
            to Marc Rosset and then made as if he was serving normally – suddenly 
            served under arm to Delgado who was so surprised but managed to get 
            it back then Marc rushed down the centre and slammed the ball down 
            the middle – Game won!! Of course Andrew made a remark and said to 
            Marat – just wait! He got his own back later and Marat said after 
            the point “Okay we’re even”!<br>
            In another game Marat sent down a really fast serve and Andrew did 
            a fantastic passing forehand leaving Marat and Marc stranded. Marat 
            looked at Andrew and clapped!!<br>
            Then they decided to give the crowd some excitement so on Marat’s 
            serve he said ”now Andrew” and on the return all four of them came 
            into the net and volleyed back and forth with some great shots until 
            finally Andrew won the point!<br>
            First set was intense but then in the 2nd Marat and Marc relaxed and 
            Marc’s serve was not too good and they lost. So it was 1 set all and 
            the players started a Super Tie Break – the umpire had no idea what 
            was going on. First Marat served then across to Delgado and the umpire 
            was saying 40.0 – no no said the players we are playing super tiebreak. 
            Well the umpire knew nothing about that and they tried to explain 
            and eventually Marc took the mike and explained to the crowd and they 
            continued! I spoke to the umpire later in the week. Apparently he 
            was pulled in at the last moment. Had reffed soccer matches – was 
            given a quick lesson and on he went. Nobody told him about Super Tiebreaks!! 
            Guess they don’t play those at normal levels! His son told him he 
            looked foolish – he said he didn’t feel that as the players took it 
            all in the right spirit and they laughed when he apologized later. 
            Both Marat and Marc had cans of coke as their drinks. In fact in another 
            match Marc made a special request for coke to be brought with the 
            water. Then during one of Marat’s matches – Marc asked him for a coke 
            and so he walked across and passed one up to him. Good volleying by 
            Marat – was impressed by the placement of the shots. On one of Marc’s 
            serves – very fast – Ilie’s return was a brilliant passing shot that 
            broke Marc’s serve. At the sit down Marc went over to Andrew and shook 
            his hand – all in good fun!Marc was upset they lost the doubles – 
            he is more moody than Marat but Marat didn’t worry! The final score 
            was 4.6 6.1 10.2 MTB<br>
            As Sue and Dee said Marat signed and had photos taken though Tuesday 
            he got a bit mobbed. By Wednesday they had got used to this super 
            star in their midst and ensured that there were 4 security guards 
            to keep an eye on things.<br>
            I met Lucie and her dad and made sure she got her autograph! She ahd 
            a wonderful time and was so pleased to have seen Marat in person. 
            Another fan sat behind me and I told her how to make sure she got 
            his autograph and she was so pleased as she touched his hand. Didn’t 
            get to meet Tina but think I saw where she was sitting so sorry we 
            did not meet up. Lots of Marat fans there.<br>
            Wednesday I left early as by now I had got talking to officials and 
            was woking for my living! Got to go in the Official transport and 
            walk in the players area.<br>
            On Wednesday saw some good tennis. Marc played Ramon Delgado before 
            Marat’s match so at first it was only Allon watching then along came 
            Marat climbed into the stand and all casual in his track suit proceed 
            to act as coach to Marc. Encouraging him, waving his arms – showing 
            Marc how he should have played a shot – making comments – putting 
            sunglasses on then off sticking them on his head – busy sending messages 
            on his mobile – casually joking with Allon. His coaching wasn’t much 
            good – Marc lost!! Stick to your tennis career Marat!<br>
            Then Marat played Scott Humphries – won first on the tiebreak then 
            lost the 2nd 5.7 (relaxed a bit) but then in the 3rd stepped up a 
            gear and showed what he was capable of. Several spectators were overawed 
            at the controlled strength and expertise of Marat. He was class even 
            playing in a relaxed manner but don’t be fooled by that. Marat wanted 
            to win and he was very determined. Wednesday was the players charity 
            party. I was supposed to go down – Anders had asked me to but I was 
            trying to sort out this report – I hadn’t taken my laptop – no computer 
            in the hotel so was a bit of a problem. All the players were gathering 
            in the lounge and I should have gone then but when I came back 10 
            minutes later they had gone. I was told off the next day – should 
            have been there but I spent the time doing a handwritten report. Pity 
            would have liked to have gone but can’t work and play!! All 16 players 
            went and Sandon bought a Liverpool football on the charity auction. 
            Then they all went out to dinner with Anders and other officials. 
            Went to the Living Room – the place to go in Liverpool these days. 
            Also Hicham Arazi and his coach Thierry went off to the Blue Bar on 
            Friday night after Hicham lost in the semis to Jan Mike.<br>
            Thursday I started early as had to type up the report at the grounds 
            then ended up interviewing all the players as to how they had enjoyed 
            the tournament – their thoughts and would they return. Marat reading 
            his book – starts talking says no talk to Allon – his English is better!! 
            Marat’s match on Thursday was against Frank Dancevic a 17 year old 
            Canadian. Exciting prospect – he was not overawed by playing Marat 
            and in fact made some very good shots and has a great serve. Was listening 
            to him talking to Hicham on Thursday night saying he was serving for 
            the 2nd set at 5.4 – was broken by Marat and then it went to the tiebreak 
            and he lost to 5 to Marat. Marat just stepped up another level – almost 
            as if he was saying – okay you have had your time now I will show 
            you how to play. All week Marat’s serving was great – no percentages 
            but very high. And the volleying impressed me – so good. Even those 
            below the net shots he was missing during the clay court season – 
            he was getting down to them and just dropping them over the net. Thursday 
            night the players gathered together and went off to dinner as it was 
            the last time they were all together. The others had either left or 
            were leaving the next morning to go to Wimbledon.<br>
            Vince Spadea also left on Thursday morning. Had to retire in his first 
            match on Monday against Jan Mike and he had tried to sort it out. 
            I had breakfast with Mr &amp; Mrs. Spadea on Thursday morning and 
            they were hoping that all would be okay for Vince at Wimbledon. Spent 
            some time with the Gambills as well and had a lovely long chat with 
            Jan Mike about his Big Cats venture – really loves them and of course 
            me coming from Zimbabwe we had a lot to talk about the cats in the 
            wild. Also I was wearing my Zimbabwe T shirts so they knew where I 
            was from.<br>
            Friday dawned cold and miserable and raining – wondered if we would 
            ever get them on court. The players were sitting around and Jan Mike 
            and Hicham finally got on court then after three games off and then 
            back on and so it went on. Diane Gambill and I kept going back &amp; 
            forth, back &amp; forth – eventually decided we were going to sit 
            and read our books. The players were watching soccer – again! Marat 
            was reading in Russian and peering under his book at the TV screen 
            stretched out on the sofa. Eventually Hicham and Jan Mike finished 
            their protracted match and Jan Mike was through to the Final. Then 
            Sandon and Marat decided to change in the tent – don’t worry about 
            me – I just carried on reading!! Thank goodness the sun came out as 
            Marat’s match started. He played with controlled power – suddenly 
            his game was awesome and Sandon had no chance. You still felt that 
            Marat had so much in hand. Was really impressed with his serve and 
            his all court game. The volleying and drop shots were superb. Friday 
            night I spent chatting to Scott Humphries at the bar – he was in the 
            doubles final as he pondered on his crossword puzzle in USA Today 
            – loves doing them. Marat did not go out to dinner stayed in his room. 
            Sat around in the lounge waiting to go to the tennis. All packed up 
            – checked out – would come back for the luggage later. I was reading 
            and Marat and Allon came in and ordered something to eat. Then Diane 
            Gambill came in and said I am going to the Beatles Museum – come with 
            me – it was five past one at this stage. Said I don’t do museums – 
            got persuaded – said going to the museum – see you later to Marat 
            and off we went. Had a quick tour and just made it to the grounds 
            by five past two- thought we were late but they were running ten minutes 
            late. Walked in and said “made it” - Marat was stretching and I got 
            a funny look as if “ You nearly didn’t make it!”<br>
            And what a wonderful match up we had in store. Marat Safin versus 
            Jan Michael Gambill.<br>
            And it was a really absorbing match. Both tall (6ft 4”) and big servers 
            – who would dominate? Both players were serving very well. No breaks 
            of serve though Marat had three break points when Jan Mike was 0.40 
            down and true to form of all the good players, he got himself out 
            of that situation with some excellent serving. Then later Jan Mike 
            had two break points on Marat’s serve. Apart from that it was terrific 
            tennis from both players. Both were volleying though statistics wise 
            – Marat probably had a better % at the net. His volleying and net 
            game have improved tremendously and he used the drop shot to great 
            advantage. In some cases he did not kill the bounce enough and Jan 
            Mike was able to get to the ball and use his own cross court drop 
            shot. One huge serve of Jan Mike’s was a fault but so fast it bounced 
            on the drying court and hit a spectator on the head!! Sorry folks 
            we forgot to tell you to bring along your shields to ward off the 
            servers!! Marat says that he doesn’t have a “touch” in his game but 
            I feel that on Saturday he disproved that saying. In particular one 
            so gentle drop shot that just popped over the net and literally died 
            – Jan Mike who was way back on the baseline had no chance – all he 
            could do was cry out! The set went to the tiebreak and Marat won it 
            8.6 with some excellent shots from both players. First set 7.6 to 
            Marat.<br>
            Second set and unfortunately the wind had got up a bit and the clouds 
            caused the sun to go in and out – making it a bit difficult for the 
            players. In the 6th game Marat had break points on Jan Mike’s serve 
            but could not convert – much to his annoyance! The volleys were not 
            going in as well – either long or wide and the racquet was bounced 
            a couple of times as Marat showed his annoyance with himself. Jan 
            Mike’s serving was steady and he held his service games easily. Marat 
            had a couple of games go to deuce but managed to get through without 
            being broken. Tiebreak once again. This time it got to 5.3 Jan Mike 
            and then Marat’s serve failed him and he double faulted twice. Second 
            set 7.6 (7.3) to Jan Mike.<br>
            So it was one set all and set for a thrilling finale Would it go to 
            another tiebreak or would someone get the break? Well it went with 
            serve – Marat had break points in the 5th game but did not convert 
            and then in the 7th game he broke Jan Mike. From then you knew who 
            the winner would be. Marat as befits the current leader of the Championship 
            Race had moved up a gear. Jan Mike managed to avoid being broken with 
            the score at 5.3 and Marat served out the match on his serve. 40.15 
            and tired for that ace to finish but instead a great second serve 
            finishing with a beautiful volley. Game set and match Marat Safin 
            – the first winner of the inaugural Liverpool International.<br>
            The players were presented with a memorial plate for Jan Mike and 
            a lovely trophy to Marat as the winner. The first name to be entered 
            on it? Who will be next. They were both presented with a liver bird 
            each as a momento of Liverpool.<br>
            The mayor was on hand as well as Steven Gerrard of Liverpool FC – 
            another famous member of Liverpool. Councillor Storey promised that 
            the Tournament would continue and the players both thanked the city, 
            the public and Anders Borg – Tournament Director for a wonderful tournament 
            which they had both enjoyed.<br>
            Then it was lots of signing for the fans milling around by the players 
            before Jan Mike was back on court as he was also in the Doubles Final.<br>
            He played doubles with Scott Humphries from LA and they were up against 
            a seasoned doubles pairing in Sandon Stolle and Joshua Eagle of Australia.<br>
            In a rousing encounter – Sandon and Joshua won 6.4 6.1.<br>
            Then mad dash – I had to get back to the hotel to get my luggage to 
            go to Lime Street Station to catch my train and Marat and Allon had 
            to pick up theirs, to go to Manchester Airport. So we set off in the 
            two cars and last I saw of Marat was heading off to the Airport and 
            I got a wave goodbye.<br>
            It was a great tournament – I worked hard and enjoyed the atmosphere 
            and relaxed feeling of the tournament. Here’s to next years tournament. 
            Marat is playing well – he says he is not “a grass court specialist” 
            told me that but I feel he has a great chance but he feels he wants 
            to play it down – to keep the pressure off.<br>
            Here’s to Wimbledon – he will give it his best. It was great being 
            around him and I saw another side of Marat. He really is a lovely 
            relaxed person who cares a lot about his fans. Allon will be with 
            him in Wimbledon – Amit will not be there.<br>
            Hope this helps to give you all an insight into Liverpool. The people 
            were all great and they drivers were all impressed that the players 
            were so approachable and not stuck up. The players all said the officials 
            and the people they met were really fantastic and made them feel so 
            at home. So a great time was had by all.<br>
