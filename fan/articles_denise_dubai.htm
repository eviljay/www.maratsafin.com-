            Dream<br>
            Report from Dubai by Denise<br>
            <br>
            In December last year, I read a report that Marat would be playing 
            in the Dubai Duty Free International in February/March 2001. Great 
            says I - my one chance of seeing Marat play live!<br>
            Well I did it - I went to Dubai - had a wonderful time and saw Marat 
            Safin live!<br>
            Everyone thought I was mad - spending all that money with Marat's 
            record as it was - he could go out in the first round. But I had faith 
            in Marat - I knew he would play well and he would get to the final!<br>
            My dream came true - he did play well and he did get to the final. 
            Unfortunately other circumstances took hold and the dream didn't have 
            the result I would have liked. But my dream of seeing him playing 
            live came true, and whatever else I will never forget that.<br>
            Here below are my daily reports from Dubai written by the one and 
            only &quot;Psychotic Marat Fan&quot;.</font>

              <b>Monday 02/26/2001</b></font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
              Had a really great day - been very hot and been watching in both 
              the main <br>
              Stadium and Outside Courts.<br>
              Saw Magnus Norman defeat Jeff Tarango who threw a bit of a tantrum 
              and then gave up. Then Max Myrni played really well and took out 
              Cedric Pioline - of course in the interview afterwards he was asked 
              if he was making a habit of knocking out the seeded players in the 
              first round!! See in the magazine write up for the Dubai Open say 
              Max is learning Spanish at the moment - Marat's influence??<br>
              Then went over to the outside court to see who was practicing and 
              on the far <br>
              Court - wonder of wonders - Marat with Kafelnikov!! Actually the 
              outside courts <br>
              are so accessible - the players just walk straight from the Aviation 
              Club grounds onto the court! They are staying at the Al Bustan Rotana 
              Hotel which is 5 minutes away around the corner. The atmosphere 
              is very relaxed - the Aviation Club has a swimming pool, massage 
              area, sauna, mini golf course so ideal for the players waiting to 
              go on court for their game.Lots of them relax with the golf - a 
              tennis players second favourite pastime!<br>
              Then tonight in the main stadium watched Kafelnikov come back from 
              being 4.0 down in the first set against Dosedel to win it 7.6 then 
              hurried out of the stadium because knew Marat would be playing his 
              doubles. Well got to Court No. 3 and they were just walking on. 
              Literally there was myself, another woman, a couple of ball boys 
              and Volkov and another member of Marat's team who I recognised but 
              can't remember his name. Gerard came a bit later and then went off. 
              Sounds all so calm when I write it but I wasn't - just couldn't 
              believe that at last I was a mere three metres away from Marat - 
              on the court relaxed and joking - kept chatting away to Volkov &amp; 
              Co. pulling faces etc. Later when Kafelnikov's match ended in the 
              main stadium more people filed in - lot of Russians but at the most 
              probably 300 people - well Marat &amp; Groen - didn't recognise 
              Groen supposed to be Dutch but it wasn't Dutch that he was shouting 
              at himself - in fact he looked a bit like Medvedev - he also broke 
              a racquet - Marat did as well - really bust his racquet when he 
              lost his serve - and so did Groen - he did a lot more shouting than 
              Marat - Marat was actually quite calm - lots of talking. Think it 
              must be the first time Marat has been playing a game and there is 
              loud music going on from the stadium and everyone is feeling relaxed 
              and enjoying the sound around them! Well in the end they lost - 
              6.4 4.6 3.6 Marat got broken twice and the racquet got broken too. 
              Didn't get his signature - he signed a few and then walked off through 
              the courts back to the club but think I was too dazed at the thought 
              that whatever else my trip was worthwhile - I had seen Marat live 
              in front of <br>
              me playing tennis! WOW!!<br>
              Maybe I am a &quot;Psychotic Fan&quot; but whatever else it is a 
              case of feeling almost &quot;euphoric.&quot;</font></p>

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
              Tomorrow he plays Prinosil - don't know the order yet but I will 
              be there. <br>
              Crowds very small - can't believe that they haven't marketed it 
              more - and the stadium and everything is so accessible - it really 
              is great. Players walk through the crowds and the Irish Village 
              is a great pub and good fun. Lots of partying going on!!<br>
              So at this stage Marat is still with Volkov - he was playing better 
              - more fluid and seemed to have more confidence - still not getting 
              all his first serves in but there were flashes of brilliance and 
              the signs were there so <br>
              lets hope that he has turned the corner - tomorrow will tell. Far 
              more relaxed - think he likes the atmosphere!<br>
              Anyhow - our man is here -he looks good - needs a haircut - hair 
              is curling up at the back like it was at the Masters Cup in Lisbon 
              - and lets hope he goes all the way!</font></p>

              <b>Tuesday 02/27/2001</b><br>
              Got to the stadium around 12 noon and it was really hot today - 
              no wind so the sun was a bit much. Anyhow went up to the top of 
              Gate 8 so that I had a view of all the courts as everyone was practicing 
              and also view to the club where all the players would come down 
              to the practice courts. Before that had just about tripped up Jonas 
              Bjorkman coming from practice (he lost to Ferrero today did not 
              see the match as it was on Court 1 at the same time Marat was playing 
              so guess where I was!!). Anyhow watched the practicing for a while 
              - below me were Max Mirnyi and Kafelnikov practicing - they later 
              played doubles against Boutter/Suk and won in three sets on the 
              outside court No.3 - and then nothing much happening so went off 
              to visit my friends in the Sportsworld Office. All the girls in 
              the ticket office are from Singapore - they work for the Dubai Duty 
              Free at the airport and who are sponsors of this tournament. They 
              are very good greet me and provide me with coffee and food and bottles 
              of water - the security guard is getting used to me lets me through 
              - not bad considering that is also the entrance for the players 
              to the court!<br>
              Anyhow after I had sat talking to my Sportsworld friends went back 
              up to the top of Gate 8 overlooking the hotel and saw these two 
              walking from the club - I recognise that distinctive walk - oh yes 
              Marat and Volkov coming for practice!!<br>
              Well watched them practice for 1/2 an hour and Volkov really had 
              him working on all his moves - Marat was moving better - moving 
              his feet - he looked happier and he was really concentrating on 
              his practice which was great. Then the first game started on the 
              center court between a very out of sorts Corretja (couldn't do anything 
              right) and Lars Burgsmuller who won. </font></p>
            <p align="center"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><img src="img2/Dubai4.jpg" width="259" height="288"></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
              Then it was Marat's match. He walked out just below me and there 
              he was - looking really great. Well he played a fantastic match 
              - the serves were coming - kept his cool in fact didn't even slam 
              the ground with his racquet at all. Prinosil was out of sorts - 
              he couldn't get anything right but tried hard in the first set. 
              Actually having watched Marat practice earlier could see him building 
              up to his points - it was amazing. He moved his feet, was trying 
              different things and really seemed to have his confidence back. 
              He was in a bit of a hurry maybe he had a date tonight!! Reminded 
              me of that time at the at the Paris Open when he played Ferrero 
              and they kept saying he was in such a hurry must be going out for 
              dinner!! It was great that he played so well but wanted it to go 
              on for another set! Anyhow everybody was crowding around for autographs 
              and I had lost my pen but this one girl's sister was down near the 
              front so she took my magazine and I took photos. I clicked away 
              and actually have a photo of Marat signing my book on his photo.<br>
              The tennis was great - Marat was flowing - the strokes were coming 
              as before and it made me feel so good! Just hope he doesn't party 
              too much tonight as he plays Bouttier tomorrow at 7pm.<br>
              Later at 7pm Pat Rafter of the shaven hairstyle played Kiefer and 
              knocked him out in two straight sets - felt sorry for Kiefer - defending 
              champion - and he couldn't do anything right. Kept bouncing his 
              racquets together like he had had them wrongly strung - like Marat 
              at the Hopman Cup this year.<br>
              When I left Andrei Medvedev looked like he was going to win comfortably 
              against Nestor. So two days of wonderful excitement - all that is 
              left is to actually talk to Marat - wonder if that will happen and 
              for Marat to carry on winning - then this week will be fantastic. 
              If Marat carries on he should meet Kafelnikov in the semis and Norman 
              should meet Ferrero in the other semi - that is the prediction. 
              So another day is over and it was great. Here's to tomorrow and 
              lets hope the excitement continues!<br>
              </font></p>

            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
              <b>Wednesday 02/28/2001</b><br>
              Today - Marat played Julien Boutter and he won - a bit of a struggle 
              and aided by some terrible line calls as well as losing his cool 
              but he got there in the end!<br>
              Quite honestly I am afraid that the linesmen on duty needed the 
              &quot;optician's award&quot; for today. The line calling was atrocious 
              - no consistency - one minute on the line was in then it was out. 
              Marat had a perfect ace down the middle on the line and anywhere 
              else it would have been in but no &quot;Fault&quot; went the call 
              - Marat couldn't believe it! Needless to say we had a lot of talking 
              - didn't smash any racquets - amazingly enough! - but skied a ball 
              from my side the north side right over the top of the royal enclosure 
              and that is high - went off into the night - of course got a code 
              violation too! Then in another incident - again a bad line call 
              - slammed the next ball so hard for a winner that it bounced right 
              into the royal enclosure and up the stairs and almost hit the royal 
              princes - just missed them - had to lift his racquet and apologize!! 
              Not the way to treat the royal family Marat - you do want to leave 
              eventually - don't you??<br>
              But it wasn't just Marat - Boutter also lost his cool - saw Rafter 
              lose his drastically earlier - even broke a racquet and for Rafter 
              that is something, so it has been rather a fault of the tournament. 
              Will need to sort that out if they are to keep up the standard of 
              the tournament next year.<br>
              Well it was a day full of suprises - I didn't watch Kafelnikov being 
              knocked out by Johansson as I went to court No. 1 to see Ferrero 
              beat Novak - also I got to sit in the shade - on the main stadium 
              I am in the sun all afternoon and needed a respite. Plus I like 
              Fererro and all his games have been on the outside courts and missed 
              them. He came through easily and then of course right outside the 
              court stood next to him and got him to sign his picture - such a 
              very pleasant young man - ended up using my pen to sign for everybody 
              so it was well used. Anyhow then went to watch Rafter/Medvedev left 
              there to watch the end of Mirnyi/Voltchkov which Mirnyi won easily 
              and also was watching for Marat to come and practice - at this stage 
              it was 17.50hrs and Marat due to play at 19.00hrs and he still hadn't 
              come out to practice. Somehow I think there was partying last night 
              and somebody was sleeping in. Well eventually came out to practice 
              and managed to get some work done. The little guy who's name I can't 
              remember kept yawning like mad the whole time and kept talking to 
              Marat and Volkov actually must have said something because the little 
              guy left. But Marat looked a bit sluggish and was trying to watch 
              the doubles on the near court as well so wasn't a good start for 
              the match. But in the end it came right - he was lucky in a lot 
              of ways and will have to play better against Medvedev tomorrow. 
              The upshot is he could play Mirnyi in the semis, which should be 
              interesting. <br>
              Norman was lucky - lost the first set badly but then came back. 
              First game on tomorrow is Mirnyi against Johansson and then Marat 
              against Medvedev which should be about 16.00hrs. Ferrero and Norman 
              play at 19.00hrs and then a doubles match to end so should be a 
              good day.<br>
              One interesting thing - don't know if the match was live anywhere 
              but directly across from me in the Royal/VIP stand two rows up on 
              the right of the central stairs Marat's team of two others plus 
              Volkov were sitting. Volkov was doing a bit of nailbiting during 
              the match I can tell you. But next to Volkov was this dark haired 
              girl - couldn't see clearly but looked remarkably like Sylvia but 
              she and Volkov didn't seem to be talking to one another and I couldn't 
              see her clearly, so could have been just a look a like - but it 
              was interesting! Anybody see anything??<br>
              Well tomorrow the Dubai Duty Free Shopping Spree starts - coloured 
              lights are being put up everywhere and it is really beautiful - 
              all the barges in the creek are lit up and the trees all have gold 
              lights in the leaves and I suppose looks a bit like our Christmas 
              lights. Really makes everything look so festive.<br>
              We are into the Q/Finals - keep going Marat because then it is the 
              Semis and who knows this could be your lucky week!<br>
              So ended another hot day with the sun shining out of a clear blue 
              sky and Will go on to even better tennis we hope.<br>

              <b>Thursday 03/01/2001</b><br>
              Well as you know Marat won well and truly, beating Medvedev in straight 
              sets - 6.1 &amp; 6.2 - Marat is definitely coming back - that was 
              so much better - still a few hiccups along the way but definitely 
              the confidence is there. He felt it too as he said in his courtside 
              interview afterwards.<br>
              So tomorrow at 7.00pm local time Marat will play Johansson.<br>
              Today was the first day of the Dubai Shopping Spree and it becomes 
              chaos as everybody goes shopping. The official launch was tonight 
              so the stadium was not completely full as so many people could not 
              get from the other side of the city to the stadium because of back 
              to back traffic. The lights are blazing everywhere - Palm trees 
              have their trunks all wrapped in gold and red lights and then the 
              lower palm fronds have lots of lights in them. The golf tournament 
              with Tiger Woods is about to start and everything is happening! 
              And the tennis today was great. It was also very hot and very humid 
              - and continued into the evening.<br>
              And now I have set the scene let us continue with the tennis. Got 
              to the stadium at 12noon and went to my favourite spot on top of 
              the stairs to gate 8 to look out over the practice courts, check 
              out the central stadium and watch the entrance to see who was coming 
              on court to practice. Well as usual JC Ferrero was out practicing 
              - he really is a workaholic when it comes to his tennis and it paid 
              off tonight - he is also such a nice guy in his broken English - 
              nothing is too much trouble. <br>
              The main matches were due to start on the Centre Court at 2pm but 
              ran a bit late and I thought I bet Marat will be late coming to 
              practice. True enough 13.15 he wanders along with Volkov - talking 
              on his &quot;mobile&quot;! - well while he continued talking and 
              laughing - Volkov had changed from his sandals to socks and trainers 
              and got the balls out and Marat was still talking! Volkov started 
              hitting balls at him so still talking Marat pulled his shoes off 
              and one handed started putting his trainers on - by now the balls 
              were being bounced up and down. Eventually Marat finished and got 
              up. Think they were already late as they were supposed to be finished 
              by 2pm before the match started on Court 3 and so they only got 
              about 40 minutes in instead of 1 hour. Anyhow Marat was very sluggish 
              to start with and Volkov had him moving around a lot. <br>
              Had to laugh from my high perch atop the stairs - Marat started 
              talking to Medvedev on the other court and Volkov slammed two balls 
              across the net towards Marat. One got stuck up high in the netting 
              around the court. Marat tried to dislodge it by hitting the netting 
              but it wouldn't come loose so next thing he had to climb up like 
              a monkey - no wrong desription - monkeys are small and he definitely 
              isn't small - anyhow you get my meaning I am sure and eventually 
              got the ball down.</font></p>
            <p align="center"><img src="img2/Dubai11.jpg" width="284" height="190"></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> Volkov 
              had him practicing his buildups down <br>
              each side of the court and then the final slam down the inside either 
              forehand or backhand. Well the practice worked because Marat got 
              several winners that way against Medvedev. Left that and went to 
              watch Johansson against Mirnyi - Mirnyi had no answer and it was 
              all over very quickly. Then Marat came on and as he walked on the 
              court I said to myself the score will be 6.1 6.2 - sure enough the 
              first set was correct - was almost 6.0 but Marat didn't convert 
              the break points he had and allowed Medvedev a game. Then in the 
              second thought it would be 6.1 but again Marat didn't convert the 
              break points he had and it ended up as 6.2. Not bad prediction huh?? 
              Not so many aces - in fact when he finally got an ace he threw his 
              hands up in the air and clapped. Lot more first serves in - he's 
              serving slower but accurately and I think this is what Volkov has 
              said to him - lose a bit of pace but be accurate. When he gets his 
              first serve in he can build his point. Actually was quite patient 
              as well so that was great. All in all that was Marat really coming 
              back - have been saying it all week but it is there and I definitely 
              feel he is starting to believe in himself again.<br>
              Well everyone the dark haired girl was there again today sitting 
              next to Volkov and they were talking and in the daylight (as she 
              was once again dressed all in black) - it was I am sure Sylvia - 
              (since confirmed by seeing pictures on ATP highlights - it was Sylvia.)Anyhow 
              Volkov's wife was also there - beautiful tall blond and his son!! 
              So family occasion!<br>
              In between the first match and Marat's, Johansson and Joshua Eagle 
              played a tie break with two youngsters from Dubai who had been specially 
              picked - they were both 12 and played some really good strokes and 
              the two guys were encouraging them all the way. Then had their pictures 
              taken with one of the princes and the players so the kids were really 
              pleased with their day!<br>
              Later as the two singles had gone so quickly, the doubles match 
              between Kafelnikov/Mirnyi and Bhuphati/Paes was moved to Center 
              court. Went and had something to eat - hadn't eaten all day as too 
              busy &quot;Marat watching&quot; and then came back to watch K &amp; 
              M win a tight match - Mirnyi Snr was very pleased his son won - 
              was not very happy when he lost his singles match!<br>
              Tonight's match between Ferrero /Norman was a close one and lots 
              of base line rallies - hard work. In the middle of the match the 
              fireworks started for the launch of the Shopping Spree and suddenly 
              there was all this noise of bangs and whees and overhead above the 
              canopy on the VIP stand. There were these masses of lights as the 
              rockets exploded! How the players concentrated I don't know - sounded 
              like it was all happening right inside the stadium and the kids 
              were all oohing and aahing at the fireworks. Also choppers flying 
              low around the stadium - quite an atmosphere!!<br>
              So tomorrow we see if Marat can get into his first final of the 
              year - I feel the time is right - lets hope my feelings are correct!<br>
<br>

              <b>Friday 03/02/2001</b><br>
              A DAY OF DRAMAS -<br>
              Hello everyone - this is the mental wreck speaking!! I always wondered 
              how would I would cope if it ended up dramatic - I don't know how 
              I didn't have a heart attack - the girls from the ticket office 
              said they saw me getting very excited and thought better leave me 
              alone. Told me this when I went to have a coffee after the match 
              and - wait for it - saying a few words to Marat standing right next 
              to me!!! <br>
              Well what a day - lot cooler today - clouds came up and didn't have 
              that sun all day. Got there at about 12noon as Friday everything 
              is closed. Anyhow nobody practicing and knew Marat wouldn't come 
              out to practice until about 5.30pm so wandered around and talked 
              to a few people and then went in the main stadium to watch Kafelnikov/Mirnyi 
              against Stolle/Eagle. Kafelnikov played so badly - poor Mirnyi was 
              trying desperately to win but Kafelnikov kept netting or hitting 
              his returns long. Think he must have an ice hockey game to watch 
              on Saturday or something. Later I was walking past through the Irish 
              Village and he was marching along with a golf club in his hand swinging 
              it around through the crowd - nearly hit me and I jokingly said 
              &quot;careful you are dangerous with that&quot; - didn't even get 
              a laugh and there is nothing wrong with his knowledge of the English 
              language!!<br>
              Well then it was the first semi final between Ferrero and Hrbaty. 
              Well what a nailbiter - the crowd was all behind Ferrero especially 
              after he came back and Hrbaty didn't stand a chance. I was shouting 
              for Ferrero because wanted him to be in the final with Marat. Then 
              the match finished and rushed down to the practice courts to see 
              Marat practicing - he had just come on and it was 5.45pm. Anyhow 
              he practiced until 6.25pm and then someone came and said would be 
              on in half an hour so he had to go and shower and change. Left Volkov 
              knocking around with the short guy and went off. I grabbed a chicken 
              schwarma to eat and went back to the stadium. My stomach wouldn't 
              take anything else I was a bundle of nerves!!</font></p>
            <p align="center"><img src="img2/Dubai12.jpg" width="290" height="209"></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
              Then on he walked. Opposite sat Volkov, Sylvia this time at least 
              in a brighter shirt with the inevitable black but hair back so looked 
              prettier and she was more animated today - chatting away to Volkov 
              and even had an almost smile on her face! Also there was Gerard 
              and short guy - wish I knew his name - think I should nickname him 
              &quot;the Clown&quot; as he always clowns around - should have seen 
              him on the practice court pretending the racquet was a guitar and 
              swaying his hips to the eastern music coming from the village side. 
              There is always music going on there - get used to it. <br>
              Anyhow the first set was a disaster - Marat was surpassingly calm 
              only smashed down one racquet and that slid along the ground so 
              didn't get a warning. <br>
              Actually Ferrero got a warning in his match - smashed a ball almost 
              over the VIP canopy - the ball came running back down off the canopy 
              and the ball boy caught it - got a round of applause so everybody 
              missed Ferrero getting his code violation. He lost his serve and 
              when he got back to his seat slammed down the towel, his racquet 
              and slammed the fridge lid when getting his drink - it is getting 
              to everybody!!<br>
              The tie break in the first set was a disaster for Marat - 7.0 - 
              I was chewing my nails - digging my nails into my palms - almost 
              jumping up and down. Marat kept looking at Volkov and lifting his 
              hands. Then second set he should have served out early and then 
              ended up with another tiebreak - lost the first point and then fought 
              back. The roar in the stadium was amazing. Actually had another 
              round of fireworks during the first set and had to contend with 
              helicopters overhead and somebody in either a drag racer or whatever 
              making such a noise - think it was getting to Marat in the first 
              set and then he settled down. Well the start of the third set and 
              he loses his service - couldn't believe it! Don't know who was chewing 
              more nails - Volkov or me. <br>
              Well as if all those tensions were not enough then Marat pulled 
              up after the one point and then next holds his back and limps off. 
              I had tears in my eyes at this stage - I thought no I can't bear 
              it - to go out injured! Well he came back but what really won that 
              match was him serving so slowly - Johansson did not know how to 
              play it and it totally frustrated him - he marched off in a huff 
              after the match! </font></p>
            <p align="center"><img src="img2/Dubai7.jpg" width="285" height="230"></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">When 
              Marat won I jumped up and I really had tears in my <br>
              eyes - a mixture of relief and joy. I felt so drained just couldn't 
              believe it. Well he came over and signed and signed autographs and 
              I got a couple of photos and then the film ran out. So went down 
              to the back to the ladies and everyone was waiting for Marat to 
              come out. So stood right in line, Dubai cap and marker in hand and 
              thought why did my film run out? This guy standing next to me had 
              bought a cap for his young brother and said can I borrow your marker 
              - do you think he will sign? I said yes he will sign he is very 
              good that way - oh how do you know - well I am a member of his very 
              big fan club and he is very good like that. The security guy agreed 
              - if he stops, he will sign. So then he came out and walked straight 
              towards me and stood right up close and I felt like putting my arms 
              round him and giving him a great big kiss but I didn't as I am too 
              much of a lady?? So instead he signed the cap and I said well played 
              but please don't give me heart failure like that again couldn't 
              stand it and he said no I won't but tomorrow it will be okay to 
              play and I said that is good because I am looking forward to tomorrow 
              and then he was gone. And I was in even more of a daze. What a week 
              - it was all so worthwhile - wished I had said thank you for playing 
              so well but did not think at the time. And to hell with those people 
              who think he is arrogant - he is so sweet and really a little boy 
              lost and he fought so hard today and he is in his first final for 
              the year and I am here in Dubai to watch it!! <br>
              Tomorrow the doubles are first at 7pm and then the singles at 9pm 
              so will be a long night. <br>
              Another wonderful day in Dubai - good night all - guess who I will 
              be dreaming about!! <br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Saturday 
              03/03/2001</b><br>
              I am afraid after all the excitement of the previous days -it was 
              an anti - climax. Knew when I watched him practice at just before 
              8pm that he was not right. He was trying hard and Volkov was trying 
              to explain to him how he could play but automatically Marat would 
              try to go for a ball in his normal manner - like an overhead smash 
              - Volkov was shaking his head and I think really and truly Volkov's 
              advice was don't play but Marat didn't want to disappoint everyone 
              so he played. For those of you who saw it live you will know he 
              was so uncomfortable - couldn't serve - his top speed for the serve 
              was 143kmh and of course his natural instinct was to stretch and 
              go for the high ball. The crunch came in the second set where he 
              automatically tried to take an overhead backhand smash and you could 
              almost hear him wince! I had tears in my eyes again but this time 
              because he was trying so hard to be the &quot;Super Trouper&quot; 
              but in reality he should have not come out. Should have been on 
              a plane back home having treatment.<br>
              He tried his best to make it right for Juan-Carlos because they 
              are friends and laughed when JC won the toss and chose to receive 
              - Marat's usual trick - could imagine the comment. When Marat walked 
              to the net he had several times gone to the VIP stand side and said 
              something to Volkov and I think in the end he listened because Volkov 
              said &quot;no&quot; and Marat called the trainer who also said no. 
              He then went and sat with Juan Carlos and the two of them sat and 
              had a long conversation in Spanish - couldn't hear it but it is 
              funny when he speaks Spanish his actions change completely - they 
              were having a long conversation while the dancers were doing their 
              bit. The whole time Marat spoke live he kept apologizing to everyone 
              who had bought tickets that he couldn't make a match of it and sorry 
              that they only got half a match but he would come back and give 
              them a better time. Asked us all to wish his friend/coach &quot;don't 
              know what he is to me&quot; a very Happy Birthday today and also 
              good luck in his new job. And he also told him to have a good dinner 
              tonight. Seem to think Marat will be heading out pretty quickly 
              to go and sort out his injury - Ferrero said was going home and 
              then to Indian Wells - Marat said he didn't know would have to see 
              how the injury responds before he sees whether he plays Indian Wells 
              or not. So we will have to see. <br>
              Despite all that anti climax - it was worth it. I have had a wonderful 
              time - saw Marat live - saw him play better and better - got his 
              autograph - talked to him and found Dubai to be a really wonderful 
              place. To anyone who wants to - it is a wonderful place to come 
              - you will enjoy the tournament and the friendly people and where 
              else in the world can you see all the games so easily. Marat said 
              he would be back so maybe I will be too!<br>
              Cheers and goodnight from Dubai</font></p>
