            He did it - he won his first trophy on Sunday 3rd November at Bercy 
            in Paris and I was there - a memory to outlive all the other times 
            I have met and seen Marat play. Nothing can compare to this - it was 
            definitely the icing on the cake!<br>
            <br>
            A week ago on Sunday as I sat waiting in Birmingham airport because 
            my flight was delayed for 2 ? hours after horrendous winds the night 
            before and all morning, I must admit I had a slight (ever so slight) 
            depressing thought that I was spending all this money and with the 
            form Marat was in - he could be gone so quickly. Think it had something 
            to do with the waiting around. Eventually arrived at the hotel about 
            10pm and two things happened to make me feel much better. The hotel 
            receptionist advised me they were upgrading me at no extra cost so 
            I got to be on the 10th floor - wow -and then a voice behind me says 
            &quot;hello Denise&quot; and it was Matt together with Ruth &amp; 
            Violaine from manfromrussia.com. What a lovely surprise. Matt even 
            acted as porter and took my bags up for me - think he was hoping to 
            see some players but we saw no one! I came back down for a drink and 
            then later when I went upstairs couldn't get the lift to work and 
            doubles player Petr Pala had to show me how to use my door key before 
            the lift would accept your floor no. - very good security. <br>
            <br>
            So Monday went down and sat in the lobby drinking coffee and watched 
            the world go by. Then Amit arrived at the hotel together with this 
            distinguished grey haired gentleman and was very attentive. In fact 
            he spent the whole day looking after him and didn't go with Marat 
            to practice. Marat surprised us all by coming down with Anatoly and 
            we didn't even know he had arrived - crept in at some hour unnoticed 
            - good one Marat! One person did see arrive was Andy Roddick. Then 
            later on Andy wandered downstairs - picked up Le Quotidien - glanced 
            at it as he realised I can't read French - then paced up &amp; down 
            and round &amp; about until a courtesy car pulled up outside and in 
            walked Mandy with luggage. Big smile from Andy - walks up and gives 
            her a kiss and then they headed upstairs to the room! One happy Andy!<br>
            <br>
            We were all wondering who the important man was - he looked so familiar 
            - no wonder it was Mr Khakshouri snr - hadn't we all seen his photo 
            on the Tashkent site? <br>
            That night they all went out to dinner - and a good time was had by 
            all. <br>
            Next day in the lift coming down Nicholas Lapenti got in at the 9th 
            floor - dressed, cap on head, barefoot carrying his shoes. Smiled 
            and said hello and said to him &quot;something wrong with the shoes?&quot; 
            No says he it is more comfortable this way meaning the barefeet. I 
            said I agree totally my favourite way. He got off at the 3rd floor 
            - still carrying his shoes!! From then on everytime I was walking 
            round my room barefoot and Ruth phoned I would say I was doing a Lapenti!! 
            New phrase everyone! <br>
            <br>
            Well Marat went out to practice on Tuesday and came back in a foul 
            mood! I had gone upstairs to get something from my room and walked 
            out of the lift and into Marat and Amit. Said hi to Amit and then 
            because hadn't talked previously to Marat Safin - I said Hi Marat 
            nice to talk to you at last. - all I got was a mutter about people 
            etc and stalked off to the lift! Amit raised an eyebrow and smiled 
            at me and acted as if he was kicking Marat into the lift. Well I didn't 
            get an actual apology from Marat but twice got a beautiful big smile 
            later on while he was waiting to go out so guess that was saying sorry!! 
            Lucy in the meantime was having a horrendous time trying to get to 
            Paris - her flight was also delayed and thank goodness for SMS on 
            our mobiles. Kept her informed of all that was happening and she kept 
            telling me when she should be arriving. It was great meeting her as 
            well when I saw her the next day.<br>
            <br>
            Wednesday while waiting to go to the stadium, I was sitting having 
            coffee when Marat &amp; Amit came back from practice. Marat sort of 
            smiled and Amit looked around and saw me and came across and gave 
            me a ticket to the players box as a non player!! What a lovely surprise 
            - couldn't believe it! When I got to my seat in the front (my normal 
            one) Lucy was sitting there and went to move and I said no don't you 
            can sit here for Andy's match I will be over there!! And so that is 
            how the blonde got to sit in the box. Trouble is wanted to stir it 
            a bit about another blonde in the Marat camp, but everyone recognises 
            me - think I should dye my hair another colour - Ruth says I have 
            my own fan club!! It was a wonderful thing to sit in the players box 
            watching Marat in front - a great experience. And I was lucky enough 
            to have the same experience the next night too - definitely a case 
            of the cherry on the top! A big thankyou to Amit for providing the 
            tickets to Matt &amp; I. And on top of it Marat won both times. Only 
            trouble is had to be very controlled - and keep all those emotions 
            locked in - too many eyes on you! I was told by Christiane and Ruth 
            &amp; Vee that I did a splendid job!! Actually glad I wasn't there 
            for the other matches especially the semi &amp; final - I couldn't 
            have done it! <br>
            <br>
            I knew that Marat was somewhere on the 10th floor with me as I had 
            seen Amit walking towards me the one day but didn't know where. Had 
            seen Ferrero, Hewitt and Moya all on my floor at some time. Agassi 
            &amp; Steffi and Jaden Gill didn't stay at the hotel with the other 
            players.<br>
            <br>
            Other tidbits - Wednesday Andy &amp; Mandy coming to breakfast together 
            and Andy introducing her to everyone. James Blake and I twice having 
            breakfast alongside one another - the first time because the space 
            was so small between the tables did a sort of dance as we tried to 
            both get out at the same time and laughed about the narrow spaces!<br>
            <br>
            After Marat's late night match on Thursday against Schalken, they 
            got back after midnight. When I went up to my room about 1am, I saw 
            a room service table outside the room opposite mine with the remains 
            of a coke, chips and a salad. Thought only 1 player would be eating 
            this late! Anyhow was fiddling around at my cupboards standing in 
            my underwear, when I heard a door open, voices speaking Russian so 
            did a quick move to the spyhole just in time to see Amit &amp; Anatoly 
            walk past! My neighbour was none other than Marat Safin! Then had 
            a giggle at me standing there in my underwear so close to him. Slept 
            very well that night - Marat was there watching over me!<br>
            <br>
            Other tidbits - Ruth would type her reports in the bar lounge area 
            on Vee's laptop. The plug was in the centre of the floor. One night 
            Guga tripped over the plug not once but 3 times - bent the plug completely 
            - told Vee to ask him to replace it - he could afford it - but she 
            didn't!<br>
            <br>
            Friday watched the match against Escude then watched the first set 
            of Hewitt v Federer before heading back to the hotel. Was popping 
            back &amp; forth to the TV at the transport desk to check out Andy 
            v Srichaphan - the TV in the bar area was not working. Ellis Ferreira 
            was sitting there waiting to go out with Vizner his doubles partner 
            and as we have spoken several times before started having a conversation. 
            Well discovered come from the same part of SA - he went to a school 
            near mine and so on - it was very interesting and showed me pics of 
            his lovely blonde little girls - definitely the apple of dad's eye! 
            So it was a big shock the next day to find that he went up for an 
            overhead smash in his doubles semi final against Escude/Santoro and 
            his back seized and in his own words he came down like a sack of potatoes. 
            Felt terrible - tennis injuries can happen so suddenly. Later after 
            Andy's loss - we were feeling a bit bored. Marat, Anatoly, Amit and 
            dark haired lady friend had come down and gone out after Marat creeping 
            up on the quietly sitting Anatoly and giving him the shock of his 
            life and we had had the cheery smile goodbye. Anyhow decided to go 
            for a walk as it had stopped raining for a bit. Well walking along 
            and go past this restaurant with clear glass panes and I say people 
            eating like this must hate people walking past staring at them eating 
            and then looked and there were Marat, Amit, Anatoly and dark haired 
            woman - well I went Aah and started walking fast and the other two 
            did the same. How embarrassing it was so unintentional - nothing was 
            said except for a couple of cryptic comments the next day but it was 
            terrible - it really was a case of were our faces red!! It was a Japanese 
            restaurant by the way -one of Marat's favourites is sushi!<br>
            <br>
            Saturday it was raining so I went up to my room to try and find my 
            umbrella. Couldn't find it so spent a lot longer up there than I was 
            going to. Since finding out that Marat was opposite, I had been very 
            careful about when I went out of my room and also the restaurant embarrassing 
            bit - didn't want another one. So this time heard the door and footsteps 
            and thought they had gone - turns out only Anatoly had gone. I open 
            the door turn to switch off the light switch and look straight at 
            Marat who grins like mad and says - so this is where you are! Well 
            we walked down the corridor with me getting ragged by Amit and Marat 
            chuckling away. Stop at the lift very polite and stand aside for me 
            to go in first. The ragging continued all the way down. Marat thought 
            it was a huge joke - he would! And at the end as I got out lift just 
            said Play Well today Marat and he said I will! He did he won!<br>
            <br>
            Sunday were sitting waiting to go to the stadium - time was dragging 
            and trying not to get nervous. Marat, Amit and Anatoly came out and 
            went off to practice and the match - very tense - it was so important 
            to them all. Earlier had seen Ellis wandering round in his dressing 
            gown and found out that it wasn't as serious as a disc but a very 
            bad muscle shutdown. Says he will think of retiring - will be sad 
            - he is a good doubles player! Anyhow he was bored and said could 
            he come and join me for a coffee - said yes - then Ruth came back 
            and I introduced her and then Vee arrived. Ellis kept us entertained 
            for the couple of hours before we had to leave it was difficult to 
            break away but it helped us pass the time and he was so interesting. 
            While we were talking Larry Passos came up to talk to Ellis and ask 
            how he was and said hello to us. Then Guga arrived - had a conversation 
            with Ellis in half Portuguese/Spanish and then in English for our 
            benefit says don't worry you think it gets better then it gets worse 
            with a huge grin - I told him he was a real cheerful Charlie!! Said 
            again when he left for the stadium - don't forget you will feel worse 
            - bad bedside manner Guga!! And then to the match - well I went the 
            whole range of emotions and when he won I stood there with tears streaming 
            down my face. I tried to take photos but my hands were shaking so 
            much and I couldn't see properly for the tears so they were rubbish. 
            Tried to take a pic of Amit with his arm around Anatoly hugging him 
            both with big grins on their faces - it was so lovely - just got the 
            red railing - sorry everyone!<br>
            <br>
            It was wonderful, it was marvellous, it was the most superb end to 
            a wonderful week and if I never do it again - it was the most fantastic 
            feeling watching Marat hold those trophies above his head - definitely 
            a case of my cup runneth over!<br>
            <br>
            Other tidbits during the week - Santoro with his 16month daughter 
            - crying a bit so daddy dancing with her in front of the pianist to 
            calm her down. Denis Golovanov arriving Saturday night being met by 
            Amit and taken upstairs. Not bad looking either is Denis! Todd Woodbridge's 
            new daughter Zara Rose 2 months old being bottle fed by mom as Todd 
            was checking out. Elder daughter about 2 saw my chips and wanted chips 
            - was then impatient waiting for them to come - had to be stopped 
            putting hot chips in her mouth and then when wasn't looking picked 
            up the plate to take to her daddy and dropped it - calamity!! Dad 
            Todd was oblivious to the whole carry on!<br>
            <br>
            Andy &amp; Mandy coming downstairs during the day and going off together 
            - enjoying Paris - why not it is a romantic city and they are very 
            happy in each others company. Then late at night see them walking 
            off outside to have something to eat. Bumped into them on Friday night 
            as I walked back - a very happy couple. Travelling in the lift as 
            I said with Escude - he is definitely a lot taller than I thought.<br>
            <br>
            Then back at the hotel after the match and Marat came back. Spoke 
            to him and he stopped and signed a ball for me off the court of his 
            semi final v Moya - one of the photographers gave it to me - signed 
            my Ace magazine the new article right across the front page - its 
            okay Marat I didn't want to read that again - and then took photos. 
            Vee was there first and I am trying to take the photo - now as we 
            well know Marat knows I have problems with cameras - looks at me - 
            and says take the cover off - you can't take a photo - said sorry 
            Marat you know me and cameras!! Then all had photos - me included 
            and amazed me - he put his arm round my waist straight away and I 
            had mine round him and then said now the one thing I have never done 
            - a kiss - he smiled and obliged!! <br>
            So the memories and the dreams and the joy all moulded into a fantastic 
            experience I will never forget. Definitely the icing on the cake on 
            Bercy's plate! <br>
