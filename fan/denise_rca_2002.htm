            <b>Indianapolis Saturday 10 Aug. 2002</b><br>
            <br>
            Well first day in Indy. Weather hot and the sun shining out of a clear 
            blue sky.<br>
            Got to the courts around 11pm and Marat was there practising hard 
            with Arnaud Clement. Spent about an hour and a half – hitting the 
            normal practice shots and then playing an on/off game – two others 
            were also working on the same court – and as usual Marat was not satisfied. 
            Once again the backhand slice volley is hitting the net each time. 
            Had some good groundstrokes from the back of the court but there is 
            still something not there. Marat is not relaxed with his game – he 
            is determined but it is not coming to anything. To those who think 
            Amit is not a proper coach – one - Marat talks to him – they sat and 
            discussed things and Marat would try again.And secondly I have never 
            seen Amit looking fitter – spent a lot of time also hitting up and 
            obviously trying to get a feel for the courts and so to advise Marat.<br>
            I think the point that said it all for me was the fact that at the 
            end Marat just walked off and didn’t stop for the fans that were there 
            behind the barrier looking for an autograph – something that Marat 
            does not normally do and says a lot about the fact that he is not 
            comfortable with himself and his game.<br>
            He has always done well at Indy and lets hope that it works for him 
            this week.<br>
            Saw Magnus Norman spend a lot of time practising as well as Xavier 
            Malisse , YK, Fabrice Santoro this afternoon. Spoke to Ramon Delgado 
            who should be Marat’s 2nd round opponent if he beats the Qualifier. 
            Ramon I met in Liverpool and spoke to him in the restaurant. After 
            Wimbledon he also had time off until Cinci where he lost to Ferrero 
            so only his 2nd tournament after Wimbly.<br>
            All I can say is Marat once to do well – just needs to get his mind 
            right. But he working towards it – looks fit and well apart from a 
            bit of arm stretching across his front which he normally does these 
            days to loosen up his back.<br>
            There is no laughter – no joking around – no play – just concentrated 
            effort. He wants to do well and we must be positive and believe in 
            him.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Indianapolis Monday 12 Aug. 2002</b><br>
            <br>
            Hi from Indy. Sorry didn’t post yesterday but not much to say with 
            regards to Marat.<br>
            It was very hot on Sunday and the same today. <br>
            Sunday Marat practised on Centre Court with Ivan Lubijcic and they 
            were having a good workout. Got a couple of good photos, which I will 
            have to send to Sergei later.<br>
            Anyhow Marat went to return a serve from IJ and the game was over. 
            Sat down in the shade with Anatoly – no sign of Amit – and looked 
            down at his stomach and seemed to be pinching a muscle. Anyhow came 
            out again and then after a couple of returns pushed at his side – 
            spoke to Anatoly in Russian and then walked up and said to IJ no good 
            and stopped. Signed for a couple of fans and then went off. This was 
            at 1pm. Tried to contact Amit later to find out what the problem was 
            and was told he wasn’t available – to phone later.<br>
            Well today saw Marat in the Racquets area and had a chat. Seems Amit 
            has had to fly home – some problem or other – and as Marat said – 
            I am okay on my own!! Said his back was okay but didn’t practice today 
            so guess he was giving it a rest. Was fine today – relaxed and we 
            picked up on a couple of discussions we had had in Liverpool.<br>
            Was disappointing for one young fan Sarah who was there for the day 
            with her tennis coach and a group of tennis players from their club 
            – she had so hoped to see Marat practice and get his autograph – well 
            guess who has the job of getting that autograph? No problem I am always 
            happy to help.<br>
            So basically a very hot uneventful day of tennis – some good matches 
            and some not so good.<br>
            Santoro breezed past Harel Levy so is still in the hunt and Stefan 
            Koubek knocked out Ramon Delgado so is Marat’s opponent. Koubek is 
            playing well but a rather hilarious point is that he should have automatically 
            been in the main draw as the 14th seed but he forgot to enter! He 
            entered a few days later but was too late. So decided to qualify and 
            made it through by the skin of his teeth against Alun Jones on Sunday 
            – took him 3 sets and nearly lost it I the final set tiebreak. Should 
            have done it in 2 but through away his service – bit of an up and 
            down player and wears his feelings on his sleeve – two of them together 
            – should be fun! At one point in the 2nd set as he lost his service 
            – he swore in German which the umpire did not understand but decided 
            he was swearing so gave him a warning! Koubek muttered to him in German 
            – you think you understood – you have no idea what I said and you 
            truly think I swore!!<br>
            <br>
            <b>Tuesday in Indy</b><br>
            <br>
            Well not much to report today especially not on Marat - didn't see 
            him at all. We had two huge storms which put all the matches behind 
            - spent a lot of time in Racquets reading my book &amp; talking to 
            people and Marat did not come to the courts at ll today as I think 
            a lot of the other players - guess they must have gone to an indoor 
            court to practice. Also he was not around at the hotel at about 11.20 
            this morning - saw Hewitt and entourage getting into a vehicle.<br>
            When tennis eventually got under away saw the most incredible doubles 
            match between Hewitt/Draper and Kratochvil/A.Martin. Went to 3 sets 
            and the second set and the start of the 3rd were magnificent tennis. 
            Hewitt did not have it all his own way and several times he and Draper 
            forgot to communicate and missed shots altogether going between them. 
            As Martin will play Hewitt tomorrow think he found out a lot of shots 
            that Hewitt doesn't like. Hewitt/Draper were eventual winners. Then 
            watched Haas v Norman - a great battle - Haas won in two but the tie 
            break was fantastic. There literally was only a couple of points in 
            it.<br>
            Tomorrow ave a full day of tennis. First up on Centre Court YK v Mario 
            Ancic then Marat v Koubek and then Hewitt v Martin. Night match is 
            Henman and then Hewitt/Draper in doubles. Going to be a long day.<br>
            So because have seen nothing of Marat can report nothing on if he 
            is okay or what - keeping a very low profile and without Amit have 
            no contact.<br>
            Will report tomorrow.<br>
            <br>
            <b>Marat 's withdrawal</b><br>
            <br>
            Hi everyone - well thanks dan not too gutted still here.<br>
            Re Marat - I admit I had a funny feeling something was not right as 
            he was nowhere around today and I said to christine (yes we have met 
            up) something doesn't feel right. Anyhow when it came to the match 
            they announced he had withdrawn. I checked with the hotel and he has 
            checked out and left Indy. Guess he will probably drive somewhere 
            and try and recover.<br>
            One thing - Marat does not withdraw from a tournament for any little 
            reason so he has to have been really ill. He will also be devastated 
            that he hasn't been able to compete as loves this tournament. So lets 
            just wish him well and hope he recovers quickly for the US OPen.<br>
            Cheers<br>
            Dendy <br>

            <b>Some info on the Marat camp!</b><br>
            <br>
            Hi everyone - just a quick update. I am leaving Indy tomorrow - decided 
            didn't want to stay. Will watch Hewitt v Rusedski tonight. Henman 
            is out - granted w/o to Verkerk today - reasons unknown at this stage.<br>
            Re Marat - he was bad ended up at the hospital emergency rooms on 
            Tuesday but true to form wanted to see if any chance could play. <br>
            Seems Amit was also ill and is still here with Marat. Had contact 
            and they are on their way towards NY and Amit says Marat will be ok.<br>
            Hope that helps.<br>
            Bye for now<br>
            Dendy <br>
