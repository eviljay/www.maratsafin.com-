            <b>Our stories of THE DAY!</b><br>
            <br>
            I met Marat Safin! One of the most coolest and hottest guy on this 
            planet. lol! I went together with my friend Susie to see him playing 
            in Ahoy, Rotterdam, Holland .<br>
            On Sunday I called my friend Susanne to wish her luck, because she 
            was going to see Safin that Monday. Susanne is a huge Marat fan, and 
            I was so happy for her that she was going to see him in real. <br>
            When I reached her on the phone she told me that unfortunately her 
            friend called her up and told her that she wasn't going with her to 
            the game. And so she also couldn't go.<br>
            She was so sad, that I said that I wanted to go with her to see Marat.<br>
            I'm not a huge tennis fanatic, the last time that I played tennis 
            or even saw it was when I was 6, so you can imagine that I don't have 
            a huge tennis spirit, or something like that.<br>
            The only thing was that I couldn't go on Monday so I said that I could 
            go with her on Wednesday.<br>
            Luckily Marat won the game on Monday and so he played on Wednesday. 
            Susanne and I arrived at 3:15 pm in the Ahoy, and we had to wait for 
            like 15 minutes to get tickets, so when we finally sat down we already 
            missed the first set.<br>
            We waited until the game was over, unfortunately Marat lost the game 
            and of course we were a bit sad about that, but we realised that he 
            couldn't win every time and so we headed to the player entrance to 
            meet Marat. Over there we met a girl (Fatima) who was also waiting 
            for Marat! <br>
            We waited and waited and waited, and every time that someone opened 
            the door we almost had a heart attack. Even I, although I wasnв't 
            a fan of Marat. After 15 minutes suddenly Ferrero came outside, and 
            Susanne and the girl nearly died when they saw him. I really didn't 
            knew who he was (okay, I'm blonde-&gt; stupid, I know), but I saw 
            on the faces of Susanne and Fatima that it was a famous tennis player. 
            <br>
            So that's why I asked him for his signature in English, he gave us 
            his signature and Fatima went with him on a photo (Susanne and I are 
            right now regretting that we didn't went with Ferrero on a photo).<br>
            Ferrero was in a bad mood, maybe because he also lost his match. And 
            he kept talking to us in Spanish, although I can speak a little Spanish, 
            I couldn't understand him. Ferrero left pretty quick. <br>
            And Marat still had to come. We looked every time when somebody opened 
            the door, and suddenly we saw him!!!!! <br>
            He was sitting on a couch, and somehow he noticed us. He kept on looking. 
            <br>
            And we screamed his name. After 5 minutes he came outside. Susanne 
            saw him coming so she warned us!! <br>
            When Marat was outside I gave him our present (a black/white necklace) 
            and I asked him if he could sign something for me and he did. <br>
            Susanne gave him her &quot;SUPER SAFIN&quot; poster and asked him 
            if he could sign that for her, he was so surprised about the poster, 
            he laughed when he saw it, and showed it to his friends. When he wanted 
            to sign it he dropped the pen, and he said: I'm nervous. Wow, he was 
            nervous??? <br>
            I guess we were all pretty nervous. Lol. <br>
            He signed it and after that Susanne went with him on a photo. After 
            that Fatima went with him on the photo and after that I did.<br>
            He was so nice and so hot! He really took the time for us. He wasn't 
            in a bad mood, although he lost the game. <br>
            When we were finished he gave the pen back to me and he left. <br>
            I would never forget that day and how nice he was, he was very gently, 
            and so big (lol, well maybe I'm just too little), I just was stunned 
            when I saw him!!! .<br>
            I truly can say that he has yet another fan, and that is me!!! <br>
            Love Always, Jacoline <br>
            <br>
            <b>Here is my story about that great day.</b><br>
            <br>
            On Wednesday February 20 me (Susie) and Yakko were going to the Rotterdam 
            tennis tournament to see my favourite player, Marat Safin, play. We 
            arrived at about 3;15 in the afternoon.<br>
            We had to wait in line for our tickets. As we sat down in the tennis 
            hall we realised we had already missed the first set (dammit!)<br>
            But we did get to see the other two sets.<br>
            Unfortunately Marat had lost the match (dammit again!).<br>
            When the match was over Jacoline and I rushed outside to wait for 
            Marat at the playersentrance/exit. <br>
            We met a girl there who was also waiting for Marat. We talked a bit 
            about Marat, his match and just tennis in general. We waited by the 
            door so Marat couldnt escape without being jumped on by us :P LOL. 
            <br>
            Everytime the door opened we almost died. Cats may have nine lives, 
            we have a thousand and I must say that I have lost a lot of lives 
            that day :) <br>
            Ok,never mind me :P<br>
            Suddenly the door opened and Jc Fererro came out. He is a great tennisplayer 
            and cute! :)<br>
            I completely froze and was very glad Jacoline asked him for an autograph 
            for me (thanx Jac!)<br>
            After a while Jacoline saw Marat in the room behind the door,sitting 
            on a couch. I called him when the door opened and he looked at me. 
            Then Jacoline and I called him again and after five minutes he came 
            outside. I was sooooo + nervous!!<br>
            He signed my Super Safin sign and he liked my sign so much he showed 
            it to all his friends!! <br>
            I was so happy he liked it :)<br>
            I also took a picture with him. He put his arm around me (can we say 
            oh my god!lol).<br>
            Right before that he had dropped the pen and he said he was nervous. 
            How cute :)<br>
            It was such a great day!! I will never ever forget Marat's charm! 
            <br>
            He was soo nice, kind andbeautiful!<br>
            I am an even bigger fan now then I was before (if that is possible).<br>
            Hope to see Marat again next year!! <br>
            Love Susanne <br>
            <br>
            Tsaar Marat!!! <br>
