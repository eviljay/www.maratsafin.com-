            <b>Paris, Tuesday 30 October 2001</b><br>
            Hi everyone from Paris. Well didn’t do a report last night as we finished 
            so late and we were so tired just didn’t have the energy. What has 
            been happening? Monday must be known as the day of tiebreaks! There 
            seemed to be so many of them and it made the matches so long! The 
            last match of Philipoussis/Malut started at 11.10pm – well only stayed 
            for three games and then went back to the hotel. <br>
            <br>
            Our hotel is right next to POBP so just walk out the door and up the 
            stairs and we are there. It is an older hotel but in the same group 
            as the hotel next door and the one the main players are staying in 
            which is about ten minutes away. At our hotel all the camera crew 
            and officials e.g. linesmen etc are staying so quite a laugh. Quite 
            a few South Africans amongst the cameramen so I have been having a 
            good laugh with them. In fact the one guy recognized me from being 
            on the same flight out of Stuttgart so we went from there! Getting 
            too well known that is the problem!! <br>
            <br>
            Well apart from the incidentals – back to the tennis. Saw some good 
            matches and will give you my thoughts on them in a minute. Went to 
            see yesterday morning if Marat had arrived but by the time we left 
            at 12.30pm he still hadn’t come in from St. Petersburg. Had seen Schalken 
            arrive from Stockholm and Henman had already arrived from Basel. Ilaria 
            had fun – had her photo taken with Haas and Roddick and Ivanesevic 
            and Ferrero.<br>
            I am a great photographer these days! <br>
            <br>
            Was cold standing around but great to see all the players. Watched 
            Lapenti defeat Dupuis despite vociferous support from the crowd for 
            the Frenchman. Lapenti fought back well and that has been proved today 
            with his beating Hewitt. Didn’t see that match but Chris did and she 
            said that it appeared that Hewitt had a stomach bug or something and 
            did not feel well. Then saw Arazi take out Kiefer – Kiefer just could 
            not cope with Arazi’s spin – think Santoro against Arazi will be quite 
            something – see who can soft touch and outspin the other!! Then Rusedski 
            had no answer to Malisse who had one of his better days – when he 
            plays well he is very good and when he doesn’t he is horrid! Wonder 
            what tomorrow will bring?<br>
            <br>
            Then of course had to watch Pioline/Kucera to see who Marat would 
            be playing. Of course the crowd was all for Pioline and we had one 
            lone supporter close to us who was shouting for Kucera. Ilaria and 
            I were divided as to who we wanted to win – thought it would be better 
            with Kucera as his game is similar to Marat’s and he would avoid the 
            rather “over the top” support of the French crowd for Pioline. Kucera 
            was not very complimentary about the crowd in his talk after the match 
            – said they should remember the difference between football and tennis!! 
            <br>
            <br>
            As I said before the matches had been so long that we didn’t wait 
            to see the end of the last match. This morning started off early and 
            went to the players hotel to wait for Marat. It was cold with a biting 
            wind and we stood and waited!! Saw the other players come out – there 
            were a few others waiting – one young girl was over the moon when 
            Mark Philipoussis signed her poster and kissed her on the cheek – 
            tears galore!! As usual Juan Carlos Ferrero is very good at signing 
            and letting everyone take pictures of him and with him – very obliging 
            and always smiling.<br>
            <br>
            Then suddenly Marat was coming out – said Ilaria he is here and we 
            rushed over and I took a photo of Ilaria with Marat and then she took 
            the photo of me with Marat – pic attached. I am here I promise. Didn’t 
            get any other pics of him as too many people around and Ilaria had 
            my camera and she was over the moon!!<br>
            <br>
            Then just after Marat went off to practice – Mats arrived from the 
            airport so he IS here. Later went and had a coffee inside the hotel 
            and Mats was sitting talking to someone right close by. Watched the 
            players going by and enjoyed the atmosphere!! Then went off to watch 
            the tennis. I watched doubles first have got on talking terms with 
            the South African Ellis Ferreira so went to watch him and Rick Leach 
            win their game.<br>
            <br>
            And then to Court 2 to watch the end of Schalken beating Luzzi – never 
            mind Ilaria! Then we watched Ljubicic take out Moya – he is playing 
            very well indeed. Saw Ferrero watching the play for a bit and Ivanesevic 
            was watching as well. He had been beaten earlier – don’t think he 
            was really worried now he has qualified for Sydney - think he is saving 
            his shoulder! Then Ferrero came on to play Portas. <br>
            <br>
            Court 1 is really great you are so close to the players in fact Ilaria 
            was right in front behind the players and I was behind her and Ferrero 
            kept walking right up to the edge and toweling himself and hanging 
            the towel over the side of the stand – so close you could touch him! 
            Why can’t Marat play on a court like that! Imagine!! Then back to 
            Centre Court to watch Enqvist/Escude and Keurten/Uhlirach – Keurten 
            seems to have got his confidence back – made an easy match of it. 
            See there was another upset in that Corretja lost to C. Rochus! <br>
            <br>
            Earlier I had met up with Chris and we watched the doubles together 
            and then she joined Ilaria &amp; I to watch the last two matches together 
            and then we came back to the hotel and had a drink . She had spoken 
            to Blandine earlier and hopefully we will meet up tomorrow as well 
            as Slestat will be there tomorrow too so should be fun. We have a 
            very long day – Marat is last on Centre Court and he hates playing 
            so late!! Hope Mats can keep him focused. We are all deciding what 
            should happen to the other threats to Marat so he better do his part 
            while we will put the “bad” thoughts on his other opposition to Sydney!<br>
            <br>
            It is fun being here – POBP is a bit disorganized but is situated 
            in a good area with lots of small restaurants and bars around so makes 
            for a festive time. Now nearly midnight and I must finish this and 
            send off to Sergei. Will try and get some more photos tomorrow of 
            Marat and send off to you all. Goodnight and we will have sweet dreams 
            of our favourite man. I am sure Ilaria will!!<br>

            <b>Paris, Wednesday 31 October 2001</b><br>
            Actually it is now the 1st November – it is 1am and I am trying to 
            get this<br>
            written.<br>
            <br>
            What a night – what a day!!<br>
            First of all spent a long time waiting for Marat today and eventually 
            saw him at 13.45 - more photos – and he was very relaxed and happy 
            and said he would play well tonight!!<br>
            Then off to the tennis. Spent most of the day on the Court No.1 – 
            as I said last night – the players are so close – you can touch them. 
            Wouldn’t it be wonderful if Marat played there!! Their programming 
            is crazy – today we had Federer against Novak – and Novak won!! Yeah!!! 
            Then Costa against Canas – brilliant rallies and Court 1 makes it 
            all seem so alive – the atmosphere is incredible. Then after that 
            had the two Swedes Enqvist and Johansson – another base line rally 
            game brilliant tennis and Johansson came out the winner!! So far it 
            was fantastic. <br>
            <br>
            Then everyone was trying to get into the court to watch Philipoussis 
            against Kafelnikov – not enough room while upstairs on Centre Court 
            – Boutter knocked out Henman and Santoro and Arazi played a tame match 
            and then Grosjean against Hrbaty – because they are French they were 
            playing to a fairly empty stadium – and people were queuing up to 
            get into Court 1!! No sense in that lot. We left when Kafelnikov broke 
            Philipoussis in the 2nd set and went upstairs. Ilaria needed to eat 
            and I went to find Chris. She had seats right in the front so went 
            to sit with her.<br>
            <br>
            Then Blandine joined us and we put up Ilaria’s sign “Good Luck Marat” 
            and watched. It is a wonder I do not get a heart attack I get so nervous 
            and he kept us right on the edge. The confidence was not totally there 
            - not enough first serves though was getting better towards the end 
            and the humour – well that was hilarious. The umpire had caused great 
            consternation between Philipoussis and Kafelnikov on Court 1 – overruling 
            on the far side and they kept asking him was he sure he could see 
            that and then Ilaria and I couldn’t believe it – he was umpiring Marat’s 
            match. Well at one point in the 3rd set Marat asked him if he was 
            sure that serve was okay?? You are sure?? No I am not being cheeky 
            I am just asking to make sure you are happy!! Very tongue in cheek!! 
            <br>
            <br>
            Then in the first set where he was getting cross and the crowd made 
            a noise so Marat got down on his knees and bowed to the court to say 
            sorry. Also said “Sorry” loudly another time. Lots of humour – points 
            of brilliance and other times total mess up – just hope that this 
            was the start like Indy against Sa and then he got better and better! 
            He had better because I don’t think my nerves can stand it!! Mats 
            was there as well as Amit and Gerrard.<br>
            <br>
            As we did last night came back to the hotel to have a drink and then 
            look at tomorrows schedule.<br>
            Well cannot believe it – our wish has come true – we have Marat on 
            Court No. 1<br>
            after 4.30 pm – he will be so close and we will be there to watch 
            him. Guess you will not have it on TV as Keurten is playing Schalken 
            at the same time on Centre Court. Today Haas won – maybe he gets knocked 
            out tomorrow ? – Henman out, Kafelnikov through – Roddick out – a 
            few upsets.<br>
            <br>
            “Well he has started and tomorrow it is Vinciguerra – Marat you can 
            do it – we believe in you but please try and do it a bit easier don’t 
            think our nerves can stand it!!”<br>

            Paris, Friday 02 November 2001</b> <br>
            <br>
            Well the bubble has burst and the tennis year is over for Marat. A 
            year I think he should put down to experience and look forward to 
            2002. Last night he pressed the self destruct button and really did 
            that. At one point Marat said “ I never play such BAD tennis before”. 
            He knew it – we knew it – nothing would go right. Maybe it all started 
            at the hotel yesterday at 12 when he came out – Mats said he was too 
            tired to sign – too early and Marat looked tired. I jokingly asked 
            him if he was too tired to sign and he said no I thought you want 
            photo so then he signed but not as relaxed as the day before. <br>
            <br>
            Court 1 was packed – we got there at 1pm and sat through Johansson/Lapenti 
            – Lapenti had no answer to Johansson and then I was the lone voice 
            shouting for my compatriots Wayne Black/Kevin Ullyett of Zimbabwe 
            as they played Max Mirnyi/Sandon Stolle and they won in 3 sets. I 
            was very excited. Actually a lot of the players looked jaded yesterday 
            – like they really had been out enjoying the Paris nightlife and didn’t 
            really want to be playing tennis. Keurten out and also Ferrero – just 
            had no answer to Arazi and looked really “sluggish” in the third set. 
            From the start of the game Marat just didn’t look confident – was 
            rushing things – broke Vinciguerra but then promptly lost his serve 
            – broke his racquet in the first set – hit it hard first looked at 
            it and then decided he better make a good job of it so well and truly 
            smashed it. And the warning followed. Didn’t even shout or anything 
            – just looked very resigned – was not even running properly – in fact 
            the main problem was he was playing Vinciguerra’s game and waiting 
            for him to make the mistakes. Instead Marat made them – lots of them! 
            Didn’t vary his game at all except towards the end of the second set 
            and then started looking better but it was too late – Vinciguerra 
            had the break and he was feeling confident and despite a couple of 
            close calls Marat could not break him back and that was that! A very 
            upset Marat – threw it all away. One of the cameramen (from South 
            Africa) staying in the hotel said when he came into the bar for a 
            drink last night – your man lost – I said yes he did a self destruction 
            exercise. He said they had Tommy Haas’ coach Red doing the commentary 
            on the match and he was very excited that Marat lost as that confirmed 
            Tommy would probably go to Sydney. So the year is over. <br>
            <br>
            As Marat had said previously - forget this year – 2002 he will be 
            better and fit and well. He now has a good break to relax – sort out 
            his affairs and get himself into shape for Australia. Don’t know if 
            he is playing Hopman Cup this year or going to Adelaide – hopefully 
            we will be able to check out details later. As to Mats – I don’t know 
            – there was an interview in the daily programme which was at 20.00 
            hours on Wednesday before Marat’s first match – and Mats said basically 
            he likes working with Marat – he is very talented but whether they 
            will continue or not he doesn’t know. My opinion – Marat needs to 
            sort out a proper team around him that can give him the support he 
            needs – next year he is 22 – another year older and wiser – and time 
            to get his life together. Unfortunately the learning curve is a harsh 
            one. We all have the bad times and then the good times come again. 
            This was a bad time for Marat – I am sure he has learnt a few lessons 
            in the realistic world this year and now he needs to apply those lessons 
            learnt to the New Year 2002. <br>
            <br>
            He has the talent and he has shown he can think – now he must combine 
            the two to become the lethal talent we know he is. Rest, recuperate, 
            relax – the three R’s Marat and then next year starts with a bang. 
            You will be No. 1 again – but build to it slowly next year – not all 
            in a rush! Well I hope to visit a few more tournaments next year. 
            I have met a lot of the fellow fans and it has been great. I hope 
            to meet more next year. We all come from different parts of the world 
            but we have one thing in common – MARAT SAFIN. <br>
            Long may he play and long may he reign! <br>
            <b><br>
            <br>
            Paris Friday 2 November 2001 </b><br>
            <br>
            So Friday started – woke tired and a little bit down – always find 
            that once the andrenalin stops pumping – feel very deflated. Slept 
            a bit later and then decided once had had breakfast and sent off Thursday 
            report, that would go along to the Sofitel and see if Marat was still 
            there as he would be leaving today. Got to the hotel about 11.30 and 
            met with Aurelie and Cindy and the rest of the crowd who were normally 
            in front of the hotel. <br>
            <br>
            Dedicated band we are – waiting in the cold – laughing and chatting 
            just to catch a glimpse of Marat! Had arranged that as the tennis 
            was only starting at 2pm – we would meet with Chris at 1pm and go 
            for lunch before going on to watch tennis.<br>
            <br>
            Ilaria and I had some coffee and then went outside to join the others. 
            Aurelie said “Look Marat’s car” and there was this gorgeous dark blue 
            Mercedes Coupe – very sleek and low slung with Monte Carlo licence 
            plates – definitely suits the image and the man – I am definitely 
            in love with that car – but then I am a sucker for beautiful sports 
            cars!! Helps as well that the driver is so sexy as well!! Not sure 
            of the model – did look at is but it is the top of the range Mercedes 
            Coupe.<br>
            <br>
            Well Ilaria and I hung around and he had not appeared and it was now 
            1.05pm so had to go to meet Chris at our hotel. Walked fast and then 
            when got to the hotel – Chris says “We must go back” so fast walk 
            back again to the Sofitel and introductions all round. Chris was very 
            pleased to be there so she would actually see Marat with all his fans.<br>
            <br>
            About 1.50pm I saw through the glass front of the hotel Amit heading 
            towards the desk with Marat following. “He’s coming everyone!!” Well 
            there were a whole lot of fans inside all mobbing him and then out 
            he came. Looked a bit sleepy – always does when it is early – and 
            2pm is early for Marat! Before that the bags had come out and been 
            loaded in the car – 2 large Dunlop bags, 1 suitcase, large BOSS carry 
            all plus 2 others – good thing that the Merc has a large boot.<br>
            <br>
            Marat was carrying a small bag and Amit a racquet which while everyone 
            was crowding round Marat I spoke to Amit and got given the racquet 
            because it had a broken string! In the meantime Chris was taking photos 
            and Ilaria had managed to kiss Marat so a lot was happening. <br>
            <br>
            Then Marat managed to get to the car and open the door and saying 
            “I must go now I have a long way to drive” and another one tries to 
            have a photo and kiss him – oh the popularity!! <br>
            <br>
            While this was all happening Amit was at the passenger side and says 
            doesn’t anybody want to take my picture with my car?? So I laughed 
            and said but I have taken your picture before and he smiled and I 
            took another one. Pays to keep the manager happy!! <br>
            <br>
            Then Marat climbed into the car, said goodbye and closed the door 
            and drove off to Monte Carlo!! Everyone was talking at once and wanted 
            to touch the racquet! Plain no name nothing on the strings for everyone’s 
            info – just a small yellow sticker which said Safin – the stringers 
            reference obviously!! <br>
            <br>
            So we said goodbye to our friends and then went in to have lunch in 
            the Sofitel. Had a lovely lunch and saw Max Mirnyi and father – when 
            we left Max was sleeping in a chair in the lobby while dad sorted 
            out the bill! <br>
            <br>
            The rest of the day saw the tennis until late as had to watch the 
            doubles Zim playing SA/US and ZIM lost in a tight 3 setter. Nearly 
            1am again before got to bed – lots of late nights!! But before that 
            had a real downer. Before went to the tennis – went past our hotel 
            and took the racquet into the room and put it into the wardrobe. <br>
            <br>
            Well to cut a long story short – when we came back in the early hours 
            – no racquet in the wardrobe and a new Masters Series T Shirt that 
            Ilaria had bought was also gone! Went down and reported it to the 
            desk but guess that is it. Not sure how it happened – they will investigate 
            it today but that is that! Now we can understand how Marat lost his 
            passport/chain etc - don’t understand how anyone even knew. <br>
            So for a brief while I had Marat’s racquet in my hand!! <br>
            <br>
            Today it is the semi finals – intriguing prospect – Kafelnikov against 
            Vinciguerra who played very well indeed against Schalken and then 
            the crunch match for the Masters Cup – Haas against Grosjean. It will 
            be interesting to see how Haas will cope with the French crowd – they 
            get very carried away. <br>
            <br>
            So Marat goes to Monte Carlo to plan his season and decide what to 
            do about his coach and where to go on holiday. He is not going to 
            Hopman Cup and will play Auckland instead before Aus Open. That is 
            definite from his manager.<br>
            <br>
            So for once we have news from”the horses mouth” so to speak Glad we 
            went to the hotel – that car was very worth seeing apart from the 
            owner/driver of course! <br>
