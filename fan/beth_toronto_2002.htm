            <br>
            Hi everyone! First off, I'd just like to apologize for the lateness 
            of this tournament report,
            but I had to make sure I had everything compiled and fixed up before 
            I posted it up for you guys
            to read. Well, I just recently attended my first tournament this summer 
            and it was absolutely
            FABULOUS! For a Marat fan, such as myself, it was all I hoped it would 
            be and more!<br>
            <br>
            I went to TMS Canada, in Toronto... and it was just amazing. For those 
            who have been, as you know, it's a pretty small tournie, but I sorta 
            like that. It's a very inviting atmosphere, with plenty of time for 
            player interaction and great courts where you can see everything close 
            up. <br>
            For my first tournie, it was so worth it. Sorry if I get my days mixed 
            up, I should have taken a page out of Dendy's book, and posted each 
            day so nothing would be forgotten, but I guess I didn't think about 
            that when I was caught up in the moment. However, I was there from 
            Monday to Thursday, so it all fits in somewhere in that time frame!<br>
            <br>
            <b>Day 1. Monday</b><br>
            <br>
            I got there around 2:30 or so, and I was so excited. I had a friend 
            who was working at a booth selling mags, so it was nice to know someone 
            there. I walked around a bit and familiarized myself with the courts 
            and all. I can't remember exactly everyone who was playing that day, 
            but I do remember that Marat was not playing. I had to go to summer 
            school up until the day before, so unfortunately I didn't get there 
            in time for qualies. My friend had a media pass though, and she told 
            me that Marat had been practicing on the open courts during qualies. 
            He apparently looked in great form which I was really happy to hear! 
            However, much to my dismay, once the tournament started, one would 
            be hard pressed to find Marat practicing on anything but the backstage 
            practice courts where no one is allowed to go. Lleyton played the 
            night match, but on that day, but I had to leave early (family dinner) 
            so I could only be there till 6. I watched Rusedski vs. Martin which 
            was quite an interesting match as well. I also watched the Kratochvil 
            vs. Srichaphan match which was also quite enjoyable. I loved the fact 
            that the courts (except centre court) were so small... you could get 
            right up close to the players. It was so surreal to see them there 
            that close to me. Anyways, I also watched the beginning of the Norman 
            v. Dent match before I had to leave. My first day was really nice 
            because I got to see what was going on, the surroundings etc. I also 
            saw the outside practice courts which had some great players on it 
            as well. No Safin news that day, but I did hear from my friend that 
            he was going to be renting out a sheet of ice with Magnus and some 
            other players, for a game on Friday night. You know us Canucks and 
            hockey.. eh? <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Day 2. Tuesday </b><br>
            <br>
            So on the second day, I was pumped. Now, I've never heard of it before, 
            but at TMS Canada, the security had to check your bags as you went 
            in. It took a lot of time, but again, it was worth it. As soon as 
            I got in, i dropped off my stuff at my friend's booth, and scouted 
            the courts (there are 5 playing courts in all - including centre court, 
            and there are 3 behind the scenes practice courts not open to the 
            public, and three that are open). Anyways, before matches start @11, 
            the players practice on all of the courts, so i saw some lovely practices. 
            Especially from Max Mirnyi among many others. I checked all the courts 
            open, but sadly our Marat was nowhere to be seen. My friend told me 
            later on that he was practicing on the closed courts (as she has a 
            media pass, she can see the schedule for practices on closed courts) 
            On the second day, Marat did play, however, it was on centre court, 
            so it's hard to get as close as a smaller court, and I had a hard 
            time seeing that. It was very hot, but for a Marat fan, it was worth 
            it. He played Chela, and I was very nervous, biting my nails and all, 
            for as far as I remember, Chela had beaten him on an earlier occasion 
            - and quite easily at that. However, Marat seemed to be okay, and 
            for the most part, his tennis was pretty consistent. He hit some pretty 
            great winners, and as always, his groundstrokes were brilliant. I 
            agree that he is even more brilliant and skillful in person. Needless 
            to say, he won, and signed plenty of autographs after - Marat, always 
            the fan pleaser. I was even more excited though, because I knew that 
            he first round jitters over, he'd come back again to play tomorrow. 
            There was a Blake autograph session. I can't wait to watch him on 
            the tour. He's a great guy. <br>
            <br>
            Also, on the second day, I watched the Ferrero v. Enqvist match. It 
            was a thrilling and really well played match by both players. I was 
            on the edge of my seat so much, that I was probably going to fall 
            off soon. I met some great gals there, and we sat together, which 
            was really fun. The sisters, Allison, Christina and Ellen were JC 
            fans and Marat fans as well, which was really neat. I had no idea 
            who I wanted to win the match, but after a tense moment when JC took 
            a time out for his feet to be wrapped by the med on hand, and he prevailed. 
            Anyways, the three sets were absolutely brilliant. I felt really bad 
            for Thomas though, because he played brilliantly... just that Ferrero 
            had amazing shots as well. Mostly all of the points could have gone 
            either way. Anyways, Ferrero signed my program that I had bought, 
            and that was pretty neat. Another plus was that the court they played 
            on was court one, a smaller court, and much more intimate than the 
            bigger centre court. Anyways, It was a double whammy, because right 
            after that match, the Roddick v. Hrbaty match was on. It was great, 
            because it was also on the smaller court. I felt sad for Hrbaty because 
            the Roddick fans were dominatingly loud, but I wanted Andy to do well 
            too! So, again I was torn, but Hrbaty just got dominated, and it was 
            pretty quick that Andy won. I have never seen SO MANY fans mob a player 
            before, but Andy wins the prize! There were floods of screaming girl 
            fans (I was reminded of the similarity to Marat hysteria) but they 
            were crazy. In many ways, Roddick reminds me of Marat...he is amazing 
            with his groundstrokes, and his serves are some of the most powerful 
            I have seen. Anyways, I got Roddick's auto and almost his towel....to 
            make a long story short, a man (i know... a MAN!?!?!?) took it away 
            from me, and was pretty mean about it, but hey, that's life eh?! <br>
            <br>
            Note : Safin and Kafel were supposed to play their doubs match today, 
            but it got moved to tomorrow - they were saying because Safin couldn't 
            play today.. anyways, I'm not sure of the whole story.. all I'm sure 
            of is that Safin is going to be playing 2 matches tomorrow.. I hope 
            he's not too tired!<br>
            <br>
            <b>Day 3. Wednesday</b><br>
            <br>
            Before I get to the Safin match (I know I will have lots to say about 
            it.. probably drone on forever) let's talk about the other matches 
            I saw. Keep in mind that this is in no particular order, because I 
            watched a lot of matches, but mostly kept switching between them, 
            because they were all on at the same times :( which was sad for me, 
            because I often had to leave at good parts as I also wanted to see 
            other ppl play as well! <br>
            <br>
            BEFORE matches:<br>
            I got there around pretty early, and again a crowd was there, but 
            I didn't mind. The humidity was unbelievable for summers in Canada, 
            even that early in the day, and I think I was burnt from the day before, 
            but anyhow, I went to scout courts once again. Again, my friend delivered 
            the news that Safin was on closed courts but I checked the open ones 
            just incase. I actually saw Santoro practicing. He is a really fun 
            guy to watch - his practices are just so different from the normal 
            routine of other guys. He really works on those slices and placement 
            of all his shots, which left me in absolute awe. After he was done, 
            I got an autograph, and as he was signing, I said, &quot;Fabrice, 
            can I ask you a question?!&quot; and he said (in his lovely Parisian 
            accent) &quot;of course you can&quot;. So I said, &quot;what is your 
            secret to beating Marat all this time? <br>
            You are certainly great at it!&quot; He just chuckled and said, &quot;Oh, 
            you are a Safin fan, are you?&quot; <br>
            I was wondering.... how did he guess?!?!<br>
            <br>
            MATCHES : <br>
            <br>
            HENMAN/BLAKE -<br>
            Poor Blake, he just got beaten by Tim.. and just the day before, he 
            had an autograph session when he said that he was going to try his 
            best because he had nothing to lose against Time...<br>
            Anyways, I couldn't stay for long, I had to run around like crazy 
            to other<br>
            matches....Additionally, Blake v. Henman was centre court, so it wasn't 
            as close up.<br>
            <br>
            KAFEL/EL AYNAOUI -<br>
            Great match, i loved it!.. However, poor Younes was beaten.... though 
            it was a struggle for Kafel. After, they both gave autographs though, 
            and I hope Younes wasn't too sad about it.. he played a great match 
            out there for sure! Kafel looked a little worse for the wear after, 
            but he came back strong the next day... oops.. getting ahead of myself 
            here...<br>
            <br>
            MANTILLA/DENT -<br>
            This was a good match as well. Taylor had quite a fight put up against 
            him, but he won it in straights. He was so gracious to sign afterwards 
            as well, and he was really nice. I love Dent too, he is a great player, 
            and I am growing to be a great fan of the volleying that he does....<br>
            he's a little Rafter-ish.... It's nice to see that. <br>
            <br>
            EL AYNAOUI/ROBREDO vs. BHUPATHI/MIRNYI -<br>
            This was pretty good, though I couldn't stay long, but I did see that 
            Robredo and Younes did well. However Mirnyi and Bhupathi won. They 
            are a wicked team! How much do I love doubles?! <br>
            <br>
            GAMBILl/LLODRA vs. PRINOSIL/RIKL -<br>
            awww. Poor Jan was getting so mad with all the calls, and he was really 
            venting out there. <br>
            Though Gambill/Llodra won the second in a tiebreak, they ended up 
            losing. A sadder part of my day for sure. <br>
            <br>
            BRYAN/BRYAN vs. KOENIG/KRATZMANN -<br>
            Mmm.. Very good match, with lots of exciting stuff to see. Though 
            the first set was lost in the tiebreak, the Bryans came back to win 
            it... and I was so happy for them. They are a great doubles team too!<br>
            <br>
            Okay.. and on to the stuff I have lots to say on....<br>
            <br>
            PAVEL vs. SAFIN -<br>
            MMMM.. i was soooo nervous, Pavel is another guy that sometimes Safin 
            has problems with, and so I was willing Safin to win one way or another. 
            Luckily for me, it was in straights, but I did have to sacrifice a 
            lot of the other matches to stay on centre court to watch this match. 
            A bit of a nail biter, but not yet a heart-attack maker.... but so 
            close! Also it was really hot out, since it was in the afternoon, 
            but it was worth it to see Marat win again. The shots were looking 
            fantastic. I saw him come up to net, which was nice as well, because 
            he seems to be doing that more often now! I'm loving that. However, 
            the groundstrokes also were consistently getting better and better, 
            and the winners were coming, so I was really happy about that as well. 
            Also again I was diligently waiting outside after the match with friends 
            in tow. Marat took a long time, so he probably signed for a lot of 
            people inside the stadium before coming outside to sign some more. 
            He is such a great guy to his fans!<br>
            <br>
            KAFEL/SAFIN vs. FEDERER/FERREIRA -<br>
            This was one of the funniest matches I've ever watched! I think there 
            were more people who turned out to watch this match than a lot of 
            the other evening matches. A lot of girls in particular! With all 
            the big names, who wouldn't be there?!? I got there early and snagged 
            a spot right behind Kafel and Safin's benches. It was great because 
            I got to hear their banter between games. I also met another cool 
            Safin fan. Her cousin was coaching a player (who hasn't made it big 
            yet) and so she was checking out matches (I never did get her name) 
            but she was a really cool European gal and we had funtimes hanging 
            out watching Safin. Again Safin being extremely nice to his fans, 
            we were talking about how hot and humid it was outside during the 
            mid-game break. We like to think that Safin heard our convo, because 
            he reached behind him and turned the electric fan to us instead of 
            him. Maybe the fan was annoying him, but we were just happy to have 
            any breeze we could get! Anyways, Safin and Kafel were doing okay 
            in the first set. They were keeping up and having some amazing rallies 
            with F&amp;F. It was great, until F&amp;F broke K&amp;S serve.. and 
            then won the set. Unfortunately for K&amp;S, things only went downhill 
            from there....in the second set, it was almost as if K&amp;S had somewhat 
            given up. My theory is that they had both played matches in the day, 
            and had matches for the next day as well in singles. <br>
            So, I guess they were probably tired and thinking about when it was 
            time to go to bed and rest! <br>
            Anyways, they lost the second set as well, but they were laughing 
            (almost) all the way to the end. Marat did get a little mad, and throw 
            the racquet a couple times,... he thoroughly smashed it once when 
            he got really, really mad. He also said a lot of things to himself.. 
            although I didn't understand it all, because it was half English half 
            Russian. One of the funniest things is when he paused right after 
            a shot that went into the net, threw up his hands, and told the umpire 
            that he [the umpire] should give him [Marat] a warning for the way 
            he [Marat] was playing. Everyone laughed at that - even Marat and 
            Yevgeny cracked a smile. Also, there was a guy in the stands who kept 
            yelling out things in Russian to Marat and Kafel. They laughed at 
            what he had to say, so I suppose if was funny. I did hear the English 
            words, &quot;Try harder, try harder...&quot; <br>
            Anyways, at match point, they really just gave up, and didn't really 
            even make an effort to return - They were already too far behind. 
            However, even though F&amp;F won, more people went to Kafel and Safin 
            for signage of paraphenalia (sp?). I tossed Safin the Canada bear 
            that I had brought for him, and he put it in his bag. Attached to 
            the bear I wrote a note for good luck, and assured him that us fans 
            in Canada would love to have him back, his fans are rooting for him, 
            and so on. With so many fans, I'm sure he gets it all the time, but 
            anyways, he gave me his towel (he told me that he couldn't give me 
            the racquet that he had smashed - Dendy you lucky ducky... I think 
            he probably gets reimbursed for it after?! So he put it back in his 
            bag) which was all good to me. Marat did come up to the net alot in 
            the doubles, but it needs work. I think his baseline game is still 
            the best. I also got a couple of great pictures from that match!...I'll 
            send them to Sergei to post them as soon as I get them all scanned. 
            Kafel and Safin weren't too too mad, so everyone was pretty much relaxed 
            and everyone signed lots afterwards.<br>
            <br>
            Anyways, I didn't quite get around to the Roddick match, as I was 
            at Safin's,.. but when I got back to my aunt's house.. I saw it on 
            the tele.. and apparently there were some nasty words exchanged. I 
            don't know all of what happened, but I guess Andy was in a really 
            bad mood, because he normally is so generous, but my sister friends 
            tell me, that night, he hardly signed at all, if any! <br>
            <br>
            <b>Day 4. Thursday</b><br>
            <br>
            So Day 4 was my last day, so I was determined to make the best of 
            it. I saw the Henman v Nalbandian match, and was quite shocked that 
            Tim let all those match points go away like that. <br>
            I bet he was pretty mad. He certainly looked it when he came off. 
            However, I do credit Nalbandian for being a great fighter. He hit 
            some amazing drop shots and such, the entire match, and he definitely 
            put it up there. Good Job to both.<br>
            <br>
            Also, Kafel got beaten by Canas. Although I didn't watch the majority 
            of that match, I did see the end of it, and I was quite surprised 
            that Canas came away with that one. I thought for sure Kafel would 
            win after the doubles loss, but hey, that's how deep the men's field 
            is nowadays. I did feel bad for Kafel though. I bet it was the doubles 
            at night the day before that tired him out! :(<br>
            <br>
            I wanted to see the Bryans play doubles, but I didn't get around to 
            it. I believe that I was moving between their match and either the 
            Santoro v Martin or Grosjean v Stepanek match OR Safin v Rios match. 
            In any case, they won, and my media friend got towels from them, so 
            that was good. <br>
            <br>
            I watched the Dent vs. Novak match as well. It was very cool to see 
            Dent again, but he got beaten by Novak. I actually didn't know much 
            about Novak before, but he is a great player and moves around very 
            well. He dealt well with Dent's volleying style, and he definitely 
            got Dent into some troubles.. eventually Novak won. However, Taylor 
            was great and still signed a bit before he left the court. He was 
            a very composed player. I got a towel from him which was pretty cool 
            as well. <br>
            <br>
            The Mirnyi/Bhupathi vs. Ferreira/Tarango was pretty good as well. 
            I hardly got around to seeing that one a lot either because I was 
            at the Safin match. It was nice to have all my faves still in, but 
            it was so hard because I had to always move between the matches. Tried 
            to cheer everyone on simultaneously, but tried to go where help was 
            needed. Anyways, Mirnyi looked like he had things under control between 
            him and Bhupathi... Safin on the other hand looked like he needed 
            some serious help, with losing the first set and all.<br>
            <br>
            So, I went to watch the rest of the Safin match. Now this was a heart-attack 
            match. Good thing he won the second set 6-3. I was so pumped.. but 
            then Rios broke him in the third set, and I was getting worried again. 
            Finally, when it got to Rios 4 games.. I was basically going to have 
            a heart attack right there. I had to get out of the stadium to compose 
            and then go back. (VERY nervous fan here) Anyways, he finally got 
            it back together to 5-4 for Rios. I was so scared. <br>
            Rios took a &quot;medical&quot; time out.. and I was just in shock. 
            Safin was going to be serving for the tiebreak opportunity... so I 
            was just on the edge of my seat and getting ready to cheer Marat on. 
            I was loud... pretty sure the people around me were deaf after! Rios 
            had his whole cheering section there as well though.. they were chanting 
            the &quot;Chile Cheer&quot;... if you know .. it goes &quot;Chi-LE, 
            Chi-Le, Chile, Chile, Chile!&quot; It's a little hard to verbalize 
            on paper. I think it threw Marat off a bit. Usually his cheering section 
            is loudest. Anyways, finally, tiebreak came, and I was again very 
            nervous. The points were close at first, but finally,<br>
            FINALLY.... Marat won it... I was just jumping up and down and clapping 
            , though it seemed like I was the only one! I was thinking, &quot;What 
            is your problem guys? SAFIN WON!&quot; Anyhow... he came out, and 
            signed. When he came out it was absolute pandemonium. I asked for 
            a wristband or towel or shirt or whatever, but he said he had given 
            away everything back on the court or whatnot. Again, Safin being dedicated 
            to his fans had given it all out on the court again. I was just excited 
            to see that he won. I wonder if he recognized that I was the one who 
            gave him the bear the day before?! Well, it was really good, at least 
            he won, even if it was that close. <br>
            WHEW!<br>
            <br>
            Just a warning now about the Roddick match : if you don't like Roddick 
            or fan stories you can skip this section. <br>
            <br>
            And the Roddick match. I felt really bad for Koubek, again because 
            Andy's section was huge and Koubek had like 3 ppl there! Anyways, 
            Andy made quick work of Koubek, and was pretty much on top of his 
            game for the whole match. A couple times he was disgusted with himself 
            for &quot;rushing the serve&quot; (his words) and such silly mistakes, 
            but he did win it. And I was also smushed in the front row of fans 
            trying to get autographs. I ended up getting his towel, but another 
            guy had it as well. Since we didn't want to give it up to the other 
            person, we went to guest services and they cut the towel up for us.... 
            Now I have half a towel! (ok... you can insert laugh here) the thing 
            is that I didn't want to give it up or let go, because the last time 
            that happened was also at a Roddick match, and the other guy got it 
            when I really had it first... So anyways, it was a nice compromise. 
            Besides, If I hadn't taken the towel, another girl would have gotten 
            'my' half.. and she already had EVERYONE else's towels.. really no 
            joke. She had Federer, Mirnyi, Dent, Agassi (from another tourney) 
            wristbands from players... EVERYTHING. So I would rather keep the 
            towel.. wouldn't you? Anyways, she also said she got Safin's towel 
            from his doubles match, but as far as I know, Safin gave out only 
            one towel at his doubs match, and that was to me, because I gave him 
            the bear. Some fans are quite.. er... interesting. Anyways, no worries... 
            it was a great match, and very entertaining as the &quot;Netheads&quot; 
            were there. The &quot;Netheads&quot; are a bunch of fans cheering 
            on Americans and Canadians, and they get tix for wearing basketball 
            net type hats on their heads and cheering as loud as they possibly 
            can. They were sitting on the stands opposite me and my friends, (Jesse 
            and Lisa) and a bunch of other Roddick Fans. At breaks they would 
            yell &quot;ANDY!&quot; and we would yell back &quot;RODDICK!&quot; 
            and so on... I think Koubek got sick of it. Andy won, and everyone 
            (for the most part) was happy!<br>
            <br>
            The Sampras-Haas match at night looked very interesting, but I wasn't 
            there to see it because I was at the Roddick match, which was also 
            on a smaller court, so it looked more appealing to me. If I so much 
            as moved my butt, someone would have been along to claim my seat, 
            so I couldn't even run between matches. <br>
            <br>
            Anyways, my days at the tournament are done, but I am definitely going 
            to go back. It is such a great tourney to go to. Very small and very 
            very extra cool. Also, there was this great girl Carol who was volunteering, 
            so she had extra tix that she couldn't use because she was working, 
            so she gave them to me. I love Safin tennis fans. Especially cuz she 
            was a Safin fan too, so they were extra special tix. <br>
            <br>
            I guess Safin lost to Canas, but I hope he comes back for the US Open. 
            I was sad about the RCA tournie, but I know he's going to come back 
            and regain the form, win more tournies. I know he can. It's just a 
            matter of the right time and right place, in the right situation. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Well, now I am back at home, being a Canuck, there is only one tournie 
            a year I can really go to, the rest are really far away, but I am 
            looking forward to next year or the next tourney I get to attend. 
            I hope to go to Cincy or something in New York/Massachusetts/Washington 
            areas. <br>
            I hear their tournies are amazing there as well. I can't wait! 'Till 
            next time. Luv ya all,<br>
            Peace <br>
            Bye<br>
