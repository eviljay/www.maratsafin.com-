            <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Three 
            days of ABN AMRO WTT<br>
            <br>
            February 2002<br>
            <br>
            This year I planned to go three days to the 30th anniversary of the 
            ABN AMRO world tennis tournament. Last year was my first time that 
            I went and I loved it so I said to myself: next year you are going 
            again.<br>
            <br>
            Well the year went by very fast and at the end of 2002 I noticed that 
            my favourite player Marat Safin was seeded 1 for the WTT. I was very 
            happy about that, because I was going to see him again. The days went 
            by very fast and before I knew I turned 18 in January and Marat turned 
            23 ;-).<br>
            <br>
            After that I was very busy with school so I forgot the dates and then 
            I noticed that it was already Sunday February 16th. I watched the 
            order of plays for Monday on the website but I noticed that Marat 
            wouldn’t play that day. So I thought he would play on Tuesday. Well 
            Monday I checked fot Tuesday but no Marat wasn’t in the order of play. 
            So he would play Wednesday.<br>
            <br>
            Wednesday was a regular schoolday so I decided to go to school first, 
            and then skip a few classes to see Marat play that midday. I stood 
            up in the early morning (5:45 am) and went to school. My school is 
            like 2 hours and 15 minutes away from my hometown (I’m studying journalism 
            in Ede) and because of that I also live there, but my hometown is 
            closer to Rotterdam than Ede so I decided to sleep that week at home.<br>
            <br>
            Well my plan worked out very fine. I arrived in Rotterdam at 2:30 
            pm and bought tickets for the match. I also met up with Fatima (a 
            girl I met last year) and we went to our places in the stadium. Susanne 
            ( a friend of mine, and also a Marat fan) also came, but she didn’t 
            knew that the match went that quick, because when she arrived Marat 
            just won. Although it were some nerve breaking moments in the first 
            set, he won. He played very well. Although he couldn’t find his game 
            in the first games. <br>
            <br>
            After 4-3 for Malisse he finally found his game and started to play 
            great tennis. Sometimes he made some stupid mistakes, which he also 
            regretted, but nobody is perfect. They played a very fast game, and 
            he smashed the balls very hard, so did Malisse. So you could barely 
            see where the ball was….lol…..Marat had his wrist still in a bandage.<br>
            <br>
            After Marat had won the match we hurried to the player entrance to 
            see him there. Well we waited for more than 1,5 hours in the freezing 
            cold to see him. Because of that we also met 2 other tennisplayers: 
            Albert Costa and Dominik Hrbaty. Albert was very nice, he gave us 
            an autograph and he complained about the weather…lol….cause it was 
            freezing cold. Meanwhile he was also phoning somebody, and also posing 
            for us…he is a very funny guy!<br>
            <br>
            Dominik didn’t say a word, but he did signed some things for us. Then 
            when I was talking to one of my friends I noticed that someone passed 
            me, so I looked, and it was Yevgeni Kafelnikov. Kafelnikov is one 
            of my favourite tennis players besides Marat and so I shouted his 
            name….but he didn’t react…I was quite disappointed about that. But 
            maybe I have more luck next year…hope he will not retire.<br>
            <br>
            Well after a long time Marat came. He was very nice and he signed 
            stuff for us. And took pictures with us. I asked him about his wrist 
            and he told me that it his wrist was getting better. If it is not 
            getting better he would probably will have surgery on it, that’s what 
            I read today in the program book of the ABN AMRO. Marat seemed okay, 
            and he had a tan. And of course he did everything we asked. He is 
            so gentle. If there will be ever an award for most gentle person, 
            they have to give it to Marat!<br>
            <br>
            We also bought some presents for Marat and gave it to him, and he 
            said loud and clear and surprised: THANK YOU! We weren’t the only 
            one who wanted to speak to Marat, and while he was in a hurry I didn’t 
            had the chance to say more to him. Only I wished him luck for tomorrow. 
            There was also a Russian couple who wanted to take pictures with Marat, 
            and I also wanted to do that so it was a very odd situation cause, 
            Marat was standing next to me and every time the couple jumped in 
            front of me. Marat had to laugh about that. <br>
            <br>
            I didn’t had the chance to go to the game of Marat against Yevgeni, 
            because it was on a very late time, I did went to tennis on Thursday 
            and I saw Ferrero, Bjorkman, Santoro Federer, Sluiter, and Nieminem 
            play. I enjoyed myself a lot that day, especially when Raemon Sluiter 
            played. He is Dutch, so the whole stadium was overloaded, and everybody 
            was really into the match. <br>
            <br>
            I also took some great pictures. I still regret that I didn’t went 
            to the match of Marat against Yevgeni, but I had to go with public 
            transportation and because I live 50 minutes away from Rotterdam I 
            couldn’t make it to the last bus. And because I also was going to 
            the semi-finals on Saturday with my dad, he didn’t wanted to drive 
            me to the match. <br>
            <br>
            Thursday was fun. Although it was very sad that Marat lost that day, 
            but on the other hand, maybe his wrist wouldn’t took it any longer 
            if he had to play more. He still has to be careful with his wrist. 
            <br>
            <br>
            For Saturday I had VIP-tickets. So we had a box. Which was kind of 
            cool. Cause you are so close to the tennis court. I saw the match 
            of Federer against Mirnyi. Great match, I never expected that Mirnyi 
            would win. In the daily bulletin I read and saw that Ferrero had a 
            very bad injury on Friday. He can’t play for 6 weeks. He injured his 
            right ankle. I’m so sorry for him, cause he played so well. <br>
            Also Escude had to give up because of an injury he also had in Marseille. 
            After the match of Federer against Mirnyi, we went to the VIP-lounge. 
            It was very cool, bus they have all these cafe’s.<br>
            They have an Australian Open cafe, a US Open, a Wimbledon, and a Roland 
            Garros café. Also A Grand Slam café, and we sat down in that one. 
            And not to forget they also had an ABN AMRO lounge. It was so cool 
            to had the chance to walk there. <br>
            After we did that I also saw the double match of Federer/Mirnyi against 
            Damm/Suk. <br>
            <br>
            Those three days were great! And of course I’m going again next year! 
            Hopefully I will meet or see Marat Safin again. Cause he is still 
            my favourite tennis player.<br>
            <br>
            Love Always, Jacoline <br>
