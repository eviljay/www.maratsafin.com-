            <b>RCA Indianapolis Tournament 13 - 19 August 2001 </b><br>
            <br>
            Practice Sessions Saturday 11 and Sunday 12 August 2001<br>
            <br>
            Indy is a small compact tournament not unlike LA. The practice courts 
            are over on one side and there is the main stadium plus a grandstand 
            court plus 6 other courts. Slightly larger than LA but the same easy 
            going atmosphere. As a Box Seat holder I have access to Racquets the 
            players lounge and dining room. During the weekend they have all used 
            Tommys and so you sit down to eat with all the tennis players around 
            you.<br>
            <br>
            Marat came out to practice at 12noon on Saturday. Mats was with him 
            plus another manager this time - not one I have seen before. Mats 
            had his two small sons with him and they were busy hitting around 
            a tennis ball with two normal size racquets - two future Wilanders 
            in the making?<br>
            <br>
            Marat practiced with James Blake the young American player and he 
            was not very happy with himself - still no confidence in his strokes 
            or his play. Well he practiced for an hour and then I went into the 
            cool of Tommys to have something to eat and drink and cool off - really 
            hot and humid outside. Well Marat and Mats arrived and sat two tables 
            away from me and Marat ate pizza - a favourite with most of the tennis 
            players. I had Zabaleta and Sa and a couple of others at my table 
            - Zabaleta can eat - two salads and pizza!<br>
            <br>
            Then at 3pm Marat came out for another practice with James Blake - 
            this time were playing an actual game - well Marat was getting passed 
            by Blake and he got really mad - skied two balls out of the grounds 
            - shouted at himself in Russian and was very pissed off all round. 
            He kept looking at Mats and throwing his hands in the air. Anyhow 
            when he came out I tried to have a word with him - walked with him 
            after first asking if I could talk to him if he wasn't too pissed 
            off and wasn't going to throw a tennis ball at me - I got &quot;Sorry!!&quot; 
            and a smile. Anyhow I tried to tell him that all his fans from maratsafin.com 
            were thinking about him and believed in him and supported him still 
            no matter what but don't know if he totally understood because when 
            I said maratsafin.com said his managers dealt with that. So I tried 
            my best everyone.<br>
            <br>
            Today came out to practice with Goran and Marat was a lot better. 
            Of course helped that Goran couldn't get anything right and Marat 
            was getting his first serves in and the passing shots were going right. 
            Don't know if it was truly indicative of his play, as Goran was not 
            trying to do anything but it must have made Marat feel a bit better. 
            Mats seemed very subdued today and spent most of the time talking 
            to James Blake's coach who was on the next court so don't know if 
            Marat and Mats have &quot;had words&quot; or what. There was not as 
            much showing or talking today from Mats and they didn't come into 
            lunch. Kafelnikov was practicing before Marat and they chatted as 
            Kafelnikov went off. Actually Marat needs to do more on his physical 
            fitness - Kafelnikov went on a jog after practice - Max Myrni jogs 
            and limbers up before and after practice. Today Marat didn't come 
            in for lunch and by the time I left at 4.15pm had not practiced again. 
            Today I had Tomas Enqvist at my table with his coach nattering in 
            Swedish. Goran came in with girlfriend and others plus Zabaleta et 
            al and Todd Martin and Thomas Johansson - quite a collection. Lot 
            of the young Americans here including Taylor Dent, Robbie Ginepri, 
            Mardy Fish who were all at LA but there is no Andy Roddick and no 
            Pete Sampras or Agassi. Henman, Kuerten,Hewitt and Rafter should all 
            arrive tomorrow so should be an interesting tournament. Very much 
            all the Government Centre - Convention Centre - State Buildings, RCA 
            Dome and Victory Field as well as the Military Park with memorial 
            to the all the American War Dead. The players are all at the Westin 
            Hotel about 5 minutes from me - a block away - looks onto the Capitol 
            Park which is very pretty - walked down there the other day and watched 
            all the players coming out to the Courtesy Cars.<br>
            I walk straight up the road through the Military Park alongside the 
            Canal Walk and I am at the Tennis Centre - about ten minutes walk 
            so very close.<br>

            Well I have seen 4 great matches. Tuesday Marat started out very hesitantly. 
            Was broken early and lost the first set very quickly. Did not look 
            confident - his shots were tentative and his serve was not crisp. 
            I must admit I had a few horrible thoughts that he was going to go 
            out early. But then I remembered the Marat I had seen practice on 
            the Saturday, Sunday and Monday and how he had steadily improved and 
            been so dedicated. Also I had spoken to him that afternoon and said 
            &quot;Play well tonight&quot; and he said &quot;I will&quot; so I 
            believed him. So I sat in my seat and said &quot;fight Marat fight!&quot; 
            He did - he came out and fought - a lot of the shots were still not 
            quite there but the fight was. He started playing a thinking game 
            - varying his play - the serves were one minute fast the next slowed 
            right down and it threw Sa. It was a slog but in the end Marat was 
            the winner. No great excitement at the end in fact he looked tired 
            towards the end of the third set - but there was a lot more running 
            and getting to the balls - a very good sign of the old Marat coming 
            back. For once he didn't raise his arms to the crowd at the end and 
            the interview was short - he was not completely happy with himself 
            - knew he had to do better.<br>
            Wednesday Marat was out at 3pm practicing - practiced with someone 
            I don't know - Russian speaking maybe a friend - very hard hitting 
            and they spent ages doing ground strokes and volleying. Then a whole 
            bunch of players went by heading to the field behind the practice 
            courts with a soccer ball in hand - next thing Marat and friend headed 
            off the court through the side to play his second love - soccer!! 
            Amazing how many of them spend hours doing soccer exercises with a 
            tennis ball - bouncing on alternate feet and rolling down the back 
            of their necks - good for co-ordination. By now I was quite used to 
            going into Racquets and seeing Marat come through and eat his pasta 
            and drink a Pepsi.<br>
            Thursday his match was fairly early as Hewitt was blown out pretty 
            quickly. The weather was cloudy and lots of gusty wind and I though 
            &quot;well this is a test Marat - bad conditions, and Robredo&quot;. 
            We had a rain delay in Hewitts match and I was sitting in Racquets 
            having had something to eat as knew I wouldn't eat until after Marat's 
            match - I never do - get too nervous! I had just finished when I heard 
            someone say &quot;Hey Marat and the voice coming from up the stairs 
            - &quot;I have to go practice&quot; - late again - well at that moment 
            rain delay was announced. Don't know how much practice Marat got because 
            he came back in and took some pasta off to the players lounge. Well 
            he came on court - all week he has worn the grey with black - kept 
            consistent as all the other Adidas players were wearing the white 
            with the light grey and Marat had obviously decided to be different 
            -good for him! Robredo was also in greys so they were similar but 
            different sponsors. Again started off tentatively and got broken early 
            - thought oh dear but no Marat was not finished - he fought back - 
            broke Robredo and took the tie break. The second set was as he said 
            the best tennis he has played in a long time - he flowed and dominated 
            and thought - varying his play - he had Robredo totally frustrated 
            and he had control - running down shots - passing - cross courts - 
            they were flowing off his racquet - Marat was back! And all the while 
            despite his usual hands when he missed a shot - a lot of control - 
            only one code violation in all his matches for ball abuse - no racquet 
            abuse and only one shouting at himself.<br>
            Then Friday - Enqvist early match - he practiced at 10.40 and finished 
            at 11.10 before making everyone wait for him to come on court - that 
            is normal. The resident columnist on the draw sheet for RCA Tornament 
            - Sandra Harwitt said Enqvist to take the match - I knew she was wrong 
            - I had seen Enqvist play - he was still up and down and nothing to 
            match Marat. Well Marat took charge from the start - it went with 
            serve and then took the tie break - the second set he dominated totally 
            - Enqvist was totally frustrated - lots of shouts from him and almost 
            smashing his racquet. But he had no answer to the sheer power of the 
            Marat Safin tennis. Went down to where the players come down and saw 
            Marat and said well done it gets better and better and got that wonderful 
            smile - it makes my day!<br>

            Saturday.<br>
            Well knew I had to be their early as had seen the order of play the 
            night before after leaving at 10.30pm. Got there just after 10pm and 
            Marat was on court practicing - not many people around so as he walked 
            off I was the only one standing there and he looked across and I said 
            &quot;Play Well&quot;. It was quite a match - lots of support for 
            Rafter - really played him up and the crowd loved it. Marat was quiet 
            and refined - smiling and so easy going - two really nice guys and 
            good tennis players on the court playing each other for the first 
            time. Marat started slowly - found it hard to cope with Rafters spin 
            but to start with his first serve did okay. All was well until he 
            had his customary lapse and lost his serve. Funny no histrionics when 
            he lost just carried on with the next set. Started spinning in his 
            serves - mostly seconds as first had deserted him and using a lot 
            of spin on his returns - had decided to fight fire with fire. Again 
            the thinking Marat - then those beautiful down the line passing shots 
            started coming - left Rafter flat footed several times and just a 
            little nod from Rafter acknowledging the shot as he walked back to 
            the baseline. Rafter had his good volleys but at times Marat even 
            out volleyed Rafter. He was running down the shots and really making 
            some good tennis plays. The result was he broke Rafter - the first 
            to do so all week - and won the second set. Third set - Marat should 
            have broken Rafter a couple of times - one to take the third set but 
            Rafter clawed his way back. The tiebreaker - Marat's lottery - going 
            so well lost one of his serves-broke it back and it looked like it 
            was going to be a long tiebreak and then that sitter to slam over 
            the net and it went into the net - didn't make sense - it was such 
            an anti climax - we were all stunned - think even Rafter was stunned 
            - Marat was still calm. One thing did make us all laugh - Marat was 
            not getting the lucky bounces - the ball would hit the net and fall 
            back on the wrong side or bounce out - so after one such unlucky bounce 
            that meant he didn't break Rafter's serve - he walked up to the net 
            and looked as if he was about to hit the racquet hard on the net instead 
            he stood and looked at it and touched it gently - such control!! Then 
            the time he ran down a drop volley got it over for a winner and just 
            avoided running into the net - right in front of the umpire - looked 
            up to see if okay and won the point. Pure control! To me the match 
            was played in a great spirit by two great players both appreciating 
            the brilliance of the other - one of those unfortunate games that 
            it was not nice that someone had to lose - in this case it was Marat. 
            The point with the ball was so funny - Rafter was tossed a ball by 
            the ball girl and we could even see it from the seats - it was brown 
            - one that had got lost in the flowers - he hit it to Marat and Marat 
            looked at him - said so? With a raise of the eyebrows and promptly 
            hit it high out of the court - the umpire hadn't caught the exchanges 
            and must have thought Marat was doing his usual as queried it and 
            Marat said &quot;He told me to get rid of it!!&quot;<br>
            Then I waited at the back and Rafter came out and signed and Marat 
            hadn't come out - in the end they said he would be another 45minutes 
            -still more interviews. He is so popular with the press - Bud Collins 
            of CBS even interviewed him after his practice before the Rafter match 
            - there he was sitting with the towel over him talking on how he was 
            going to play Rafter - ever the talker our Marat! Well eventually 
            when Marat came down there were only a few kids around for balls to 
            be signed and I stood at the end holding out my programme so nicely 
            - well he just smiled at me as if to say - again? but find it is the 
            easiest way of getting him to stop. He signed the fullest signature 
            I have ever got and I said Bad luck wished him well for the US Open 
            and said see you next in Paris and he said smiled and said &quot;Yeah&quot; 
            and I said &quot;Yeah I will ' so he nodded and said okay and went 
            on his way. <br>
            The funny thing is the look as I stand there either for a photo or 
            to get him to sign - just a quizzical smile and a raised eyebrow - 
            guess he probably thinks - again - what is she up to??<br>
            I am glad I went to Indy - it really boosted me to see Marat play 
            like that and to make me really believe he has a chance to win at 
            the US Open.<br>
            That semi final as it turned out was better than the other semi or 
            the final so it was maybe like watching the final. <br>
            Thank you Marat I am glad I made the trip. Here's to seeing you in 
            Paris and hopefully by then you will be back to your brilliant self 
            of last year.<br>
