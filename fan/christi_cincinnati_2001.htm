            Tournament 09 - 15 August 2001 </b><br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Thursday, August 9<br>
            <br>
            I get there at around 10 and head straight for the practice courts 
            because I know that's where some good action is. I leave and come 
            back at 4 to see no one special practicing. Then I turn my head and 
            see Mats Wilander, so I get excited because I know Marat will be behind 
            him! And he is! I jump up and down because he's still in Cincinnati 
            after his 1st round loss. I watch him talk to some practice partner 
            (I have no idea who). <br>
            <br>
            He is very expressive, talks loud, and uses his hands A LOT. Gets 
            to practicing with this guy. <br>
            Marat is SO powerful, the most powerful guy I've ever seen, although 
            Taylor Dent is pretty close. He hits it perfectly nearly every time 
            and is slicing every single backhand; he doesn't hit a two-hander 
            with topspin the entire time. He hardly ever misses, but when he does 
            one time, he yells a few sentences loudly in Russian. I almost laugh 
            because he sounds so funny. Mats has his 2 cute blond kids on the 
            court, and they bounce balls with their racquets. Mats just stands 
            back there, doesn't say much. The guys who are watching joke, &quot;Safin 
            is a ladies man&quot; because of the girls who are watching him. It 
            starts raining hard. We all scramble to get his autograph, including 
            these girls with t-shirts that say, &quot;We miss you Marat Safin.&quot; 
            He smiles and chuckles at their shirts and is signing and taking pictures 
            quickly to get out of the rain. I ask some guy to take a picture of 
            me with Marat, and ask, &quot;Marat, can you take a picture with me?&quot; 
            He is taking a picture with someone else, so he says in his thick 
            accent, &quot;Yes, get in the picture.&quot; It's pouring rain and 
            none of us is prepared for the picture. So I vow to get another one 
            tomorrow. I say, &quot;Thank you very much&quot; and he says, &quot;Sure, 
            no problem.&quot; I say, &quot;Good Luck in Indianapolis,&quot; and 
            I'm pretty sure he says, &quot;Thank you much,&quot; which is very 
            funny in his accent! 
            <p>Friday, August 10<br>
              <br>
              My whole family gets to the ATP tennis center at 10:30, right when 
              the matches start, so I miss out on most early practice sessions. 
              My brother and I go to the practice courts at 3 p.m. in hopes of 
              seeing someone. Sure enough, there is a crowd in front of the last 
              court, so I figure it's someone big. It's Marat, which makes me 
              so happy! We watch his long practice, and he hits with Mats, who 
              is still really good. Marat only gets mad once, where he takes a 
              ball and hits it about 100 feet away from the court. I don't think 
              anyone volunteers to get it. It doesn't matter because they get 
              free tennis balls anyway. He says, &quot;My forehand is so bad, 
              the<br>
              worst ever.&quot; It's great, but his slice backhand makes no mistakes 
              at all. He comes in to volley a lot and is getting good up there. 
              He serves really hard. Mats proposes a serve-and-volley drill, but 
              Marat replies, &quot;I'm bad!&quot;<br>
              <br>
              They discuss how far Indianapolis is from Cincinnati, and Marat 
              says it's 116 miles, so Mats says it should take about 3 hours or 
              less. I almost touch him through the fence, but that's a serious 
              invasion of privacy.<br>
              Marat's trainer is Russian, I think, so he tells Mats that Marat 
              is &quot;???&quot; (I don't know what the word was, fill in if you 
              know the word!), which means tired in Russian. Marat finally comes 
              out. All of these kids ask for his autograph. I say, &quot;Mr. Safin&quot; 
              for him to sign the other side of our Russian nesting doll, which 
              has already been signed by Yevgeny Kafelnikov. I thought he would 
              laugh or something, but he's not so cheerful today. I ask if he 
              can take a picture with me, if it's not too much trouble, and he 
              says sure. I don't think he remembers me from yesterday. He is shirtless 
              (quite skinny now, not as buff as was a few years ago) and holding 
              his bag and puts his arm on my back. I put my arm around him but 
              end up hitting his bag, so I don't get to feel his sweaty back. 
              My brother takes the picture, and I'm so excited! Marat takes pictures 
              with everyone and signs for all. He's very nice to his fans. We 
              follow him all through the grounds, right after I ask Mr. Wilander 
              for his autograph. It's very easy to get his autograph because all 
              of the kids who want Marat's autograph don't know who Mats Wilander 
              is. Marat walks near the concession stands, shirtless and towering 
              over everyone, while everyone stares and whispers. It's hard to 
              miss a 6'4&quot; shirtless Russian carrying a tennis bag with a 
              trainer and a coach! The little kids run to get his autograph, and 
              he signs for all of them. He ends up on the golf course goofing 
              around with Mats and his trainer. I wish I could have followed him 
              more, but that's stalking. It was so fun today!<br>
              <br>
              Saturday, August 11<br>
              <br>
              Nearly all of the players, except today's semifinalists, have cleared 
              out of Cincinnati. I am sure Marat has left for the RCA Championships 
              in Indianapolis, which is 3 hours away, because he and Mats were 
              discussing their trip yesterday. That's ok, I had a great time watching 
              Marat Thursday and Friday and hope that he will do well at Indianapolis!<br>
