                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> 
                    What does playing somebody like Boris and beating him, even 
                    though he's no longer at the peak he was, what does that mean 
                    to you?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Today was a nice match because he's -- 
                    I think it's my opinion, he's not ready to -- he's not playing 
                    good, I don't think. He wasn't ready today. But he's still 
                    Boris Becker. He was No. 1 in the world. It doesn't matter 
                    how he's playing now, he was No. 1 in the world. It's everything.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> How did you regard him eight or ten years ago when 
                    you were a little boy starting to play? Was he a hero?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, I like him, watching in TV or somewhere. 
                    It's nice, play against him. I mean, it's very important to 
                    me that I can say to my kids that I was playing against Boris 
                    Becker. It's nice. Sorry for the people that loves him a lot.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> How much a better player do you think you are now 
                    than you were in the French Open last year? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think more experience. Now I know what 
                    I have to do. Most important moments of the match I can think. 
                    I can do a lot more, I can play better now because I feel 
                    better, with more confidence, I know everybody from the Tour. 
                    I have more experience, just this. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> Although you're preparing for this tournament and 
                    the hopes to win a championship, what do you think about the 
                    area itself in South Florida? Are you enjoying any recreational 
                    activities at all? Do you like it here? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, I like it. But I'm 19 years old, 
                    so (laughter).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> No marriage in your plans there?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No. I just playing my tournament. I bought 
                    a computer three days ago, so I'm playing with computer. I 
                    can go anywhere.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> Are you on the Internet all the time?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, but I like this place. Miami is 
                    very nice. I like it very much because I was here like seven 
                    times playing Orange Bowl, a lot of tournaments. So I like 
                    it. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> You know this was Boris' last match in the United 
                    States. Do you have any feelings about beating him so badly, 
                    especially in the second set?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Very badly, yeah (laughter).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> That's tennis, right?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Really it's not very nice, but I really 
                    sorry about that. I was doing my job. I was playing because 
                    I can't lose the concentration. If not, Boris can make turn 
                    around the match. I had to play all the points, so that's 
                    why the score in the second set was a little bit not so good. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> What do you sense was the difference? 5-5, double-faulted 
                    three times. Seemed like the lights went out after that.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think it was the key there. He make 
                    just three double-faults. If it's going 6-All, I don't know 
                    what can happen in the tiebreak. Maybe in the second set he 
                    play with more confidence, because he doesn't play a lot of 
                    tournaments, so he's losing confidence, confidence is going. 
                    I still don't know what can happen the second set if he win 
                    the first one. He can play unbelievable tennis. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q: </b>He did, you say? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No, he can play unbelievable tennis. If 
                    he win the first set, feeling better, maybe 7-6, 6-0, but 
                    for him, 7-5, 6-0.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> Did you watch him? When Boris won Wimbledon the 
                    first time, you were four or five years old. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I was in a kids garden. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q: </b>Were you interested in watching tennis when you 
                    were young?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I didn't see him too much on the TVs. 
                    It was a little bit difficult for us, for Russia, to see Boris. 
                    Sometimes in the big tournaments like Wimbledon and Roland 
                    Garros, of course I was watching him. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> That must give you a lot of confidence because you 
                    played so excellent, with the Davis Cup now against Germany.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Really today was a little bit nervous 
                    because still it's Boris Becker. I was playing good today.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q: </b>When did you first see him in real life, not on 
                    television? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Last year, Stuttgart. Boris, Boris (laughter).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> Did you feel you had to show him some respect early 
                    in the match? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Is difficult to respect him. Of course, 
                    you respect Boris. In the match, you have to think how to 
                    beat him. It's not the respect -- it's not the same respect.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q: </b>Apprehensive of his reputation?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I don't know. It's different. I was thinking 
                    about to win this match. Doesn't matter who is standing in 
                    there, Boris or Pete Sampras, who else. Out of the court, 
                    of course I will respect him.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> Do you follow the history of tennis? Do you know 
                    how many Grand Slams he's won, how many Wimbledons he's won? 
                    <b><br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> Really, exactly, I don't know.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    Q: </b>You mention you're 19 years old. How does it feel having 
                    a job like this, you're on top of your game, other people 
                    are going to work with a briefcase and suit and tie? You're 
                    19, having a great time playing tennis. How do you enjoy your 
                    position at such a young age?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> It's true, I'm 19 years old. I don't know 
                    what can happen next year. Maybe I'm going back to play satellites. 
                    19 years old is a good age. I'm 26 in the world. I don't know 
                    what can happen. It's not for sure, a hundred percent, that 
                    I'll be a great player. Maybe, maybe not. Maybe I'm going 
                    back to satellites. Maybe I retire in one year. Maybe something 
                    can happen tomorrow. Nobody knows. I don't have a good contract 
                    with, I don't know, a good magazine like somebody here. I 
                    have to be worry about this. This is my job.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    Q:</b> Where are you going to start your clay court tournaments 
                    after Davis Cup? <br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> Estoril, and everything, Barcelona, Monte-Carlo. 
                    I have to play because I'm young. Why not? I will try this 
                    year.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> Are you going to play anything on grass between 
                    France and Wimbledon?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah. I'll play Queen's and Rosmalen. Not 
                    too many chances.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    Q:</b> In Spanish you said that you felt sorry because of 
                    the crowd, that you defeated Boris. But you didn't show any 
                    mercy when you were 5-Love. When Boris was in his prime time, 
                    he was the same. Did you feel a little bit, "I am winning 
                    this set in such a way against Boris"? <br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> It's not nice, but if I give him one game 
                    --. <b><br>

                    Q:</b> -- He can come back? <br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah. Why not? It's too dangerous. Sorry 
                    about this. It's too dangerous for me. <br>
                    <b><br>
                    Q:</b> You thought that? <br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: </b>Yeah, of course. I know it's not nice, but 
                    this is tennis. I have to think about me.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    Q:</b> When Boris was 19, he wouldn't have given you a game.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: </b>For sure. This is for sure, a hundred percent.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> Are there public radio stations or TV stations where 
                    you're from? Do you listen to public radio or television where 
                    you're from?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> What do you mean?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    Q:</b> Like National Public Radio or public television?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Talking about me? <br>
                    <b><br>
                    Q:</b> Yes.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> For the moment, no. I hope you will talk 
                    about me.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q: </b>We certainly will. Tomorrow you play Mark Philippoussis. 
                    Lost to him in Indian Wells. How are you going to approach 
                    this match? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Last week he was teaching me how to play 
                    tennis. This week I don't know. I hope I'll play better. I 
                    will try to do all my best. I think he won Indian Wells last 
                    week. He's playing good, big serve. He's been playing good 
                    from the baseline and unbelievable volley. It will be really 
                    tough. I have to be clever in important moments of the match. 
                    It will be just two or three points. It will be all the match. 
                    So I have to be with more confidence and be clear. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> Are there other sports you have a passion for as 
                    much as tennis? <br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> Soccer. I like hockey, but it's too dangerous, 
                    I think, my teeth (laughter).<br>
