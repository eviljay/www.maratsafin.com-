                        start, this is Marat's third career Tennis Masters Series 
                        final, the second of the year and the last one he lost 
                        to Gustavo Kuerten and he's also trying to win his third 
                        ATP title. First question in the front.<br>

                  <b>REPORTER:</b> Marat, from what the television showed, you 
                  looked as surprised as Wayne did at what was happening at the 
                  end of the match when he was penalized. Can you just talk about 
                  what happened from your point of view?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> Simple and also a very difficult thing. Because 
                  if we start from the beginning, it starts with the ball abuse 
                  from him. He throw the ball out of the court. I mean, it's a 
                  little bit, I think sometimes it's not right because you have 
                  12,000 people watching us. I hope they enjoy our game. And why, 
                  because he throw the ball out of the court? <br>
                  I mean, he didn't kill anybody, he didn't shout, he didn't say 
                  any bad words. I mean, he was nervous. It's a semifinal and 
                  the people, I think, they understood perfectly this. I think 
                  the result is not something strange. Okay, it's a warning, right. 
                  And after, in the last game, 15-love, it was a winner, on his 
                  forehand. For me, the ball was in. So the linesman, he said, 
                  "Out." So I just went like this (indicating). Because I saw 
                  clearly that it was in. Because I'm not this kind of people 
                  if the ball is out I start to discuss. For me it was in, so 
                  that's why I just put my hands on the head. Also, Rudi, he overrule 
                  it. I think, if I am talking from his part, from Wayne, why 
                  he has to overrule it, when the score is 6-5 -- it's 6-5 or 
                  5-4? 5-4, 15-love, and for 15-all. Why overrule, if you never 
                  overrule during all the match? Also a strange situation. <br>
                  I think that it's also a little bit absurd when he stop. I mean, 
                  when he stopped. It's okay. It's 12,000 people, he stopped, 
                  he didn't play I don't know for one minute, it doesn't matter. 
                  It make him -- he took too much time between the points. It's 
                  a little bit strange. But the rules are the rules. I can understand 
                  Rudi, and I can understand Wayne. But, I mean, it's difficult 
                  to say, "No, Wayne is right" or "Rudi is right." I mean, Rudi, 
                  he has his rules and he has to do it. Also, it's difficult to 
                  decide at an important moment if the ball was in or the ball 
                  was out. You cannot overrule it in the end of the match if you 
                  didn't overrule it during all the match. So, it's a little bit 
                  strange situation.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER:</b> Marat, after all that was said and done, you 
                  served for the match and he just let's the ball go and doesn't 
                  even make an attempt. Did that bother you, or were you surprised 
                  that he didn't even attempt?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> No, actually, I can understand him perfectly. 
                  When the guy, they overruled his point, for him it's "Guys, 
                  I'm trying to win this match and you make me this mistake." 
                  Or whatever. It's a little bit strange. So he said, "Okay. If 
                  you do like this, I will do like that." And the people they 
                  understood perfectly, no? So it's a little bit -- it's much 
                  easier for me, but actually -- I'm not happy because he stopped 
                  the ball. I think he didn't have so many chances to beat me 
                  from 40-love. I don't think that -- if he'd returned once, okay. 
                  But I have a little more of advantage.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER:</b> Marat, after having a long, tough match, beating 
                  Pete Sampras last night, how much of a sense was there that 
                  you -- maybe a let down, trying to pump yourself back up? Because 
                  you started off looking like you were going to finish Ferreira 
                  off early, but then you let him back into the match. Was there 
                  a bit of a let down for you?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> No, I think I have enough experience, I don't 
                  have to -- just because I beat Pete Sampras, it's not the end 
                  of the world, unfortunately, it's not. I just forgot it. I knew 
                  that I had to play against Wayne, it's another difficult match. 
                  It's a good opportunity to be in the final. So you don't think 
                  about Pete, or I beat Pete. I know he's the best player in the 
                  world, but, I mean, that's over. I beat him yesterday. Today 
                  is another day. You have to work also, you have to start from 
                  the beginning, from 0-0, and trying to beat Wayne. It's a little 
                  bit different what happened with me because I had the match 
                  almost done, 6-2, 4-3, and serve or something like. But it was 
                  a question of -- I just stopped, I didn't move enough to play. 
                  Because I thought that, okay, I will put the ball in and he 
                  will miss it. But he almost beat me. It was a question not because 
                  of Pete Sampras, because I think I just stopped. I get a little 
                  maybe afraid at some points, but that was the point.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER:</b> You played Andre in Paris, and you played Gustavo 
                  for the last Masters Series. Now you play Harel Levy. How do 
                  you feel about that?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> The same like I felt for all the finals. Because 
                  if the person is in the final, that means that he's playing 
                  great tennis. I mean, he passed through the qualis. He beat 
                  so many guys. He beat something like this.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>TOUR OFFICIAL:</b> Seven. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> Seven, eight. But I think it means that he's 
                  playing his best tennis. He can beat me. If he beat Novak, he 
                  beat Grosjean, he beat Golmard, why he cannot beat me? I'm also 
                  thinking about like this about him. If I beat Sampras, I beat 
                  Ferreira, I beat Pavel, I beat Bjorkman and Escude, why not 
                  Levy? It is a little bit same situation, but I know for you 
                  guys maybe Levy doesn't sound a lot, but for me it's because 
                  I have to be in the court tomorrow, I have to try to beat him. 
                  It's a little bit different. If he's in the final, he's in good 
                  shape. <br>
                  <b><br>
                  REPORTER: </b>This is a bit of a crazy question, about your 
                  coaches. Can I make some suggestion to you about coaches and 
                  you say what you think, just for fun?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> What?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER:</b> I'll mention some coaches and -- you're looking 
                  for a coach still, aren't you?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> Yes.<br>
                  <b><br>
                  REPORTER: </b>So it's better if you have a coach who speaks 
                  your language, so what about Cherkasov? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> Cherkasov? I talked about him, but the point 
                  is I don't want to lose him like a friend. It's more important 
                  to have Cherky like a friend, not like a coach. Because if there 
                  is -- something happen, something, one small misunderstanding, 
                  I will lose him like friend. And I don't want this. I prefer 
                  to find another coach, another guy that I don't know so well 
                  like Cherky, because he is too nice for me, a nice guy, and 
                  I don't want to lose him.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER:</b> If you want someone who speaks the language, 
                  what about a Spanish player like Javier Sanchez, or Sergio Casal, 
                  something like that?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> He has enough millions in the bank account 
                  to work with me. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER:</b> Do you have anybody in mind at all?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> Unfortunately, no. But I have time and I'm 
                  not doing so bad without coaches. I mean, I would have to think 
                  about this, but I will try to think about the coaching after 
                  U.S. Open, after the Super 9's, after the Grand Slams, and after 
                  I have enough time to think.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>TOUR OFFICIAL:</b> Anything else for Marat? All right.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> Thank you very much. <br>
