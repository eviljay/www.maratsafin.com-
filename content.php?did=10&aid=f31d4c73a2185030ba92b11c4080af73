<DIV id=showartstitle_top><STRONG>Safin defeats Davydenko in Dubai first round</STRONG></DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Marat Safin returned from a seven month lay-off to beat his compatriot Nikolay Davydenko ranked 5 in the world and seeded 3, 4-6 6-2 6-2 here at the Dubai Duty Free Championships. <BR><BR>Safin admitted that he felt he had little chance when he heard the draw; "I was thinking that I could have a better draw. Davydenko has done really well, made the semifinals of Grand Slams, and playing with a lot of confidence. He played well in Australia, and to play him after seven months out is really tough because you think that you are not going to win." <BR><BR>It certainly looked like his feelings were justified in the first set, making a number of unforced errors, particularly on his forehand which often went metres long of the baseline. Davydenko on the other hand was solid off the ground, feeding off Safin's pace, counterpunching with supreme efficiency from the baseline. He took the opening set by virtue of a single break of serve in the fifth game when his opponent double faulted. However, he had to fight hard to close it out, saving three breaks points in the process. By this time Safin's rhythm had improved out of sight, timing the ball better and serving with authority. He took control of the second set breaking Davydenko's opening serve with a forehand winner down the line. A further break of serve gave Safin the set 6-2 as Davydenko mishit his forehand wide. <BR><BR>Safin was motoring as he broke Davydenko's first service game of the final set to love and raced into a 3-0 lead as he had done in the second set. The final set in fact was a carbon copy of the previous set as Safin went on to break Davydenko at 5-2 with a clean off -forehand winner to take the match. <BR><BR>Safin was surprised by his victory after such a long absence; "It is a big surprise. In the first set I thought I had no chance whatsoever. Everything was coming very fast in the first set, and I felt lost and tense on the court. Everything was a little bit uncomfortable." <BR><BR>For Davydenko, it was a huge disappointment to lose to his fellow Russian; "He played good, not perfect. Made a lot of mistakes in the first set, but not so many in the second set. It was tough for me to control the ball as I think this surface is fast compared to indoor which I have just played. I don't think I played so good." He does think though that Safin can return to the top; "He is a good player - can be top 10. Good serve, forehand, backhand. He plays fast and can play very good." <BR><BR>By Andre Jones (in Dubai)</DIV></td>
