<td class="article-body"><P><STRONG>Safin speaks his mind</STRONG> <BR>By Jill Lieber USA TODAY</P>
<P>Off the court, Marat Safin turns into an even more open book, spending hours signing autographs for fans and spewing quotes for the media. <BR>Some of his gems:</P>
<P>On his lack of focus - quote "There are people who give the advice who don't really know what a person feels, what's going on inside of me. Everybody has their own fears, own problems, own complications. Something doesn't just allow you to break through, to make it happen." unquote.</P>
<P>On his on-court behavior - quote "You can't fight your genes. I'm Russian, but I'm 100% Muslim. All the Muslim people are passionate, stubborn. We have hot blood."unquote</P>
<P>On the skepticism about his Australian Open win - quote "Who (cares) about the world? Who (cares) about the opinion of other people? No offense, but I have enough pride to continue in this way, and I have enough brain to make sure that it doesn't slip away again". unquote</P>
<P>Born in communist Russia, Safin started playing tennis when he was 6. His father, Misha, is a director of a small tennis club in Moscow. His mother, Rausa Islanova, a tennis coach, pushed him and his sister, Dinara Safina, who turned 19 Wednesday and is ranked No. 38 in the world, onto the court. But Safin played for the Spartak Moscow youth soccer team and wanted nothing to do with tennis.<BR>"Maybe I was unhappy, but I had no other choice," he says. "My mother said I would have more chances to become a tennis player than a football player."<BR>He quickly outgrew the substandard facilities and equipment in Moscow. "It was really impossible to break through in Russia. We couldn't buy any balls. We really didn't have any courts, no rackets, nothing. And no people to practice with."<BR>When he was 14, his parents solicited financial backing and sent him to a private tennis school in Valencia, Spain. "It is for the opportunity to do something big," says Safin, who became fluent in Spanish in six months. "Why not do it? Because otherwise you might not have a chance."<BR><U>Fame comes too quickly</U> <BR>Three years later, in 1997, Safin, then 17, turned pro, and the following year he put himself on the map at the French Open with upsets of Andre Agassi and defending champion Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil. <BR>He won his first ATP title in 1999.During the first 41/2 months of 2000, Safin struggled just to win a match, throwing tantrums and pulverizing rackets at every event. He threatened to quit. Then he turned it around, winning an ATP-leading seven titles, including the U.S. Open.<BR>He led the ATP in singles matches won (73) and finals reached (nine) and was second in singles matches played (100), one behind countryman Yevgeny Kafelnikov. He became the youngest to end No. 2 since 19-year-old Boris Becker in 1986 and the first under 21 to win at least seven titles in a year since Mats Wilander won nine in '83.<BR>Winning the U.S. Open at 20 was the best, and the worst, thing that happened to Safin. "I had money. I had a house in Valencia. I had five cars - one was a Ferrari. What else does a 20-year-old kid need?"<BR>Says his sister: "He wasn't ready. It came so fast. Money came. He didn't realize, and he started to have more fun."<BR>Safin lost his focus and went into a slow fall, burdened by fame, fortune, injuries and a lack of desire. In 2001 he got to the quarterfinals of Wimbledon and the semifinals of the U.S. Open. In 2002 he was runner-up in the Australian Open and a semifinalist in the French but lost in the round of 64 in Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. <BR>In 2003, he made headlines at the Australian Open for the three gorgeous blondes in his player's box, then dropped out of sight the rest of the year, plummeting to No. 77, his game and confidence destroyed by a nagging left wrist injury.<BR>"Once you have bad losses, people speak and you listen," he says. "You start to believe that maybe it's who you are. You are <BR>a perfectionist, you want to do everything perfect. ... After a while, you don't believe you're good enough."<BR>Safin again threatened to quit. But after much soul-searching, he decided it would be better to face the past&nbsp;- and discard it.<BR>"I had all this stuff," he says. "It wasn't realistic. I'm not a materialistic person. So I sold all my cars. ... I didn't want to regret after my career was over that I didn't really do what I had to do."<BR><U>Growing into his success </U><BR>His new, never-say-die attitude was evident at the 2004 Australian Open. Although he lost in the final to Federer, he played 21 hours and 6 minutes in the tournament. His 30 sets were the most in a Grand Slam in the Open era, tying Harold Solomon's mark at Roland Garros in 1976. <BR>Safin jumped from No. 86 to No. 32.Heartened by his success, he and his management team approached Lundgren about becoming his coach. After seven years with Federer, though, he needed time to chill. Last May, Lundgren signed on.<BR>"It's like a puzzle," Lundgren says. "You start with all of the things you can see that can be better. You can't change everything overnight. It takes time."<BR>When he lost in the first round in the 2004 U.S. Open, Safin again threatened to quit. "He said, 'I can be a top-30 player, but the way I play, I want to do something else,' " Lundgren recalls. "I said, 'Come on, man. Take a few days off before you make a decision like that.' "<BR>Safin then won three ATP titles, including two ATP Masters Series events, and finished in the top four for the third time in five years.<BR>Lundgren has pushed Safin to commit himself to a regimented physical fitness and nutritional program. Safin has hired a chiropractor to travel with him on tour. He'll also travel to Valencia to work with a sports-specific personal trainer.<BR>Lundgren also has gotten Safin to understand he needs to keep his emotions in check. "Before, he would hang his head, bust a racket, throw up his hands, say, 'I can't play, I'm so tired,' " Lundgren says. "Now, he's angry&nbsp;- it's over. That's important."<BR>Safin's sister says he's so much more focused and aware of his emotions that he took her aside before her match against Maria Sharapova at Indian Wells in March and told her not to get upset.<BR>More important, Lundgren has convinced Safin that if he doesn't try to get the most out of his enormous talent, he'll have major regrets. <BR>Says Safin: "I've let my perfectionism go. I've learned to accept the losses. I've realized I can't waste any moment being unhappy. I want to play tennis until I can't. Why not enjoy it?"<BR><BR><BR><BR></P></td>
