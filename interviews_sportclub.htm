                    <br>
                    <b>Marat I came to you with a claim.</b><br>
                    I listen attentively to you.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>To what you want listen now? You have quit m foreign trip.</b><br>
                    Sorry. I didn't want it.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>So why didn't you said &quot;yes&quot; to an interview 
                    somewhere in the sunny Spain? The editing was ready to pay 
                    for the trip, but your agents said that Safin is only ready 
                    to talk with the russian press in the capital of your home 
                    country, Moscow, the city of our hero.</b><br>
                    About the city-hero I didn't say anything, that was added 
                    by you, What concern Spain, I dodn't live there anymore. Months 
                    ago. Almost one year.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Where did you live now?</b><br>
                    In Monaco. I had bought there a flat in Monte-Carlo.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Also not a bad place. I would also have accepted to travel 
                    to that place.</b><br>
                    Done! Next time we will do this in that way.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Seriously, Marat, it seems to me that you avoid meetings 
                    with russain journalists abroad, so that we can't interrogate, 
                    if you're still our or not.<br>
                    </b>What does it mean? Russian or not? Sure. How it can be 
                    otherwise?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Really, Marat, it can be otherwise.</b><br>
                    I lived many years not in Russia, but I play always for our 
                    team and that with a big pleasure. You can say that I'm proud 
                    of to be part of it.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>You can say it or are you really proud?</b><br>
                    As if you suspect me of something…<br>
                    Here, in Russia, are living my teachers, friends, I play for 
                    them too, can you understand it? When the Sport Palais get 
                    full and they start shouting your name or chanting &quot;Russia!Russia!&quot; 
                    every cosmopolitan person would became a patriot. No, there 
                    was never a question before me to change my nationality.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Are you ashamed sometimes of your country?</b><br>
                    It can be also differently. It gripped me with anger, when 
                    I see on CNN or BBC reports about the russian mafia. They 
                    still tell stories, in the west, about homeless persons and 
                    boozers in the streets of Moscow and St. Petersburg. As if 
                    in Russia people freeze to death in the backyards and have 
                    nothing to eat. As if you can think, that no one suffer from 
                    hunger in the west, that there is no crime and no problems 
                    with alcohol and drugs. I was few times in New Yorck and I 
                    know very good what Bronx and Harlem is.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Do you go for a walk?</b><br>
                    I'm not an enemy of my own health, right? I saw enough out 
                    of the window of my car… You understand, if you have the wish, 
                    you can do a terrific report about every town, even of the 
                    most beautiful one. However, in the west they prefer to show 
                    their life from the parade side, but penetrate to us through 
                    the cellar…<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Doy you were asked about the &quot;Kursk&quot;?</b><br>
                    I don't have the right to answer to such question, when foreigner 
                    ask me. Who I am, to talk about these themes? You have to 
                    have information, to know what is really happened with that 
                    ship. Who does give that information? I only make use of information 
                    catching in the newspaper or on television. That's why I can't 
                    give a censorship.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>I'm not a foreigner, Marat, share it with me.</b><br>
                    I don't have my own oppinion. My relationshipto the happening 
                    is exclusively on an emotional level. Certainly, it was a 
                    terrific tragedy. It's even horrible to think about, what 
                    the survivors felt in the iron grave. Most of them were the 
                    same age that I'm of. Terrible death, I don't wish such anybody. 
                    It's hard for me to talk about it.<br>
                    I don't want …<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Was there anybody who wants to put you in politics?</b><br>
                    I don't need it. Even don't ready. Even if such a crazy idea 
                    would come to my mind, when I should occupy with politics? 
                    You had asked me, where I live now. Mainly - on the way. The 
                    whole year journies, that's why I moved to Europe. Mor comfortable. 
                    First I settled down in Valencia, I left there a flat, now 
                    there are living my mother and Dinara, my sister. Then I moved 
                    to Monte-Carlo. I can't say that were regularly there. Rather, 
                    drop in from time to time. For me it's very comfortable there. 
                    Good place, place where I can train, the beach is not far. 
                    By the way, I doubt, that I can live in Monaco the whole time. 
                    It's all the same to me, whether in Moscow in the Gorkyi street… 
                    Or how it is called now? In the Twerskoyi street. I received 
                    in Monaco the status of residence, but many sportsmen/women 
                    do it in these way not wanting to pay to much for taxes. I 
                    think, there is no criminal or patriotic in it.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Without any doubt, but it's sounds very rational. But you 
                    don't seem to be a person leading by his arguments of the 
                    reasons.</b><br>
                    If I would only live with emotions, I wouldn't have reached 
                    such a success in tennis and then our meeting wouldn't take 
                    place. We would nothing have to talk about.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Who knews? Maybe you would shine in something else.</b><br>
                    Out of question. Only on courts. Nothing else has shined to 
                    me, nowhere. And even here could all come about differently. 
                    You know, probably, that at the beginning of that season I 
                    had a line of misfortune. I was seriously thinking about to 
                    stop to appearances and to leave tennis. Fortunately I got 
                    over this crisis. I won one tournament, a second, a third…<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Yes, yes, became N° 1 of the world… To be honest, I don't 
                    even want to imagine how many people there are now around 
                    you. Especially after the win of the US Open. Certainly there 
                    are a lot of thirsty people warming themselves in the sunbeams 
                    of alien fame. Do you learned to filter your contacts, seperate 
                    the unless?</b><br>
                    You ask me questions with a philosophical subtitle…<br>
                    Sometimes it's hard to differ sincere feelings from benefit. 
                    I don't come to people with a warning, don't expect from them 
                    meanness. That's why I sometimes come in awkward situations. 
                    There were situations when someone made use of my openness, 
                    familiarity and maybe naivete to doublecross me. Yes, I had 
                    burnt my fingers sometimes. Can't do anything. I'm learning.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Do you began to blew on water afterwards?</b><br>
                    To fresh the insurance? No. I know who my friends are. They've 
                    stayed with me when I was N° 40 in the ranking and not waited 
                    that I climb up to N° 1…<br>
                    What concerns the others… Quite honestly, I don't want to 
                    chang myself, to become suspicious and cautions.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Inside you can still be yourself, but outside it's better 
                    for you to put on a mask.<br>
                    </b>I had tried it. Doesn't work. I know that it is necessary 
                    and useable in life, but…<br>
                    <b><br>
                    </b>I'm a person from whose face you can read everything.<b><br>
                    Are you able to say &quot;NO&quot;?</b><br>
                    <br>
                    No… I said it right now to you, but in that situations where 
                    I have to say it, I am usually embarrassed. You don't have 
                    to explain it, I know it myself: that's not correct. Few times 
                    I got burnt because of that, nethertheless I can't do anything 
                    against that. Sometimes I see: someone want to ask me something, 
                    probably for money and instead of sending him immediately 
                    for away, I start to get confused inside to invent reasons 
                    and forms for a concellation. That's my money, so why I have 
                    to hand them over to unknown persons?<br>
                    Many have the impression that we, the sportsmen/women, don't 
                    know how to spend our fees. That we only sit and wait until 
                    an unlucky person come to us, tell us his terrific story and 
                    we ahve a good cry and start to stuff their pockets with dollars. 
                    I'm not heartless and cruel, but to help all poor people is 
                    not in my might.<br>
                    I can't explain everyone that I have to pay current issues, 
                    food, hotels, flight, taxes from the fee and from the rest

                    Listen, millionaire? I say it to you!&quot;<br>

                    to say that I'm not a cool one, but a quite normal one. They 
                    wouldn't believe it yet.<br>
                    In reality nobody rolled out the red carpet for me, I had

                    Very much. Up to tears. I had written letters: &quot;Fetch 
                    me from here&quot;. Try to imagine yourself instead of a hungry 
                    14 years old boy ending up in a strange country. You don't 
                    know the language, around you all people are strange…<br>
                    That's why it is horrid, that bystanders thinks I always drive 
                    around in chocolate.<br>

                    Never before. I said to you that periodical people turned 
                    up thinking that it is their duty to &quot;reprimand the stuffed

                    Incidentally, I won't be an unselfish person. I'm also interested 
                    in the price money of a tournament and I fight for advantageous

                    Five years with all might. That means that I have to commite

                    nothing in your pockets. That means, that you have to go out 
                    on courts again, hit the ball, win matches…<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>You was certainly asked that few times before: which motivationhas 
                    a person achieving the highest step? You was already the best 
                    tennis player in the world. What can you force to sweat again 
                    in the trainings, to spread on the courts? Not money, right?</b><br>
                    Not money. You know that it is hard to stay on the top, then 
                    go to the top. That's my motivation: show everybody and myself, 
                    that you are not accidentally there.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>But you can't climb further. Every way let downwards.</b><br>
                    Please, don't remember! If you look downwards - you can fall 
                    deep. A 50 ranked player climb upwards, a 100 ranked player 
                    fall downwards… Both of them don't play so bad tennis and 
                    maybe not even worser than me.<br>

                    <b>Evgenyi Kafelnikov went through all this. Does he adviced 
                    you you were to hide matches?</b><br>
                    To be honest, I didn't asked him: terrible. Evgenyi would 
                    say only one thing: to hold out. There is no way back. Sure, 
                    now it is harder until all the victories. But I knew, to what 
                    I went. Sometimes I catch myself thinking: further 5 years 
                    such a torture? Better die.<br>

                    <b>That, Marat, you don't have to do. You are young, rich,

                    Thank you for the nice words! Married me! Did I do to you 
                    something bad?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>After your words marriage is a dammed thing?</b><br>
                    It's too early to think about this. First the beard should 
                    grew.<br>

                    <b>So, let it grow!</b><br>
                    It doesn't grow! I still don't shave.<br>

                    <b>Please?</b><br>
                    So. You can touch my chin, smooth, no bristles. I say it: 
                    I'm still young, even start to become a man.<br>
