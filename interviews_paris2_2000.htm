                  MODERATOR: </b> Questions, please. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Your tennis was very good. I'm just wondering about 
                  your mathematics now. We're trying to work out whether this 
                  performance here means that you are at the head of the entry 
                  system rankings now. Do you know that?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> You mean if I'm No. 1 in the world?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Not just the race, but the entry system. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yes, because as everybody knows, the entry 
                  system there is a -- the points that are going with the -- Pete, 
                  he won the tournament in Hannover. So Monday of this week is 
                  -- the ATP, these guys, they gonna take all the 600 points. 
                  So mathematically, I'm gonna be No. 1. But first of all, it's 
                  nice. I'm satisfied that a lot of people helped me to be there 
                  at the top, but also it will be unbelievable if I'm gonna finish 
                  the year. But everybody knows that we're always fighting for 
                  -- everybody's playing great tennis here today. Magnus, I think 
                  he had some opportunities, but I'll be there. And now I would 
                  like to finish the year No. 1.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Given the way that you started the year, could you 
                  ever have envisioned being in this position at this time of 
                  this year? <br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> Definitely I would not -- I didn't think about 
                  this, because I start the year, it was horrible. I didn't think 
                  that I'm gonna even be in the Top 20. Now I'm fighting for No. 
                  1. I'm playing great tennis with a lot of confidence, and it's 
                  great. I'm satisfied that finally I just -- I came back for 
                  the better ranking, to be there and fight during the whole summer, 
                  playing great tennis and fight for No. 1. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> This means that in the beginning of next year, whatever 
                  you do, you will remain No. 1. For the first three months, you 
                  have nothing to lose.<br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> I'll be glad. I would like. But I know that 
                  it's tough. It's tough, because you have to play every week. 
                  But you know each week that everybody wants to be there on the 
                  first draw: Guga, Magnus, Pete, other guys, Yevgeny, they gonna 
                  fight for it. You have to, you know, to be better than them. 
                  <br>
                  <b><br>
                  Q.</b> First three months, you don't need to.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yes, I do. Yes, I need. Guga's defending, 
                  also, I think, in Australia. So from the beginning of the year, 
                  they gonna fight to be there on the top. Who's gonna be stronger? 
                  I want to be there.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> You were hitting the ball really strongly today. Is 
                  that the best you've played since the US Open final? <br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> Probably, yes. But also, like I said before, 
                  it's, you know, Juan Carlos, he didn't play his best tennis. 
                  He was too tired. I saw it, I mean the first point. He didn't 
                  arrive good to the ball. He made many mistakes. The concentration 
                  wasn't the same. It's difficult to make a good tennis. So I 
                  just had to make my game. And knowing this, that he's not playing 
                  his best tennis, it gives you more confidence. You play more 
                  relaxed because you know that each moment that you gonna break 
                  him and that you are better than him because you have more, 
                  you know -- physically, you are better this day, today.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> It seemed that you seemed to have perfected the Pete 
                  Sampras slam dunk today.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yes, I learn from him. From so many times 
                  on the TV. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> You played much better than at the beginning of the 
                  indoor season. What adjustment did you make in your game during 
                  all those weeks you played since Vienna? <br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: </b>I think the confidence is the question. It's 
                  when you have a confidence, you can play great tennis. When 
                  you don't have confidence, you are losing, you know, first -- 
                  one week you're losing the first round, second week, you are 
                  already afraid, you know, of playing. Sometimes you think twice 
                  when you hit the ball. You think, "Ohhh, it's gonna be in or 
                  it's gonna be out?" And you don't know. You lose again, and 
                  you're losing confidence. Because to lose the confidence is 
                  very easy. To get the confidence back, it's very tough. So what 
                  happen? Olympic Games I lost to Santoro. Next week I lost in 
                  Vienna to Escude. Already, confidence -- is no confidence at 
                  all. You have to start from the zero, playing points by points, 
                  and try to find your confidence. And finally in St. Petersburg 
                  I found it in the final. Even losing, it was a tough match. 
                  I won it. And here I'm playing great tennis, I think. And I 
                  hope I'm gonna play the same way tomorrow in the final. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>Tomorrow you could actually become the only player 
                  to win two Masters Series this year. Does it mean anything to 
                  you?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Of course. It's nice. Also, it gives me 
                  -- it will give me points to go little bit forward from Guga, 
                  from Pete, and it's gonna be one more tournament for my tennis 
                  career. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>Talking about Ferrero, does he have the "Marat Safin 
                  complex" now?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>I don't think so. Just all the time we're 
                  playing against each other, I'm just more confidence, playing 
                  better. That's it. Today he was tired. I don't think we'll have 
                  to count this match, because it wasn't equal. Because he was 
                  too tired. That's it. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>All the players who became No. 1 said in the past 
                  that it was more difficult to stay up there than to reach that 
                  goal. What would you be afraid of more about yourself being 
                  at the top: To lose consistency, to lose concentration, to have 
                  no more desire to fight or to work, whatever? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think it's already big mistake to think 
                  -- to be afraid. Be afraid of what? Because if you gonna go 
                  down in the ranking, that's life. Everybody wants to be there 
                  on the first draw. I think you have to still playing and still 
                  count the point, you know, not to defend, "Oh, next week I have 
                  to defend the final of Rome," or, "I have to defend the final 
                  of Australia," or the winner of Scottsdale. That's not the point. 
                  You're No. 1. You have to count all the points. Each time, every 
                  tournament you have to give all your best; and if you are lucky, 
                  if you are, you know, in good shape, you gonna be there. But 
                  also, everybody have to be there. Nothing gonna happen if you 
                  go No. 3, because always you can come back. You don't have to 
                  be afraid to be No. 1.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> I shouldn't have used the word "afraid," but what 
                  would worry you more? Would you have to fight against yourself 
                  in order to stay up there?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Another thing, you don't have to fight against 
                  yourself. You gonna say it's enough to fight against Kuerten, 
                  against Philippoussis. You have to enjoy the life. No. 1 in 
                  the world, maybe it's the last time in your life until your 
                  tennis career. You have to enjoy it. If it's one week, that's 
                  great. You have to play there, you have to play each tournament 
                  thinking that, "I want to be No. 1 for a long time." Not for 
                  one week and you go. But also, I mean, one week at No. 1, it's 
                  great. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> You talked about Philippoussis. What's your thought 
                  on his game and on tomorrow's final? <br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> His -- I mean Mark is in a good shape. He's 
                  playing very good because he passed through some tough matches 
                  against Dominik Hrbaty. It's a difficult match. If you lose, 
                  you lose. If you win this match 7-6 in the third, it's already 
                  you gonna be in the Finals -- semifinals for sure. I mean, in 
                  tennis, it's like this. You win one match, one tough match playing 
                  badly, and after you're playing better and better with a lot 
                  of confidence. Because these kind of matches give you confidence. 
                  So he's playing now unbelievable tennis. It's great. It's perfect. 
                  Serve, volley, baseline is great. But tomorrow is final, so 
                  you never know what is gonna happen there. I'm going to fight. 
                  I'm gonna build my game since the first point.And if I will 
                  have any chances to beat him, I will try to, you know, to push 
                  him and put him under pressure. It's gonna be the key of the 
                  match: To push him since the beginning of the match. And let's 
                  see what's gonna happen with Mark.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>Before this year, you had only one title in Boston. 
                  Now you have a nice collection. Do you think that you play the 
                  Finals now differently than you used to play a final like last 
                  year here? Is it a different match now? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think so. Because I have more experience 
                  in the Finals. I played enough this year, and what, is nothing 
                  else. It's just experience. Probably I'm not gonna be so afraid 
                  of being in a final and not making a really good score on the 
                  court. I just gonna be there on the court. Not to say how many 
                  am I gonna win tomorrow. I'm gonna be there to win the tournament.I 
                  want it. I want to win one more tournament, especially here 
                  in Paris where I start my tennis career, at Roland Garros. It 
                  will be great, you know, to win here at least one tournament. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> It's the end of the season. Everybody's tired. Yet 
                  you seem to be playing your best tennis, and you look fresh. 
                  Are you as fresh as you look?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Because I start very late. (Laughter.)<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>You played more than the others in the last six months. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yes, but I played -- I didn't play first 
                  four months. I couldn't win one set, one game. So now I can, 
                  you know, finally I found confidence. I can play my best tennis. 
                  At least end of the year, why not?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>So you feel as fresh as you look? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No. (Laughter.) <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>Would you have preferred in the term of the race, 
                  would you have preferred to play Guga in the final? Just for 
                  the race?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> If, if, if, if, if. If it gonna rain tomorrow, 
                  everybody gonna die. I don't know. The fire gonna come. I think 
                  the winner is in the final. Who is the better player is in the 
                  final. So this case it was Mark. What can you do? You can't 
                  think about "If" Guga would win. It would be easier to play 
                  against him. I don't know. I have Mark, he won the match against 
                  Guga, he's playing better for Guga for today at least. So probably 
                  for you, for the people, it would be nice to see the final Kuerten 
                  and Safin. Who gonna have enough balls to win, "New Balls," 
                  to win the title? (Laughter.) But in this case, it was Mark 
                  and not the "New Balls." So that's it. <br>
