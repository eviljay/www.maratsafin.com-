                  takes a 2-1 lead over the Slovak Republic into the final day 
                  of their Davis Cup by NEC first round tie in Bratislava. Yevgeny 
                  Kafelnikov and Marat Safin withstood a fine recovery by Dominik 
                  Hrbaty and Jan Kroslak to complete a 6-4, 6-4, 2-6, 7-6(7) victory 
                  in two hours and 38 minutes. <br>
                  <br>
                  The Slovaks made a late change to their doubles team, replacing 
                  Karol Kucera, their hero on the opening day, with 27-year-old 
                  Jan Kroslak, who had not played a live rubber since 1998. Their 
                  Captain Miloslav Mecir admitted afterwards that they had tried 
                  to persuade Kucera to take part, but he was tired after his 
                  five-set victory over Safin and wanted to be rested for a potentially 
                  deciding rubber against Kafelnikov on Sunday.<br>
                  <br>
                  However it was not Kroslak, but Dominik Hrbaty who once again 
                  struggled to find his form in the opening two sets, dropping 
                  his serve on three occasions as the Russians opened up a comfortable 
                  advantage. Double faults on crucial occasions proved the Slovak's 
                  undoing against some powerful serving by Safin and deadly returns 
                  by Kafelnikov.<br>
                  <br>
                  Kroslak, the only player not to drop serve during the four-set 
                  encounter, did his best to try and lift Hrbaty's mood. &quot;I 
                  started to make a few jokes. I told him that it was good tactics 
                  to lose the first two sets and that it couldn't get any worse. 
                  It almost worked.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Whether it was Kroslak's jokes or a lack of concentration by 
                  the Russians, the Slovaks enjoyed a mini revival in the third 
                  set. They reeled off four games in a row to take the set 6,2, 
                  and at 1-0 in the fourth, held two break points on Safin's serve.<br>
                  <br>
                  The US Open champion managed to hold his delivery, and when 
                  Hrbaty immediately dropped serve for a fourth time the match 
                  looked over. However roused by the cheers of the 3000 capacity 
                  crowd, the Slovaks saved a match point at 4-5 and took the set 
                  into a tiebreak.<br>
                  <br>
                  After the pairs had exchanged two mini-breaks, Kafelnikov squandered 
                  a second match point when he hit a forehand out over the baseline. 
                  Hrbaty then missed a set point when he hit a backhand return 
                  into the net, before Kafelnikov sealed victory with a backhand 
                  cross-court winner.<br>
                  <br>
                  Afterwards the Olympic champion admitted he was relieved the 
                  match had not gone to a fifth set. &quot;We played pretty solid 
                  in the first two sets. A lack of concentration for a short while 
                  was good enough for the Slovaks to take the third set, and we 
                  were quite fortunate to win in four.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  He added that he thought it was a tactical decision by the Slovaks 
                  not to play Kucera in the doubles. &quot;I think they thought 
                  the doubles match would go the wrong way and wanted to rest 
                  Karol. I have a reputation of playing every match and it doesn't 
                  bother me to play the fifth rubber if necessary.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  A disappointed Hrbaty said that it was not a foregone conclusion 
                  that he would play the opening singles against Safin on Sunday. 
                  &quot;I was very disappointed with my performance today. It 
                  was quite difficult at the beginning for me and I made double 
                  faults at crucial moments.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;The balls bounce lower on this surface and I find it difficult 
                  to change the direction of my shots. I ended up trying too hard 
                  not to make mistakes. There is no reason for Jan not to play 
                  tomorrow. Davis Cup is different and rankings do not count.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Miloslav Mecir added that there was &quot;a lot to consider&quot; 
                  before confirming his nominations an hour before the start of 
                  tomorrow's reverse singles. <br>
