                  MODERATOR: </b> Questions for Marat, please.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Was the last service game in the first set the key 
                  of the match?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think I had also had one opportunity before, 
                  15-40 on his serve, and I couldn't do anything. I think I did 
                  not play well. I did not play tactically well. That was the 
                  problem. I played too passive. It was difficult to, you know, 
                  win this match playing like this. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Was the relief of having beaten Santoro ... <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No. You have to give something more than 
                  just pass the ball over the net. I had to make something more 
                  because he played very well, I think, for his game. He served 
                  well. He played from the baseline well. He didn't miss not so 
                  many balls. But I couldn't do anything. That was a problem. 
                  I just really upset because I lost a big opportunity, you know, 
                  to be a little bit closer to No. 1. I couldn't do this. It's 
                  a little bit -- you get upset with yourself, because I had everything, 
                  serving for the set, and suddenly everything changed. That's 
                  life. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Because you were tired?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No. Tired, no. Tactically, I didn't play 
                  well because I just don't -- I didn't make the point. I just 
                  pass the ball all the time.Probably I would need some help, 
                  but nobody could give me advice. I knew that something I was 
                  doing wrong, because is not possible that he beats me from the 
                  baseline - but he was beating me from the baseline. Something 
                  was wrong. I didn't know what it was. Nobody give me advice. 
                  Q. How important is it you win the campaign for the new generation, 
                  that you succeed in your game? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> What do you mean? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> You're part of the New Balls campaign. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Part of this new generation. How important is it that 
                  you succeed, the other youngsters, win the games? <br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> It's more important for us. We are not thinking 
                  about the promote. On the court, if we are winning, we don't 
                  think about Kiefer, whatever, the new generation, New Balls. 
                  You think about your ranking. I don't want to think about anybody. 
                  That's my job. I want to be No. 1. I don't think about Roger 
                  Federer or Nicolas Kiefer when I play against Rusedski. "I'm 
                  part of it, I'm proud of it." No. Everybody thinks about themselves, 
                  because life is tough. If you don't think about you, nobody 
                  will think about you. You have to think about yourself on the 
                  court, about your life, about what are you doing. If you have 
                  opportunity to be No. 1, you have to do this. Doesn't matter 
                  New Balls, Old Balls, Middle Balls. Just be No. 1, that's it. 
                  Doesn't matter if you are part of this campaign. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Do you think at the time now there is a change of 
                  generations? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, change of generation. I don't want 
                  to, because the old balls will get upset. I think it's not nice 
                  to say that we're the new generation because we have still the 
                  guys like Patrick Rafter, all these guys, 28, 27. They're going 
                  to play four years more, for sure, maybe more. New guys coming, 
                  but nobody's going. More competition going to be there. More 
                  new guys are going to come, and they will try to look for their 
                  places in the Top 20. But it's not going to be change, the new 
                  game, old, they left, no. It's going to be more new guys coming 
                  in, theis going to be tough. <br>
