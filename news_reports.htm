                  takes President's Cup singles title <br>
                  <br>
                  17th of September 2000 TASHKENT, Uzbekistan <br>
                  Russian rising star and U.S. Open champion Marat Safin won his 
                  fifth title of the year Sunday with a smooth <b>6-3, 6-4 </b>defeat 
                  of Italy's Davide Sanguinetti in the President's Cup ATP tournament.<br>
                  The 20-year-old Safin took the singles title in the $500,000 
                  tournament in just one hour and two minutes - then prepared 
                  to head for the Olympics in Sydney, where he is ranked No. 1 
                  on the Russian team. <br>
                  Safin, seeded second, dominated the President's Cup, winning 
                  every match. The towering youth came to the Uzbekistan tournament 
                  fresh from becoming the first Russian to win the U.S. Open, 
                  with a victory last week over American tennis giant Pete Sampras.<br>
                  "I will ask my opponent's forgiveness for playing so well," 
                  Safin, grinning sheepishly, said after Sunday's match. <br>
                  The play started even, but then Safin, playing strongly at the 
                  net, took the lead in the fifth game of the first set and held 
                  it. <br>
                  The win gave Safin his sixth career title, and fifth of this 
                  year alone. In April, he emerged from a slump that almost prompted 
                  him to quit the sport, winning in Barcelona, Mallorca and Toronto 
                  before the U.S. Open victory in New York. </font> </td>

                  Safin - Russian wins US Open title<br>
                  <br>
                  10th of September 2000 NEW-YORK, USA (AP)<br>
                  Marat Safin is the US Open champion! In a one-sided final, he 
                  defeated four-time champion Pete Sampras<b> 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 </b>in 
                  98 minutes. It is the first Grand Slam title for the sixth seeded 
                  Russian. <br>
                  "I never played better tennis than today," a happy Safin said 
                  after the final. "I was very nervous in the last game, but in 
                  the end I was lucky."<br>
                  "I give him all the credit in the world," a gracious Sampras 
                  commented. "He played so well. He had an answer to everything 
                  I tried." <br>
                  Safin was the fresher player and clearly dominated the complete 
                  match. He put Sampras constantly under pressure from the baseline, 
                  made only 12 unforced errors, returned extremely well and played 
                  a couple of impressive backhand passing shots. Sampras, who 
                  was only broken four times in the whole tournament up to the 
                  final, lost his serve four times during the match. By contrast, 
                  Sampras himself had no break points at all up to the very last 
                  game, when Safin was obviously nervous. <br>
                  Both players held serve up to three all in the first set, when 
                  Safin broke Sampras. After 31 minutes, he took the first set 
                  6-4. In the second set, it was the seventh game again that Safin 
                  broke Sampras. Leading 5-3 on Sampras's serve, the Russian played 
                  a brilliant topspin lob to earn a set point. Sampras double 
                  faulted to give Safin the set 6-3. <br>
                  Five times throughout his career, the American managed to come 
                  back from being down 0-2, but Safin was just too strong. He 
                  continued his impressive performance, hitting aces, passing 
                  shots and deep retuns. Towards the end of the set, the Russian 
                  became a bit nervous and allowed Sampras two break points, he 
                  kept cool and converted his first match point in appropriate 
                  style with a backhand passing shot. </font> </td>

                  lifts the trophy - Safin wins Masters Series Toronto<br>
                  <br>
                  6th of August 2000 TORONTO, Canada (AP)<br>
                  Marat Safin is the new Tennis Masters Series Canada champion 
                  after a blistering 6-2, 6-3 win over Harel Levy in the final. 
                  The win marks the first ever Tennis Masters Series title for 
                  the twenty-year-old Russian.<br>
                  But although Safin was simply too big and too strong today, 
                  Levy, who came through qualifying, can still look back on a 
                  career best week. He won seven matches before coming up against 
                  Safin and though he was overpowered he was far from disgraced. 
                  <br>
                  Indeed it was the Isreali who started more brightly, showing 
                  very few nerves in the biggest occasion of his tennis career. 
                  He broke Safin in the Russian's first serve game but despite 
                  his serve malfunctioning, Safin's mammoth ground strokes were 
                  finding their mark with increasing regularity. He broke straight 
                  back and demolished the Levy serve a further two times on his 
                  way to taking the opening set.<br>
                  The pattern continued in the second set, with the Russian dominating 
                  early on and never relinquishing his grip on the match, despite 
                  Levy hanging in for all he was worth.<br>
                  After the match, a delighted Safin warmly congratulated Levy 
                  on his performance and then charmed the crowd with a gracious 
                  speech, thanking them for their support during what has been 
                  the most successful week of his career. <br>
                  The Russian will move to number 4 in the ATP Champions Race 
                  when the standings are released on Monday. While Levy can temper 
                  his disappointment with the fact that his performance here has 
                  already earned him direct entry into the Tennis Masters Series 
                  Cincinnati draw next week. </font> </td>

                  back - Safin rallies to defeat Pavel in Stuttgart<br>
                  <br>
                  19th of July 2000 STUTTGART, Germany (AP)<br>
                  Third-seededMarat Safin of Russia fought from behind to beat 
                  Andrei Pavel of Romania in three sets Wednesday and reached 
                  the second round of the $1 million ATP Mercedes Cup tennis tournament.<br>
                  Safinwon 5-7, 6-3, 6-3. <br>
                  Up a break and leading 5-2, Safin lost the next five games to 
                  drop the first set, although he had a chance to serve it out 
                  at 5-3. But some loose serving that produced a string of double-faults 
                  left the Russian a set down.<br>
                  Safin quickly rebounded, however, and cruised through the next 
                  two to advance. The Russian has had a strong season on clay, 
                  after a slow start to the year. He won back-to-back titles in 
                  Barcelona and Mallorca, then played in the final of the Masters 
                  Series in Hamburg and reached the quarterfinals of the French 
                  Open.</font> </td>
