                    Q. Marat, is Mikhail Youzhny still the most famous guy in 
                    Russia,<br>
                    or are you getting a little bit more popular?<br>
<br>
A. I think not. Like I said, he is playing great. I think 
                    you can see. But definitely, he needs to work a little bit 
                    on his shots, and I think he can be one of the famous, famous 
                    tennis players in Russia very soon, because I think he has 
                    great potential. He need to work a little bit more.<br>
<br>
Q. What happened there, Marat? You lost your head?<br>
<br>
A. No, I think it's just I'm - just I'm so disappointed that 
                    these kind of things happen to me with the same chair umpire. 
                    It happened to me, in Dusseldorf. He took me a point, he took 
                    me a game, for nothing. And today, there was - had nothing 
                    against him, had nothing against linesmen. We were playing 
                    great tennis, and the guy just - he wants to show off, I don't 
                    know what is his problem. The guy almost destroyed our game. 
                    Playing so good, everything; I almost lost the set.<br>
<br>
Q. Unsportsmanlike conduct - you threw the ball at - - - 
                    ?<br>
<br>
A. I didn't make anything. I just, the ball was - - -<br>
<br>
Q. You sent a ball against - - -?<br>
<br>
A. No, I sent the ball, I sent the ball. I tried to give 
                    to ballboy, so wasn't right. I didn't want - why I have to 
                    hit the linesman with the ball? What do you think I am? So 
                    stupid to do this in front of everybody? I'm winning match, 
                    I'm playing easily, I'm playing great. Why I have to do this 
                    against - yeah, everybody can make mistake. But the chair 
                    umpire, he has to use his brain sometimes. And first of all, 
                    I think, when he is talking to somebody, he has to take off 
                    the glasses, as a matter of respect. I hate when somebody 
                    is talking to me with the glasses, and I think it's not right. 
                    And I'm talking to him nicely, and he's talking to me like, 
                    you know, &quot;I'm the king of the court and I can do whatever 
                    I want&quot;. No, it's not right. I have my opinion. I called 
                    the guy who is standing there all the time, and he has to 
                    go with the call of the chair umpire. And what is he doing 
                    there? He is standing there. He has to, he has to look what 
                    is going on in the court. &quot;No, I didn't see the ball&quot;. 
                    What, he didn't see the ball?<br>
<br>
Q. Even if you don't hit person in the public, or the linesman, 
                    on purpose, you can get a code violation for that?<br>
<br>
A. For what?<br>
<br>
Q. Because players have been defaulted for hitting the public. 
                    They want to hit the back of the court. They miss, they hit 
                    someone in the public. It's not on purpose, but - - -<br>
<br>
A. Did I make it? I just tried to give the ball to the ballboy. 
                    Is it normal, or not? Or we have to, you know, give to the 
                    ball, take the balls and give to the ballboy in the hands?<br>
<br>
Q. Yes, it was pretty close.<br>
<br>
A. No. Of course, guys, come on. Of course, it easier to 
                    find a solution. You know, &quot;Safin is going nuts on the 
                    court&quot;. Of course, it would be great. You know, the newspaper 
                    will look unbelievable. But it's not right. I have nothing 
                    against anybody. But this guy is, he is crazy.<br>
<br>
Q. As you said last time, shit happens?<br>
<br>
A. Yeah; but it happens, one, twice, three times with the 
                    same chair umpire? Something is wrong.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, when you were saying to take off the glasses, were 
                    you referring to the referee or to the chair umpire?<br>
<br>
A. To the chair umpire. I mean, the referee, he has the lenses, 
                    I think. No, I think it's - I don't - I cannot talk to the 
                    person with the sun glasses. It's a matter of respect, I think, 
                    and he should respect me like I'm respecting him. And he cannot 
                    talk - it's not nice, I think, to talk to me with sun glasses. 
                    I think that's my point.<br>
<br>
Q. Next time you have to bring some sun glasses when you 
                    want to talk to him?<br>
<br>
A. Yes, I will. I mean, definitely, because I'm amazed a 
                    little bit.<br>
<br>
Q. You risked being defaulted there because you said &quot;You're 
                    f- up in the air, in the air&quot;?<br>
<br>
A. What?<br>
<br>
Q. You said some pretty tough things to them?<br>
<br>
A. Yeah, but they - - -<br>
<br>
Q. But - - -<br>
<br>
A. But they don't want even to listen to me. How you want 
                    me to speak to them? He is talking to me with sun glasses. 
                    He is talking to me, you know, he is just, he's doing whatever 
                    he wants on the court. So why should I respect him if he doesn't 
                    respect me?<br>
<br>
Q. Did you get a warning?<br>
<br>
A. Yea, of course.<br>
<br>
Q. Does the matter end there matter, or do you expect to 
                    be fined for that?<br>
<br>
A. No, if - I mean, definitely, I think that people from 
                    ATP, they have to look at the tape. And I'm just amazed that 
                    these kind of things can happen on the court. I mean, think 
                    a little bit logically. I'm winning 6-4, 6-4, and 3-2, I think 
                    - - -<br>
<br>
A. Yeah, 3-2.<br>
<br>
A. And that's it. Why I should hit the linesman with the 
                    ball? I mean, it's just out of his mind. The guy was out. 
                    What can I say? That's just, that's my opinion, and I don't 
                    care. He can fight with me, he can go wherever he wants. But 
                    that's my opinion and it's, and I think I'm right and I'm 
                    going to defend myself. I'm right. I'm hundred per cent right. 
                    And everybody saw it and everybody was, was amazed on the 
                    court. Nobody expect these kind of things from the chair umpire. 
                    But I think he likes to, you know, he likes to be involved 
                    in the match. It's okay. He can play tennis also, after the 
                    tournament.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, you are in the round of 16. You beat a pretty tough 
                    guy today. How happy are you with the kind of tennis you are 
                    playing today?<br>
<br>
A. I'm feeling great, playing well, and getting more and 
                    more confident, and I think I'm improving my serve, I'm improving 
                    my game from the baseline, and then - I'm doing well. Just, 
                    I'm happy with my game. It's just, you know, these are the 
                    things that piss me off. That's it. I don't want to discuss 
                    any more, because I'm playing well and it's just, you know, 
                    I wish that would never happen, something like this, on the 
                    court, tennis court. That's it. Because we were playing great. 
                    I'm playing great. Youzhny is trying, you know. Everybody 
                    wants to give all our best, you know, to the public, to people 
                    who are coming to watch us. That's the thing. Nobody wants 
                    to get, you know, get pissed with anybody; just playing for 
                    the people. That's it.
					<br><br>
Q. Any more questions?<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, you seem to be in the meeting with Pete. You've 
                    arrived first. Are you happy about that? He hasn't quite arrived 
                    yet? <br>
<br>
A. I'm happy. I'm happy to be here, and I'm happy to be here 
                    like a winner.<br>
<br>
Q. Are you playing well enough to win the tournament?<br>
<br>
A. Yeah, I think I have enough, enough game. But as you can 
                    see, we have a very tough draw. I'm playing the winner of 
                    Nicolas Escude and Pete. So it's going to be a tough match. 
                    I think it will be a very great match for the people tonight. 
                    I think Escude can give some trouble to Pete. It will be a 
                    tough match so, I'm looking forward to playing Pete or Nicolas.<br>
<br>
Q. Have you ever met Nicolas?<br>
<br>
A. Yeah, played with him - actually, he retired once, against 
                    me. That's how I won. I never beat him. So it will be nice 
                    to, to have a chance to beat him.<br>
<br>
Q. You said you - - -<br>
<br>
A. It's okay.<br>
<br>
Q. I was just going to change it a little bit. You said you 
                    and Youzhny grew up in the same club. How old were you and 
                    how old was he when you first met each other?<br>
<br>
A. I think he is two years younger than me, so he start - 
                    everybody start in Russia with six years old. So I was 8, 
                    he was 6.<br>
<br>
Q. So you had known him from age 6?<br>
<br>
A. Yeah, for a long time, when he start, when first time 
                    he took a racquet.<br>
<br>
Q. If you play Pete, he beat you the last time you guys played 
                    at the US Open; how do you compare the kind of tennis you 
                    are playing now with New York?<br>
<br>
A. I think I have more confidence. I'm having great time. 
                    I prepared myself very well for this year and I'm doing well, 
                    and definitely, it's going to be different match compared 
                    to US Open. I think I have more chance to make some more games 
                    here than US Open - even to win, I think, because it's a little 
                    bit slower, the court, and I'm moving better, and I'm feeling 
                    well and I'm serving well and playing good, so I have more 
                    chances to beat him here than the US Open.<br>
<br>
Q. Do you have a preference, playing Sampras or Escude?<br>
<br>
A. Both tough in different way. They have a little bit different 
                    style of game. It's a little bit similar, but they both trying 
                    to play serve and volley, but Nicolas has better baseline 
                    than Pete. But also Pete, he has a bigger serve. So you have 
                    to be careful with both of them. Nicolas is also very talented. 
                    He is playing well on the volley, baseline; he can do big 
                    shots. And Pete, I don't have to describe how he is playing. 
                    I think everybody knows. And he is the greatest, so it will 
                    be in my honour to play against him.<br>
<br>
Q. He has that fantastic forehand, running forehand. Do you 
                    try to stay away from that, or does he try to make you hit 
                    it there and then surprise you he's there, or how do you - 
                    - -<br>
<br>
A. I would have to think about this, about my tactic, and 
                    all these things. I think I will, I will do something, definitely, 
                    that he will not like it.<br>
<br>
Q. Moon balls?<br>

A. I think not. I think you have to move for Pete, and just 
                    play very concentrated and very carefully what you are doing 
                    on the court because, as you know, yeah, he has a big, a huge 
                    forehand, running forehand across court, and definitely the 
                    serve. And when he is on fire you have nothing, basically 
                    nothing to do. But if you stay with him you have a small chance, 
                    so you have to take it. Thank you.<br>
