                  <br>
                  Marat Safin produced a display of power serving to steer Russia 
                  into the Final of the 2002 Davis Cup by BNP Paribas. The Russian 
                  No. 1 sent down 25 aces as he won a rollercoaster four-set encounter 
                  with David Nalbandian 76 67 60 63 to give Russia an unbeatable 
                  3-1 lead over Argentina in their Semifinal tie in Moscow.<br>
<br>
Juan Ignacio Chela then defeated substitute Mikhail Youzhny 
                    76 67 64 in the fifth ‘dead’ rubber to reduce Argentina’s 
                    final deficit to 3-2.<br>
<br>
Twenty-year-old Nalbandian, the hero of Argentina’s historic 
                    doubles victory on Saturday, was brought in as a late replacement 
                    for Gaston Gaudio, who was forced to pull out of the tie or 
                    risk further damage to a left leg injury. <br>
<br>
The Argentine continued where he left off the previous evening, 
                    taking advantage of three Safin errors to break serve in the 
                    third game and build an early 3-1 lead. The Russian produced 
                    a winning forehand return to level at 3-3, and the match progressed 
                    into a tiebreak, where Safin won four of the first five points 
                    and went on to draw first blood 7-3.<br>
<br>
When Nalbandian dropped serve to trail 2-1 in the second 
                    set, the crowd started to anticipate a comfortable victory, 
                    and when Safin produced four aces to lead 4-2, the celebrating 
                    began.<br>
<br>
At this point the Safin of old returned. For the next three 
                    games, forehands and backhands were sprayed to the furthest 
                    reaches of the court as Nalbandian fought back to lead 5-4. 
                    Strong serving kept the Russian in the hunt and he held on 
                    to force a second tiebreak. However a further three aces weren’t 
                    enough to compensate for further errors and the Argentine 
                    levelled the match 7-5 with an audacious backhand dropshot 
                    winner.<br>
<br>
At the changeover Safin picked up a warning for racket abuse 
                    and a more experienced opponent might have turned the screw. 
                    Unfortunately Nalbandian made two forehand errors to trail 
                    2-0 in the third set, and as the level of his own service 
                    dropped, Safin’s continued to improve. The Russian won eight 
                    games in a row to take the third set 60 and lead 2-0 in the 
                    fourth.<br>
<br>
And so to the final chapter of an absorbing tie. Having missed 
                    a point to lead 3-0, Safin was broken twice to trail 3-2, 
                    only for Nalbandian to drop his own delivery and allow the 
                    Russian to level. Hitting more freely, Safin broke again to 
                    lead 5-3 before a final game which summed up the whole match.<br>
<br>
Three times Safin served an ace to reach match point, three 
                    times an unforced error allowed his opponent to level at deuce. 
                    Another service winner brought a fourth match point, and this 
                    time a forehand drop volley winner sent the Russian supporters 
                    wild.<br>
<br>
Afterwards the Russian admitted that he was exhausted by 
                    the efforts of the weekend. “We should have finished the tie 
                    yesterday, but we couldn’t find our game and luck wasn’t with 
                    us. Afterwards I felt I had no energy left. Today I was really 
                    nervous and at one stage I didn’t think I would be able to 
                    finish the match. I am very happy to have won.”<br>
<br>
A disappointed Nalbandian said: “I gave everything on court, 
                    and kept trying to fight back, but it wasn’t enough. Marat 
                    played really well and won many points with his serve. I think 
                    that was the main difference today.”<br>
<br>
Despite the defeat, Argentine captain Alejandro Gattiker 
                    was full of praise for his young squad. “We knew we had a 
                    competitive team, but we lost against a great team. I am not 
                    happy with the result, but I am happy with the way my players 
                    reacted and played a great match on what is not our best surface. 
                    We have a lot of young players in the world’s top 50, so our 
                    Davis Cup future looks good.”<br>
<br>
Russia now faces defending champion France in the Final, 
                    and will be forced to play away for the first time this year. 
                    Underplaying Russia’s chances, Safin said: “It’s going to 
                    be really tough. The French team can play on any surface and 
                    have many different players they can use. However we don’t 
                    have anything to lose, and if we are confident, who knows 
                    what can happen.”<br>
<br>
“In 2000 Yevgeny and I weren’t playing well and we were defeated 
                    by Spain. In 2001 I had a back injury when we lost to Sweden. 
                    This year everything fits, so we must convert our chance.”<br>
