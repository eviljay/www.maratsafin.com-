                    <b>MODERATOR:</b> 
                    Questions for Marat.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>You said that the guy, whoever starts fast, is going 
                    to win that match. You didn't start very fast. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I wasn't right (smiling). Next time don't 
                    believe me. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> We always believe you. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No, sometimes you don't have to. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Kiefer says he thinks you can win this tournament.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, but it's only words. Can you believe 
                    it? It would be nice, I know, but it's long way. Still two 
                    matches, tough opponents, Martin and Johansson, and maybe 
                    in the final I don't want to think about this. I have my next 
                    match. I'm only in the semifinal. I go match by match. It's 
                    better like this. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>What turned it around for you after the first set, 
                    being down 5-2?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Nothing. He wouldn't-couldn't win his 
                    serve. That's it. He make the wrong decisions. Maybe he doesn't 
                    serve so well. Maybe I return a little bit better. I was more 
                    concentrated on his serve because I knew I was very close 
                    to lose this set, so I was a hundred percent concentrated, 
                    and I was lucky. That's it. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>You've had lapses of concentration in the first 
                    three rounds. In the last two, seems like you've pretty much 
                    been all there. What's been the difference?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Nothing. I just found my game. I was afraid 
                    against Grosjean. I was very close to go home very fast. I 
                    said, "Please, no, don't do this again. Just make your game, 
                    win fast and go home." You can be in the five sets, tiebreak. 
                    First of all, you lose a lot of years on this game. You can 
                    come completely white. Also the confidence is going because 
                    if you win two sets, like I was against Grosjean, after you 
                    lose other two very easy, you can't find your game. It also 
                    is not nice and not good for your game. I decide to play my 
                    game as fast as I can. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> You've been talking through the year about being 
                    afraid of certain players, being afraid of certain moments 
                    in a match. Are you getting to that point yet where you're 
                    not afraid of who you play, whatever the situation is? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>I think you have to be afraid, otherwise 
                    you going to the court, you think that you have to win. These 
                    other guys, they're playing great tennis, like Kiefer. If 
                    you go to the court and you are not afraid, he can beat you 
                    very easy because he's playing great tennis. You're going 
                    there, you know, "I'm going to beat this guy very easy." I 
                    was almost could be three-sets-to-Love very easy, so you have 
                    to be afraid - a little bit, not too much. A little bit, yes, 
                    but before the match. It give you a little bit of concentration. 
                    You have to move a lot, otherwise if you are a hundred percent 
                    sure that you going to win, you don't move at all. Then the 
                    problems coming, like against Grosjean. I came, I win two 
                    sets. I don't know where I've been the other two. I was in 
                    the locker room, I think. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Is there a way of keeping yourself from being overconfident?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, but sometimes is good, sometimes 
                    no. But normally, it doesn't work. You have to be afraid every 
                    time you going to the court. It gives you, you know, motivation, 
                    adrenaline is going to your body. Otherwise you go to the 
                    court like to the beach. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Is it more satisfying or exciting at this point 
                    to be in the semis of a Grand Slam? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Not the first one, not the second one. 
                    Just semifinal. I'm in the way to be in the final. I don't 
                    think about. Semifinal is not enough, definitely. It's never 
                    enough, believe me. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>What do you know about the next two opponents? Do 
                    you have a preference on which one you'd rather play, Martin 
                    or Johansson? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> It doesn't matter. Both, they are playing 
                    great tennis, if they pass four rounds each one. Martin was 
                    match point down. He win. He can play. He very talented guy. 
                    He can play till 12:00 in the morning. I can't do it. He's 
                    a big fighter, has a good serve. It's difficult to play against 
                    him. Thomas, he's in a good shape. He couldn't do it during 
                    all the year. He was playing very bad because he finished 
                    the year like 115, now he's 70. So he's coming back with his 
                    confidence. He going to give everything to be in the final, 
                    to get his old ranking, to be in the Top 20. But with Thomas, 
                    at least we can play with the baseline. Then you see if you 
                    can beat him or not. But with Todd, it's a lot of headache 
                    because he's a big serve, no rhythm at all. He plays very 
                    fast, very good volley. It's a different game, which I don't 
                    like. I prefer to play with Thomas. It's my game. It's more 
                    similar to me. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> We haven't seen you smash a racquet yet. Little 
                    disappointed. Is this a new, more mature Marat Safin, or are 
                    you deciding to take pity on your racquets?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> If you can pay all my fines, it's okay. I 
                    can broke many. You know how much I paid already this year?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Tell us.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Close to probably was 250 in Australia, 
                    close to $7,000, or even 10. Guys, for $10,000, you know what 
                    I can do? You don't want to know what I can do with $10,000.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>How many have you broken this year so far? I know 
                    it was 48 last year. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> You going to go out to Head to tell them, 
                    no? 35, 36.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>When was the last time?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Last time? Last week against Guardiola. 
                    I forgot about this already. I'm a new man. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> In the third set, if you were your coach, you were 
                    down 3-4, down a breakpoint, very important point, he hits 
                    a lob over you, you try a shot between your legs instead of 
                    hitting the lob back. Do you think your coach would be happy, 
                    you not hitting the lob, trying that crazy shot? <br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> If I would be a coach, I will come down to 
                    the court and I would hit with the racquet definitely, to 
                    be so clever. But actually, what you going to do?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Lob.<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: But I thought he was going to the net actually. 
                    If he's going to the net, I was hundred percent that he was 
                    on the net. So if I pass with the lob, there's no chance. 
                    I decided I make the right decision, definitely, to play between 
                    the legs. You know how many words I said to myself that I 
                    was right? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>In the fourth set, you had just broken him to 4-2, 
                    then he hits an overhead, you go climbing the back fence to 
                    get it. Can you talk about that point?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, but I was just trying to fight. 
                    I didn't want to go for the best shot of the day. I was going 
                    for everything. At least he knows that I'm going to fight 
                    until the end, otherwise he can get his confidence back, and 
                    somehow he can make a break. So I don't want to play five 
                    sets anymore. I was going for everything. I was running everywhere. 
                    I was lucky that I catch this ball. The second shot, I think 
                    the sun, the ball was in the sun, so is difficult, he couldn't 
                    smash it. Also from this side, we couldn't serve very well 
                    because the last set, last set and a half, we had sun over 
                    there. You serve and you still have sun everywhere in the 
                    point. So it was difficult to play there. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Could you hear the TV commentators on the court?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No, but I can hear one guy, I don't know 
                    what he was explaining to someone. I don't know, but he was 
                    completely -- I could hear it from other side of the court. 
                    I don't know. I think he enjoyed a lot our game at least.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Could you tell us just a little bit about your three 
                    different coaches you've had this year, what they've added? 
                    I was curious as to what they've added to your year, the three 
                    individual guys.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Sasha, he's sitting there. Ask him if 
                    he's the coach. He's not my coach. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>The three guys you've had helping you. <br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> No, it was -- I had two coaches only. Three 
                    coaches in my life. I have my mother. The coach before I had 
                    for six years. I had Andrei Chesnokov. Now I don't have anybody. 
                    Just him, because he has nothing to do in Russia (laughter).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> About your mother, it's interesting, because obviously 
                    apart from giving birth to you and coaching you, she's also 
                    played a big role here because Elena Dementieva, she was taught 
                    by your mother; is that right? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, she was. I don't know until what 
                    age she was with my mother. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Seven.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Until seven? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> From seven years old. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, I know. From seven, because normally, 
                    the kids, they start to play from six, seven. I think she 
                    was like four years with my mother. So the technique, she 
                    put everything, she gave the base, you know. After she left 
                    to other coach who could travel with her to the tournaments 
                    because my mother, she has my small sister also. She could 
                    not travel, so it was a little bit difficult. Elena, she left. 
                    I think it's right decision. I was tired of fighting with 
                    my mother, with my parents, because in all the families is 
                    the same. You fight with your mother, you fight with your 
                    father. So they decide to send me to Spain. But for this I 
                    thank very much to my mother that she put me in the right 
                    way to play tennis, otherwise I could be I don't know who, 
                    but definitely not great sportsman.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Do you remember Elena being there at the same time 
                    when you were there with your mother?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, of course. Play the same times.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> You played together? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Sometimes. She was bad (laughter). <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> How does your mother feel when you throw racquets?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> "Well done. Well done, kid. Do it again."<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Last year you had a lot of off days or bad days. 
                    This year you eliminated them. How did you do that? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I'm one year older and more experience, 
                    I think. I'm getting older. You see my hair is already white. 
                    No, just a little bit more of experience so at least sometimes 
                    I know what I have to do to get out from this situation. That's 
                    it. Experience. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Why do you think that your matches seem so long? 
                    You always seem to have a conversation going on in your head. 
                    Is that why, you're always playing yourself?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> What do you mean, with the long matches? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Yes. You seem to always have a conversation going 
                    on in your own head in your matches. Your matches go on and 
                    on. You try to end them. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Sometimes I'm trying to push myself because 
                    I can play one set, and the next set I don't know what I'm 
                    doing. I need to push myself because otherwise I'm completely 
                    stopped on the court, I'm blocked. At least I'm trying to 
                    push me to move, to get angry, to get into the game. That's 
                    it. Five sets, that's because I get angry in five-set matches. 
                    I'm playing and I'm stopping. I'm playing, I don't know what 
                    I'm doing. These matches, I'm trying to push myself, I'm trying 
                    to hit racquet, to get angry, to get back into the match. 
                    But when I'm playing good, I don't have to do this. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Did you used to watch Goran Ivanisevic? He did a 
                    lot of that in his prime, made it to semifinals. You remind 
                    a lot of us somewhat of him because of the way he was. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> But he's I think the same manager, that 
                    guy in the last row, the same manager. I don't know. I think 
                    he's the same style, more or less, the same parents. I think 
                    Goran, he was like this since the beginning. He didn't become 
                    crazy when he was on ATP. He was already like this when he 
                    was young, the same like me, yes. Yes, I was like this already. 
                    I think it's a question of parents. Normally the father, if 
                    he's a big fighter, normally you become crazy. You smash racquets, 
                    you know, you get crazy on the court like your parents.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>So your parents smashed racquets on the court?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No, my father, he was like this. He was 
                    - how you say - when he play football, he get angry with all 
                    other players. Sometimes he hits Volkov on the head when they're 
                    playing together. I think it's coming from the father. <br>
