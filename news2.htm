                        Second seeds Russia have levelled their tie with the USA 
                        in the Hyundai Hopman Cup teams tennis tournament at Perth's 
                        Burswood Dome.<br>
                        After a 2hr. 20min struggle, world No. 2Marat Safin finally 
                        subdued American Jan-Michael Gambill, 6-4, 6-7, 6-3, with 
                        the tie-breaker going eight points to six after Safin 
                        held a match point at 6-5. After missing that opportunity 
                        the powerful Russian had to work through another tough 
                        set before clinching the rubber on his fourth match point, 
                        which was set up with his 17th ace for the game.<br>
                        Earlier, former world No. 1 tennis player Monica Seles 
                        got her adopted country off to a good start when the United 
                        States of America won the first rubber against second 
                        seeds Russia. Now ranked four, Seles dropped her opening 
                        service game to Elena Likhovtseva and trailed 2-0, but 
                        recovered to win six of the next seven games. She repeated 
                        the scoreline in the second set to wrap up the match, 
                        6-3, 6-3.<br>
                        The mixed doubles will now follow to decide this match, 
                        with the victorious nation looking on target for a finals

                        the new season Monday when he was beaten by Olivier Rochus

                        was beaten by Belgium in the best-of-three tie. Kim Clijsters, 
                        17, had given Belgium a 1-0 lead by defeating Russia's 
                        Elena Likhovtseva 6-1, 6-4.<br>
                        Safin, 20, had not played competitively since losing the 
                        chance to finish last season as world No. 1 at the Masters 
                        Cup in Lisbon in December. The U.S. Open champion took 
                        a 3-1 lead in the deciding set, but Rochus, ranked 67th 
                        in the world, won five games in a row to clinch victory.<br>

                        American Pete Sampras beat Marat Safin, 6-3, 6-2, in Friday's 
                        round-robin play at the season- ending $3.7 million Tennis 
                        Masters Cup at Atlantic Pavilion. <br>
                        Sampras broke Safin's powerful serve on three occasions 
                        in the quick, 1-hour, 3-minute match. Sampras' serve was 
                        not broken by Russian.<br>
                        The third-seeded Sampras won the Red Group this week, 
                        going 2-1 after opening his stay in Lisbon with a straight-set 
                        loss against Australian teenager Lleyton Hewitt.<br>
                        The top-seeded Safin also went 2-1 in the round-robin 
                        portion of the event, as he and Sampras qualified for 
                        Saturday's semifinals at the lucrative tournament. Failing 
                        to advance from the Red Group were Hewitt (1-2) and Spaniard 
                        Alex Corretja (1-2).<br>
                        Sampras is playing his first tennis since losing badly 
                        to Safin in the September 10 U.S. Open final. Since then, 
                        Safin has become the No. 1 player in the world, while 
                        Sampras married actress Bridgette Wilson. Safin and Gustavo 
                        Kuerten are vying for the year-end world No. 1 ranking, 
                        which Safin could have clinched with a victory over Sampras 
                        on Friday. Instead, the currently No. 2 Kuerten is still 
                        alive. "Guga" needs to defeat Yevgeny Kafelnikov on Friday 
                        in order to keep his tournament title and No. 1 aspirations 
                        intact.<br>

                        Marat Safin won the battle of the young guns with a 6-4, 
                        6-4win over Australia's Lleyton Hewitt. Safin was too 
                        strong for Hewitt from the outset, with a single break 
                        of serve deciding matters in the first set. The second 
                        set was closer, with Hewitt showing all the grip and determination 
                        which has made him a fixture in the Champions Race top 
                        ten.<br>
                        Hewitt refused to buckle, running himself ragged to counteract 
                        the raw power of Safin's groundstrokes, but to no avail. 
                        Although Hewitt retrieved a break of serve to fight back 
                        to 4-4 in the second set, Safin stepped up a gear to win 
                        the next two games to take the match and a take the lead 
                        in the Red Group.<br>
                        Hewitt must now defeat Alex Corretja to have any chance 
                        of getting through to the semifinals. Safin plays Pete 
                        Sampras next.<br>
                        The win has also helped Safin's chances of ending the 
                        year in the No.1 spot of the ATP Champions Race. Gustavo 
                        Kuerten is the only man who can stop him now, and would 
                        need to win all his remaining matches in Lisbon to have 
                        any chance of stopping the all-conquering Russian. <br>

                        Battling for the year-end No. 1 ranking, Safin rallied 
                        after being down a set and a break to outduel Spain's 
                        Alex Corretja, 6-7 (6-8), 7-5, 6-3, in today's first round-robin 
                        match at the $3.7 million Tennis Masters Cup. <br>
                        After losing the first set in a tiebreak, Safin found 
                        himself down a break at 2-3 after he double-faulted on 
                        break point. <br>
                        Safin held at 3-5, but that left Corretja serving for 
                        the match at 5-4. The Spaniard was unable to close out 
                        Safin, though, as the Russian broke him at love to level 
                        the set. Safin held for a 6-5 advantage, then broke Corretja 
                        again in the 12th game to force a third set.<br>
                        "My confidence and my concentration were completely gone," 
                        Safin said. "Alex served for the match and suddenly everything 
                        just changed. He just let me play a little bit more and 
                        let me get into the match." <br>
                        With the momentum shifted in Safin's favor, he broke for 
                        a 2-0 lead and held serve the next game to complete a 
                        streak of seven straight games won. He made that one break 
                        stand up as he served out the match in the ninth game 
                        to close out the 2 1/2-hour match and extend his winning 
                        streak to 11 matches. <br>
                        "I was satisfied with my third set after those two horrible 
                        sets," Safin said. "I finally found my game. It gives 
                        me confidence, at least."<br>
                        Participating in his first world championship, Safin is 
                        battling Kuerten for the No. 1 ranking. Regardless of 
                        how others do this week, the 20-year-old Russian only 
                        needs to reach Sunday's final to become the youngest top-ranked 
                        player ever and the first non-American since Sweden's 
                        Stefan Edberg in 1991.<br>
                        "It's enough motivation to play, but it's tough also," 
                        Safin said about playing for the No. 1 ranking. "Everybody 
                        wants to beat you and you have to give all your best on 
                        the court. I would like to finish No. 1 this year. It 
                        would be great." <br>
                        Safin has enjoyed a blockbuster year, winning his first 
                        Grand Slam title at the U.S. Open in convincing fashion 
                        over Sampras and collecting an ATP Tour-leading seven 
                        titles. He is the only player to win two Tennis Masters 
                        Series events (Toronto and Paris) this season.<br>

                        in the next four days. Safin, the current Champions Race

                        the season, when they last met in the Australian Open 
                        title match. The Masters Cup will have to wait to see

                        Wimbledon champion Pete Sampras, No. 1 from 1993 to 1998, 
                        is third in the Champions Race, 147 points behind Safin 
                        and still with a mathematical chance of taking top spot. 
                        <br>
                        The eight players are divided into two groups of four. 
                        Each victory in the round-robin stage earns 20 points 
                        and the top two players in each group go forward to the 
                        semifinals. <br>
                        Andre Agassi, currently eighth in the Champions Race, 
                        was world No. 1 last year.<br>
                        If Safin or Kuerten succeed him this year they will be 
                        the first non-American to take top spot since Sweden's 
                        Stefan Edberg in 1991. <br>
                        The Champions Race was introduced this year to replace 
                        a 12-month rankings system that the ATP Tour felt was 
                        confusing for fans and did not reflect which players were 
                        in form.<br>

                        Marat Safin of Russia enhanced his chances of ending the 
                        year first in the ATP Tour Champions Race with a five-set 
                        victory against Mark Philippoussis of Australia on Sunday 
                        in the finals of the $2.95 million Tennis Masters Series 
                        event. <br>
                        Safin, who is ranked second, outlasted the 13th-seeded 
                        Philippoussis 3-6, 7-6 (9-7), 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (10-8). Each 
                        player powered 22 aces, but Safin won the key points in 
                        the tiebreaks including the final set and Philippoussis 
                        committed nine double faults to just two by Safin. <br>
                        Safin earned 100 points for the victory and doubled his 
                        lead to 40 points against Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil in 
                        the ATP Tour Champions Race 2000 rankings. <br>
                        Safin also earned $434,000 for the tournament victory 
                        a year after finishing second in the same event. He won 
                        his second successive tournament and a circuit-leading 
                        seventh title of the year in nine final appearances. Last 
                        week he captured the St. Petersburg Open for his first 
                        career indoor title and the first in his homeland. <br>

                        Top-seeded Marat Safin and No. 2 Yevgeny Kafelnikov advanced 
                        to the semifinals of the $800,000 St. Petersburg Open 
                        Friday, keeping alive hopes of an all-Russian final. Marat 
                        Safin fstruggled to beat Rainer Schuettler of Germany 
                        6-4, 1-6, 6-3. <br>
                        Safin started slowly against Schuettler and had to fight 
                        to win the first set. In the second set, Safin's game 
                        deserted him completely. The U.S. Open champion repeatedly 
                        hit easy balls long and lost his serve twice.<br>
                        He also lost his cool, hitting a couple of balls into 
                        the rafters in frustration and drawing a warning from 
                        chair umpire Mohammed Lahyany. "I was just so frustrated 
                        and got upset quickly," Safin said. "It felt like my game 
                        was totally gone."<br>
                        Safin is second behind Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten in the 
                        world rankings. But Kuerten lost to Australia's Patrick 
                        Rafter at Lyon, France, on Thursday, meaning Safin would 
                        jump into the lead if he reaches the final at St. Petersburg. 
                        <br>
                        This was little consolation to Safin. "The way I'm playing 
                        right now is not the way a player ranked No. 1 plays," 
                        he said. <br>

                        American Chris Woodruff met Russia's Marat Safin for the 
                        first time in a tennis match Thursday. He may not want 
                        to play him again any time soon. <br>
                        Safin, the No. 1 seed in the St. Petersburg Open, won 
                        the match swiftly and efficiently, disposing of Woodruff 
                        in straight sets, <b>6-3, 6-1</b>, to advance to the quarterfinals. 
                        Safin's victory was impressive in that Woodruff is considered 
                        a formidable opponent on the circuit, even though he has 
                        not won a tournament. <br>
                        The American has reached the quarterfinals four times 
                        this year, including the Australian Open. <br>
                        A semifinalist here last year, the 20-year-old Safin has 
                        a goal to finish the year ranked No. 1 in the world. He 
                        trails French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten by three points 
                        in the ATP Champions Race.<br>
                        Safin admitted on Wednesday he is thinking about the Champions 
                        Race and pays close attention to Kuerten's results.<br>
                        "Of course I follow what Kuerten does," he said. "It's 
                        very exciting. We're all human. Every morning, I'm sure 
                        he reads the newspapers. I do too. I won't lie to you. 
                        I think it's about who gets scared first -- or who can 
                        hold on the longest. I'm holding on strong." <br>

                        U.S. Open champion Marat Safin of Russia today took a 
                        first step toward finishing the year ranked No. 1 in the 
                        world.<br>
                        Safin, who trails French Open champion Gustavo Kuerten 
                        by three points in the ATP Champions Race, posted a 7-6 
                        (9-7), 6-1 victory over fellow Russian Igor Kornienko 
                        in the first round of the $800,000 St. Petersburg Open 
                        indoor tennis tournament.<br>
                        The top seed Safin is getting another chance to win in 
                        his home country. A semifinalist here last year, he lost 
                        to David Prinosil in the semifinals of the Kremlin Cup 
                        in his native Moscow two weeks ago.<br>
                        Safin admitted he is thinking abot the Champions Race 
                        and pays close attention To Kuerten's results.<br>
                        "Of course I follow what Kuerten does," he said. "It's 
                        very exciting. We're all human. Every morning, I'm sure

                        The 20-year-old Safin lost last week in the third round 
                        at the Tennis Masters Series event in Stuttgart. He has 
                        won five titles this season and is tied for the ATP Tour 
                        lead with Sweden's Magnus Norman and Spain's Alex Corretja. 
                        <br>
                        Today, Safin got a test from his unheralded opponent, 
                        but cruised after surviving the tiebreaker in the first 
                        set. "It wasn't unexpected," Safin said. "He was concentrating 
                        in the first set and when he was serving, I couldn't break 
                        him. Then his concentration dropped in the second set. 
                        But even people ranked not so high, they're still good 
                        tennis players." <br>

                          Magazine (November 2000 issue). There is an extensive 
                          article about Marat Safin. <br>
                          ... 'It's a bit humbling to have someone play that well, 
                          for that long,' the five-time U.S. Open champ, Sampras, 
                          said. <br>
                          'He's going to win many major titles.'<br>
                          That first major title officially landed Safin as a 
                          household name among tennis watchers the world over. 
                          And he arrived there through some high 'ups' and low 
                          'downs,' from breaking 48 racquets in anger in 1999 
                          to almost overnight changing his mindset to win the 
                          Barcelona title this spring...<br>

                        Top-seeded Marat Safin finally beat Fabrice Santoro, downing 
                        the Frenchman 6-2, 6-4 on Wednesday to reach the third 
                        round of the Stuttgart Masters Series.<br>
                        ``I didn't look at him, because when you look at him, 
                        you forget to play tennis, for sure,'' Safin said. ``This 
                        is the only player who can drive me crazy on the court 
                        -- like he's done already for two years.''<br>
                        Safin won the last four games to take the first set. He 
                        dropped his serve in the third game of the second set, 
                        but broke back in the next. He broke Santoro with a backhand 
                        winner to win the match. ``I just tried to convince myself 
                        that I have enough of a game and enough power to beat 
                        him,'' Safin said. ``I have everything, it was just a 
                        mental problem.'' ``I was really scared at the beginning 
                        of the match,'' he added. ``My serve in the first game 
                        didn't work. I couldn't run. I was very, very nervous.'' 
                        <br>
                        The 20-year-old Russian had never beaten Santoro in their 
                        five previous matches, with Santoro winning all three 
                        meetings this year, most recently at the Sydney Olympics. 
                        <br>
                        Safin has won a tour-high five titles this year, including

                        Russian Marat Safin, who has won the U.S. Open but never 
                        a Russian pro tournament, downed Vladimir Voltchkov of 
                        Belarus 7-6 (5), 6-1 Friday in the $2 million Kremlin 
                        Cup.<br>
                        The necessity for tiebreaker in the first set made it

                        cruised in the second set.<br>
                        "He lost his concentration, while I was playing better," 
                        said Safin, who fired 16 aces in the second-round match.<br>
                        Safin's semifinal opponent will be German David Prinosil,

                        U.S. Open champion Marat Safin has earned world-wide acclaim 
                        with his play this year. Now, the 20-year-old Safin has 
                        earned a contract with a pivotal player on the world wide 
                        web. The leading Russian-language Internet portal www.Port.ru, 
                        announced today it has reached a multi-year agreement 
                        to sponsor Safin.<br>
                        "I'm pleased to join the leader in Russia's most dynamic 
                        and progressive business sector," Safin said.<br>
                        "I hope our relationship can expand an awareness of tennis 
                        in Russia through the Internet and provide another way 
                        for Russian fans to follow the sport."<br>
                        The contract calls for Safin to promote the company on 
                        and off the court. During this week's Kremlin Cup in Moscow, 
                        Safin will sport a Port.ru patch on his sleeve and he 
                        will speak today at a press conference for the company. 
                        In addition, Safin will make appearances at www.Port.ru
