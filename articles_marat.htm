                    September 16, 2000 TASHKENT, UZBEKISTAN <br>
                    <br>
                    U.S. Open champion Marat Safin claims he is not playing his 
                    best tennis this week at the President's Cup tennis event. 
                    Don't tell George Bastl that. <br>
                    <br>
                    Safin extended his winning streak to 11 matches today by dumping 
                    the 1999 runner-up from Switzerland, 6-2, 6-2, to advance 
                    to the final of the $525,000 hardcourt event. <br>
                    <br>
                    Seeded second, Safin will seek an ATP Tour-leading fifth title 
                    of the year when he meets unseeded Davide Sanguinetti of Italy 
                    in Sunday's final. <br>
                    <br>
                    Sanguinetti, who upset top seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the 
                    second round, will get a chance to eliminate the No. 1 Russian 
                    player in the final after struggling past Frenchman Julien 
                    Boutter, 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-4). <br>
                    <br>
                    Safin has won 23 of his last 25 matches, capturing his first 
                    Tennis Masters Series event in Toronto and first career Grand 
                    Slam at the U.S. Open last week. His straight-sets win over 
                    Pete Sampras on Sunday put him third on the ATP Champions 
                    Race 2000 leaderboard and No. 2 on the entry system rankings. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Despite suffering from jet lag, Safin has dropped only one 
                    set en route to the final.<br>
                    <br>
                    "I still cannot find my game," said Safin, who will vie for 
                    his sixth career title on Sunday. "Of course I'm not very 
                    fresh. But I'm fit enough to do that (win the title). I'm 
                    looking to be No. 1 and I want to be there."<br>
                    <br>
                    After Sunday's final, the 20-year-old Safin will travel to 
                    Sydney, Australia to play singles and doubles at the Olympics. 
                    He is the top seed in the men's draw. <br>
                    <br>
                    Sanguinetti has been a fixture on the Challenger circuit this 
                    season, winning in Ecuador. On the ATP Tour, the 28-year-old's 
                    best showing prior to this week was the semifinals at the 
                    Stella Artois Championships in June. <br>
                    <br>
                    This will be Sanguinetti's second appearance in an ATP Tour 
                    final. He was runner-up at Coral Springs, Florida in 1998. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This will be the first meeting between the two finalists.

                    Sept 16 2000 (Reuters)<br>
                    <br>
                    Marat Safin was sublime in beating Pete Sampras for the U.S. 
                    Open tennis title this month, but rival Magnus Norman believes 
                    the Russian will fall flat in the Olympic tournament.<br>
                    <br>
                    Norman, seeded third in the chase for gold that begins on 
                    Tuesday, predicted that the top-seeded Safin's hectic schedule 
                    would keep him from producing his top form. <br>
                    <br>
                    While many competitors in the 64-player singles field were 
                    already out on Olympic Park practice courts, Safin was still 
                    in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, where on Friday he reached the semifinals 
                    of the President's Cup.<br>
                    <br>
                    "I don't think he is going to be a big threat," the 24-year-old 
                    Swede said Saturday after practice on centre court. "Traveling 
                    from Tashkent will be very difficult.<br>
                    <br>
                    "If I had to do that, I'm sure I'd feel terribly tired and 
                    weaker."<br>
                    <br>
                    Downplaying Safin's chances in Sydney does not mean Norman 
                    underestimates the ability of the Russian, who made the great 
                    Sampras look sadly outclassed in an overwhelming straight 
                    sets victory in the Open final. <br>
                    <br>
                    "I believe he's been playing great tennis for a long time 
                    and he is a very good player," said Norman, winner of three 
                    titles this year and a runner-up this season at the French 
                    Open. "I think I'm going to see a lot of him for the next 
                    few years."<br>
                    <br>
                    Norman said that, besides getting better organized, the 20-year-old 
                    Safin needed to mature and curb a temper that has led him 
                    to destroy as many as 50 racquets in a season. <br>
                    <br>
                    "He still has to improve his head," said Norman. "He crushes 
                    too many racquets." </font><br>
