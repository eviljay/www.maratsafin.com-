                  <blockquote> <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Russia 
                    look for new Kournikova in 13-year-old Safina</b> <br>
                      <br>
                      MOSCOW, Feb 28 2000 <br>
                      <br>
                      She is just 13 years old but stands 178 cm (5ft 10 ins) 
                      and hits the ball at well over 120 kph (75 mph). She is 
                      Dinara Safina, the younger sister of Russian Davis Cup player 
                      Marat Safin. <br>
                      <br>
                      After recently winning two prestigious tournaments for up 
                      to 14-year-olds back-to-back in Telford, England and Tarbes, 
                      France Safina became Europe's top ranked player in her age 
                      group. <br>
                      <br>
                      She is coached by her mother, Rauza Islanova, who was a 
                      top player in the former Soviet Union in the 1970s.<br>
                      <br>
                      Already many Russians are talking of the youngster as the 
                      next Anna Kournikova. Agents and managers are also lurking 
                      in the background, waiting to sign the promising youngster.<br>
                      <br>
                      "Dinara is a very talented young player, probably the most 
                      talented to come out of Russia in a very long time," said 
                      Russia Davis Cup captain Shamil Tarpishchev, who used to 
                      play mixed doubles with Islanova in their glory days.<br>
                      <br>
                      "One thing is for sure, she has already achieved more than 
                      Marat at the same age." People who know her well also point 
                      to Safina's attitude. When asked a couple of years ago if 
                      she wanted to emulate Kournikova, she told stunned reporters: 
                      "No, because she hasn't won anything yet." <br>
                      <br>
                      NO REAL HEROES <br>
                      <br>
                      Safina, who turns 14 in April, said that while she admires 
                      Wimbledon and Australian Open champion Lindsay Davenport, 
                      she still does not have any real tennis heroes. "I just 
                      want to be myself," she told Reuters.<br>
                      <br>
                      "Obviously, I want to win all the tournaments where I play, 
                      but whatever the outcome, I enjoy playing tennis." And does 
                      she ever ask her big brother for advice?<br>
                      <br>
                      "No, my mother's advice is good enough for me right now," 
                      she said. <br>
                      <br>
                      Safina and her mother have had a busy schedule for the last 
                      couple of years. When not playing in a tournament, they 
                      commute between Moscow and Valencia, where the family also 
                      have a house. <br>
                      <br>
                      In Moscow, she works twice a day under the watchful eye 
                      of her mother in a youth tennis academy. <br>
                      <br>
                      Tennis, however, has seen its share of promising young players 
                      such as Jennifer Capriati who had too much too soon and 
                      were burned out at an early age. <br>
                      <br>
                      "Actually, I've been doing just the opposite, I'm holding 
                      her back a little bit," said Islanova.<br>
                      "We don't want to pit her against 18-year-olds all of a 
                      sudden, where she would start losing her matches all the 
                      time. <br>
                      <br>
                      It's a gradual process of working your way up." <br>
                      <br>
                      However, Safina will no longer be playing against her own 
                      age group.<br>
                      <br>
                      "After she won both the singles and doubles in Telford as 
                      well as in Tarbes, I don't think there is any point in doing 
                      it any more," her mother said. <br>
                      <br>
                      "Now, we'll be looking into some good under-16 tournaments 
                      where she can again prove herself." <br>
                      <br>
                      NOT ONLY BETTER BUT BIGGER <br>
                      <br>
                      "The problem is that she is not only better but she is bigger 
                      than most of the girls in her age group and she is still 
                      growing pretty fast," Islanova added. <br>
                      <br>
                      "That's why we have to be careful of injuries, particularly 
                      her knees which are not used to wear and tear at this age." 
                      <br>
                      <br>
                      Another problem for Safina is trying to juggle her tennis 
                      and school-work. "Well, now you can take correspondence 
                      courses and just go to school to take exams," Islanova said.<br>
                      <br>
                      "The good thing is that most teachers are understanding. 
                      They are a bit easier on her than on most other kids," she 
                      added. <br>
                      <br>
                      "And that's the way it should be done, because most likely, 
                      Dinara will never need a huge amount of chemistry, physics, 
                      and mathematics and make a career out of it.<br>
                      <br>
                      "I just want her to be a well educated and cultivated person 
                      and to enjoy her life." <br>
                      <br>
                      <br>
