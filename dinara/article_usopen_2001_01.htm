                    Sister Carrying On Family Tradition</b><br>
                      <br>
                      Tuesday, September 4, 2001<br>
                      by Erik Boland<br>
                      <br>
                      Dinara Safina answers the questions amicably enough, but 
                      it's obvious she's answered them before. She would be happy 
                      if she didn't have to answer them again, but that seems 
                      unlikely, at least in the near future.<br>
                      <br>
                      Safina, the 15-year-old sister of 2000 US Open champion 
                      Marat Safin, is trying to establish her own tennis identity. 
                      However, having a superstar for an older brother, one who 
                      is recognized worldwide and is a headliner at whatever tournaments 
                      he plays, makes her task difficult. Safina won her first 
                      round ITF juniors match Tuesday over Ana Vrijic but her 
                      post-match press conference followed an all-too-familiar 
                      theme. Namely, what is it like having an international tennis 
                      star for a brother?<br>
                      <br>
                      &quot;It is difficult,&quot; said Safina, a native Russian 
                      but current resident of Spain who speaks English, Spanish 
                      and Russian. &quot;Yes, I would like to be known for myself. 
                      Everyone always starts by saying, 'You're his sister, you're 
                      his sister.' But, I'm just his sister.&quot;<br>
                      <br>
                      Safina is the No. 15 seed in the US Open juniors tournament 
                      but in the past she has had to rely on wild card invitations 
                      for some tournaments. In the eyes of some tennis cynics, 
                      that created some new questions, but still ones with sibling 
                      overtones.<br>
                      <br>
                      &quot;Everyone would be like, 'You're his [Marat's] sister. 
                      You got the wild card because you're his sister.' I don't 
                      like that.&quot;<br>
                      <br>
                      This year Dinara's game has helped her end those types of 
                      questions. Safina finished as the runner-up in this year's 
                      Wimbledon junior championship and, with Tuesday's victory, 
                      moved to 29-3 in singles in 2001. Currently, Safina is the 
                      11th-ranked junior singles player in the world.<br>
                      <br>
                      In Tuesday's match, Safina, after winning the first set 
                      6-2, found herself trailing 5-1 in the second. Rediscovering 
                      her powerful serve and striking several key winners for 
                      break points, Safina rallied to send the set into a tie-breaker. 
                      She controlled the tie-breaker 7-2.<br>
                      <br>
                      &quot;I was down 5-1 and I was like to myself, 'What are 
                      you doing?'&quot; Safina said. &quot;I was a little lucky.&quot;<br>
                      <br>
                      Dinara said she is close to her brother but he rarely comes 
                      to see her play. Marat knows that by coming to one of her 
                      matches, the few people who are there will spend more time 
                      watching him than his sister.<br>
                      <br>
                      &quot;He doesn't like to watch because it might hurt my 
                      concentration,&quot; she said.<br>
                      <br>
                      Dinara is paying close attention to her brother as he tries 
                      to defend his Open title. She watched Marat's four-set, 
                      fourth-round victory over Thomas Johansson from her hotel 
                      room Monday evening, even though it ran late and she had 
                      to play early Tuesday.<br>
                      <br>
                      &quot;I was watching it as it got to the fourth set,&quot; 
                      she said. &quot;I had to get to sleep and it was like, 'Oh, 
                      one more game, one more game.'&quot;<br>
                      <br>
                      Safina said her game is a work in progress and there are 
                      not too many parallels between her style of play and her 
                      brother's. She did admit to sharing some of Marat's famous 
                      temper, but proudly pointed out, &quot;I've only broken 
                      one racket all my life.&quot; This is one of what Dinara 
                      hopes will be many distinctions between her and Marat in 
                      the coming years.<br>
