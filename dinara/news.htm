                       Roehampton, UK</b><br>
                        Two hours after missing out on a place at Wimbledon, Dinara 
                        Safina could not stop crying. The 16-year-old sister of 
                        Marat Safin, the No 2 seed in the men’s championship, 
                        idly dipped a chip in a pool of tomato ketchup and smeared 
                        it around her plate. She barely had the stomach to eat 
                        it. <br>
                        Safina had lost 4-6, 6-2, 8-6 in heart-wrenching circumstances 
                        against Zuzani Ondraskova in the final round of qualifying 
                        at Roehampton. The opportunity of appearing in her first 
                        grand-slam tournament had slipped away. It was particularly 
                        galling because she had served for the match at 5-3 and 
                        then squandered a match point at 6-5. Failing so narrowly 
                        is hard to bear, whatever the stage of your career. <br>
                        “It’s so tough,” Safina, who was runner-up at Wimbledon 
                        in the junior event last year, said. “It was the same 
                        last week in Tashkent. I lost again having had match point. 
                        I really wanted to play at Wimbledon. I would not have 
                        minded if I had lost two and two. But when I was serving 
                        for the match I started to make unnecessary mistakes. 
                        I had everything in my favour but, to be fair, she (Ondraskova) 
                        played a great match, but I should have won.” <br>
                        It was of little consolation that Rausa, her mother, who 
                        was Safin’s coach as a boy, told her that she would learn 
                        from the experience. Safina was 16 only in April but, 
                        like so many girls from Russia and the former Eastern 
                        bloc on the circuit, she is driven by the desire to succeed. 
                        Winning equals status, equals prosperity. The equation 
                        is simple. <br>
                        Safin, the US Open champion in 2000 and a Wimbledon quarter-finalist 
                        last year, has been an inspiration and also her patron. 
                        His financial support pays for his sister and her coach 
                        to travel the world from their base in Valencia. Being 
                        on the road is expensive, but Safin’s generosity ensures 
                        that she can stay in decent hotels, enabling her to concentrate 
                        on tennis. “I am lucky to have Marat. But I don’t want 
                        him to sponsor me for ever,” she said.<br>
                        “I want to succeed on my own and earn my own money, maybe 
                        even pay him back. I also want to play mixed doubles with 
                        him at Wimbledon.” <br>
                        She took up tennis at the age of seven, Misha, her father, 
                        being the director of a small tennis club in Moscow. In 
                        theory, she is still supposed to be studying at school, 
                        but education has taken a back seat. She returns home 
                        today to prepare for her next tournament in Casablanca 
                        in two weeks’ time. “My ambition is to win my next match. 
                        To succeed you have to fight for every chance.” Will she 
                        be back? “Of course,” she said, at last allowing herself 
                        a flicker of a smile.<br>

                        at the Estoril WTA event on Friday increasing the possibility 
                        that the two singles titles on Sunday will be claimed 
                        by the same family.<br>
The 15-year-old booked her place in the last four beating 
                          Slovenia's Maja Matevzic 6-0, 7-5.<br>
Later on Friday, big brother Marat, seeded two, could

&quot;It's fantastic to have done so well,&quot; said 
                          Safina.<br>
&quot;Before this event, I thought it would be good

                        Russian teen Dinara Safina makes her WTA Tour main draw 
                        debut Monday against third seed Martina Sucha of Slovakia 
                        in the first round of the $665,000 Estoril Open.<br>
                        Safina is the younger sister of ATP Tour star Marat Safin 
                        and is coached by their mother, Rausa Islanova. Like her 
                        brother, Dinara possesses a big serve, heavy groundstrokes 
                        and a volatile temperament.<br>
                        The 15-year-old from Moscow had a strong junior career, 
                        highlighted by a runner-up showing in the girls' singles 
                        at Wimbledon in 2001.<br>
                        Safina finished in the top 20 in the world junior rankings 
                        last year and was the runner-up in the girls' doubles 
                        at the 2001 French Open. <br>
                        Earlier this year, Safina won two singles titles and a 
                        doubles crown in a pair of International Tennis Federation

                          Dinara Safina was forced to dig deep during the Girls' 
                          Singles Final and, in so doing, showed that she could 
                          adopt a more subtle approach than simply power although 
                          that remains her game's trademark.<br>
                          Unfortunately for the 15-year-old Russian, she was unable 
                          to contain the more consistent and varied play of her 
                          opponent, Angelique Widjaja of Indonesia, 16, who collected 
                          her first Junior Grand Slam title with a 6-4 0-6 7-5 
                          victory.<br>
                          Trailing 3-2 when rain suspended play on Saturday, Widjaja, 
                          the No. 8 seed, returned to the fray with a better game 
                          plan. With some clever play, no pace and sheer consistency, 
                          she gained the advantage in the ninth game when a flustered 
                          Safina delivered two double faults to concede her serve.<br>
                          It was then a simple matter of serving out, a feat that 
                          Widjaja achieved comfortably to love to take a set lead.<br>
                          Dropping that set, only her second of the week, spurred 
                          Safina, the No. 15 seed, to new heights of purpose. 
                          Adopting much the same tactics as her opponent, she 
                          quickly turned the tables to level at one set all 18 
                          minutes later.<br>
                          The contest settled somewhat during the decider as Safina 
                          reverted to type, blasting her ground strokes. It was 
                          not surprising, therefore, to find Widjaja gaining the 
                          ascendancy as she followed the same tactics as the first 
                          set.<br>
                        The result was a break in the seventh game, leaving Safina 
                        with plenty of hard work to do to save the match. She 
                        recovered with some sensible play to break back when Widjaja 
                        first served for the title. But then she failed to hold 
                        her own serve and hung her head when the Indonesian achieved 
                        her winning objective second time around with a low cross 
                        court volley.</font></td>

                          the full weight of the Safina power as she was overwhelmed

                          sets in the Girls' Singles Semi-Finals. <br>
                          It was a hard-hitting exchange between the two youngsters 
                          who prefer to play the game from behind the baseline

                          seemed able to match her six-foot Russian opponent.<br>
                          They exchanged breaks in the early part of the match 
                          but then the Safina power took over as she blasted her

                          to win the first set 6-2 and take a 4-0 lead in the 
                          second.<br>
                        Keothavong prevented a second set whitewash when she hit 
                        back to break 15th seed Safina in the fifth game but it 
                        was all too late as she slumped to a 6-2 6-1 defeat.</font></td>

                          Men's Quarter-Finalist Marat Safin's baby sister, Dinara, 
                          required 61 minutes to reach the Semi-Finals of the 
                          Girls' Singles but her passage wasn't as smooth as expected. 
                          Her opponent, Daniela Casanova, suddenly found her range 
                          to hold her up during the latter part of the second 
                          set.<br>
                          From the start it was Safina who dictated, breaking 
                          her Swiss opponent in the second game on her third break 
                          point. It was disastrous five-deuce game for Casanova 
                          who failed to hang on to her serve on the three game 
                          points she had.<br>
                          She did level three games later only to falter again 
                          under Russian pressure to go 5-4 down and, despite her 
                          frantic efforts in the next game, was forced to concede 
                          the set.<br>
                          The second set was evenly balanced as Casanova found 
                          her accuracy and length and gained in confidence to 
                          such an extent that she made the initial break to love 
                          for a 5-3 lead but then failed to capitalise on it as 
                          the long-legged Safina came storming back to earn a 
                          Semi-Final place against British girl Anne Keothavong.<br>
                          During the match the 15-year-old Safina showed a tendency 
                          for racket-throwing, much in the manner of her brother. 
                          &quot;I never break them,&quot; she said, &quot;but 
                          I do throw them when I am angry. It's good to be like 
                          my brother, he has won the US Open and been world No. 
                          1.&quot;<br>
                        Safina, the No. 15 seed, is one of three Russians to have 
                        made the last eight of the competition. &quot;We have 
                        lots of good girls because we have good coaches,&quot; 
                        she said, giving reasons for her country's rising success. 
                        &quot;We play a lot of team events and always meet up 
                        a week before to be coached before the competition.&quot;</font></td>

                        to 4-1. The Russian quickly finished it off by taking
