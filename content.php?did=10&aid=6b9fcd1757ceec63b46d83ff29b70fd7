But really, Roland Garros was my first "real" tournament where my career began. After RG 1998, I first stepped into the top 100. I came through qualifying, beat Agassi, Kuerten (defending champion) and then lost to Pioline in a match I could have won. Later, I went to the quarters (2000) and semi final (2002), I was not far from the victory. Unfortunately, that seems to be far today.<BR>And it’s going to be even more difficult for me to win the tournament.<BR></FONT></STRONG><BR><STRONG><FONT color=#ff812b><I>E: Is Roland Garros still your favorite tournament?</I><BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#acac2b>M: Absolutely. I love <?xml:namespace prefix = st1 ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags" /><st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Paris</st1:place></st1:City>, I like the crowd, the courts, the atmosphere…People have always been great with me, whether I play good or bad tennis, they still support me. I’m not that young anymore, I’ve got to enjoy these moments. I like going to Roland Garros. But it’s better to be there, having won matches and pass the first week. But now, it’s harder than years ago. When I went to the semi final in 2002, Federer didn’t play that well on clay, Nadal was not even here! And I don’t even talk about the new generation, Djokovic, Gasquet, Berdych, etc.</FONT><BR><BR><FONT color=#ff812b><I>E: What’s the most difficult thing at Roland Garros?</I><BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#acac2b>M: A lot of things depend on the draw. With a good draw, you can hope to play the second week there. And then, everything is possible: you are more confident, you can play your best tennis and you start to be dangerous.<BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#ff812b><I>E: Your first stay here dates from 1997. You lost in the first round of the junior Roland Garros. What do you remember of that period?</I><BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#acac2b>M: It was tough for me at this stage. I didn’t have money. My sponsor left me. I stayed in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Moscow</st1:place></st1:City> for two months…I thought my career was finished before it started. I asked big companies like IMG or Octagon to help me and give me some money. The agents came to the first round to see how I played and they left saying “ this guy really has nothing special…”. Finally, IMG gave me $5000. And then it all started…<BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#ff812b><I>E: Did you immediately like it?</I><BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#acac2b>M: Of course! You meet all the great players, that gives you some motivation and you understand all the sacrifices you have to make to play at their level and be a pro tennis player.<BR>One year later, I played the “real” tournament. For me, they’re as different as chalk and cheese. Can you imagine? In 1998, I beat Agassi on the Suzanne – Lenglen court and Kuerten on the centre court…What a change in one year! My priorities changed, I didn’t see life as I used to…<BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#ff812b><I>E: How was Marat Safin at this time?</I><BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#acac2b>M: (He smiles) Young. I had no worries. I didn’t know anything…But it was a fantastic period: I only had to care about my tennis. Life was cool. I did a lot of mistakes…Today, I still wonder how I could act this way and do such things…When I think about it, I blush! (laugh) But I had fun, I had a beautiful life…At this time, all I wanted was to buy a car and an apartment. Obviously, I first bought a car…It was a Volkswagen, I remember I bought it for $1500. But it was nice to be young, and to start to earn money…<BR><BR></FONT><FONT color=#ff812b><I>E: Do you regret this period?</I><BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#acac2b>M: Yes, I miss this life because I know it won’t happen again. When you grow up, you start to care about your future. But life it’s also the present! True or not, good or bad, it doesn’t matter. It is experience. <BR>Some say that only the fools do not learn from their errors. That’s stupid: life is too short, there is enough time to make mistakes! We spend your life making mistakes! But it’s cool! At least, you enjoy life and have good times! Why should we take it all seriously?<BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#ff812b><I>E: Let’s go back to Roland Garros. What did you miss in 2000 and 2002 to win the title?</I><BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#acac2b>M: In 2000, in the quarters against Magnus Norman, I had a chance but lost it at the end of the fourth set. He was tired, he started to be nervous, the match was slipping through his fingers. But I missed two break points…This year, I played great tennis. I won <st1:City w:st="on">Barcelona</st1:City>, Mallorca, reached <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Hamburg</st1:place></st1:State> and World Team Cup’s finals. I was probably a bit too tired to go further. Great moment, anyway…In 2002, it was awful. I reached<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>the semis without playing good tennis, I had no coach, I felt lonely. I didn’t enjoy my tennis. All kinds of things could put me into a bad mood…The worse thing is that if I had beaten Ferrero, I would have played Costa in the final and his game didn’t give me any problems. This is the big regret of my career.<BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#ff812b><I>E: For the French crowd, one of your unforgettable matches at Roland Garros is your defeat against Fabrice Santoro in 2001…</I><BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#acac2b>M: (he grimaces a bit) I couldn’t play against Fabrice. It was a mental problem. It all started when I first played him (defeated 6/0 6/4 in <st1:State w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Washington</st1:place></st1:State> in 1999). I still don’t know what happened. Then, I lost some matches against him, simply because I could never beat him. It wasn’t because of his game but - he knew he was mentally stronger. That is what happened that day; since the first game, he understood I wasn’t at ease. He is a clever man, he started to play his game. It drove me crazy but it was my fault not his.<BR></FONT><BR><I><FONT color=#ff812b>E: Three years later, in a match against Mantilla, you dropped your pants down…</FONT></I><BR><BR><FONT color=#acac2b>M: Yes, but it wasn’t hysteria! On the contrary! This match was incredible; we both played<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>super tennis. In the fifth set, we played a hard and fantastic point when I suddenly hit a perfect drop shot. I ran without much belief in it and I succeeded with a passing shot with a nice angle. This point was so amazing that I just dropped my pants down! Like that, without thinking! I grew up in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Spain</st1:place></st1:country-region> and there, it was a tradition: when we played a great point, we dropped down our pants. At Roland Garros, some people didn’t understand but it I didn’t mind. I paid a $2000 fine but it was worth it!(laugh).<BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#ff812b><I>E: This is surely not the only fine you have <SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>had to pay in <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Paris</st1:place></st1:City>: three times you refused to go to the press conferences…</I><BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#acac2b>M: Yes, after my defeats against Hrbaty(1999), Santoro and Gonzales (last year). Every time it was stupid defeats in which I played stupid tennis. I know how it goes: they always ask this stupid question: “Marat, what happened today?” I refuse to answer those questions. This is typical from some journalists: “And why that? Why this?” They push you until you say foolish comments. I don’t regret my quotes but when I’m in a bad mood, it is better to stay quiet.<BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#ff812b><I>E: When you lost to Pioline in 1998, you couldn’t avoid the French crowd’s pressure. Did you progressively start to like the Parisian crowd?</I><BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#acac2b>M: It’s a great crowd. You know, there are places where people don’t understand tennis. In <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">France</st1:place></st1:country-region>, they respect players and understand the game. They don’t push you down even if you play badly. In fact, they let you play your game and do what you want on court. I have played in Bercy, Lyon, <st1:City w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Pau</st1:place></st1:City> , etc…and it’s always the same. The big quality of the French crowd is that they respect the players.<BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#ff812b><I>E: Some players don’t like the centre court. Is it the same for you?</I><BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#acac2b>M: No, the only court I don’t like, is the Suzanne-Lenglen. It is too narrow. In contrast to this court, the centre court is perfect for me. But what I like the most on court, is that people are interested in the game. They are quiet and then involved when its needed. We really feel that the people are with you when you are playing, that they really are a part of the game.<BR></FONT><BR><I><FONT color=#ff812b>E: What do you do in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:City w:st="on">Paris</st1:City></st1:place> during your days off?</FONT></I><BR><BR><FONT color=#acac2b>M: I don’t stay in the hotel. There is a “must” for me: I go to the <I>Café de l’Homme</I>, owned by my friend Arnaud Casagrande (former coach of Nicolas Escudé). I usually go there on the first evening. I also go to <I>l’Avenue</I>, avenue Montaigne, <I>Chez André </I>at the hotel <I>Costes</I>…These are classics. I like eating and I like good food. I also like to sit on a “terrasse” outside of a café and observe people’s behaviour. How they walk, what they wear, how they behave…there are so many different personalities.<BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#ff812b><I>E: You stay at the hotel during the tournament. Did you never think about renting a flat here?</I><BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#acac2b>M: Years ago, I wanted to buy one. But French taxes…it’s a joke! And renting one…the advantage at the hotel is that someone cleans the room. If I rent an apartment with friends, it would become like a big garbage…three or four guys in a flat, can you imagine? (laughs)</FONT><BR><BR><FONT color=#ff812b><I>E: Does something surprise you in the French mentality?</I><BR></FONT><BR><FONT color=#acac2b>M: Some French are arrogant but I mostly find them cool and relaxed.<BR>They live a bohemian life. They like to sit down and talk for hours…We can recognize a French person from a 100 metres just because of his clothes or haircut. Me, that’s how I see them: sitting down at a “terrasse”, drinking tea or coffee and smoking a cigarette. The French enjoy life and I like that!</FONT><BR style="mso-special-character: line-break"><BR style="mso-special-character: line-break"></P><?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></STRONG></SPAN>
