                  PRESS CONFERENCE<br>
MATCH: MARAT SAFIN vs. NICOLAS ESCUDE<br>
                  RESULTAT / SCORE: 4-6, 2-5 (Ret.)<br>
                  MONDAY, JULY 30, 2001<br>
<br>
                  AN INTERVIEW WITH: MARAT SAFIN <br>
<br>
TOUR OFFICIAL: Questions for Marat?<br>
<br>
REPORTER: What was the injury, can you explain?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, it's my knee hurts a lot and I cannot 
                    serve.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: When did that start?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Last week.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: It looked like you were running around pretty good, 
                    though, earlier. How come it suddenly --<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but I didn't feel -- like I had problems. 
                    I couldn't serve and actually, every time I had to run, it 
                    is quite a lot of pain. I tried the first two sets and I couldn't 
                    play any more and just give up.<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Last week you said it was not so unpleasant.<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: It got worse and now I just -- I couldn't -- 
                    I don't feel like to play, you know, this way, and I can't 
                    do many things on court. On this type of surface, it is a 
                    lot of pain.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: Doubles?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I don't know yet. I don't know.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: Do you think that retiring at 6-4, 5-2 --<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I am sorry, what can I do? I think I am not 
                    this kind of guys that retired every time. So I think that 
                    they should give some respect, also to a player. I made some 
                    others lose last year, in Toronto, and I been playing for 
                    during all the year without any problems and made some great 
                    matches. And I just gave everything to the spectators and 
                    now that I don't feel like to play and I am like -- feel like 
                    injury, they are whistling me. You know, you think it is correct, 
                    I don't think it is correct, I don't think it is nice. Every 
                    time they think that they are right. And the player has to 
                    stay on the court -- I do not understand the attitude of those 
                    spectators.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: Do you have any idea of the importance of the injury?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I don't know. I don't know. I just felt like 
                    today it was just -- I wanted to retire earlier, but then 
                    I had just one break and I tried to break him. And if it's 
                    just -- just waiting for something. I feel like, I mean, when 
                    he broke me twice second set, I said I just can't. It is not 
                    a game anymore.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: At 4-3 in the first you had two breakpoints to 
                    come back. How did you feel at this time? Because it seemed 
                    that the game was not really --<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: It is like every time I was a little bit uncomfortable. 
                    But, yeah, also I am not playing very well. It is not only 
                    injury. I am not playing very well. And, just, I tried. And 
                    it's not I cannot do anything. I cannot force myself. I don't 
                    want to spend like, I don't know, whatever it takes injured 
                    again. I hope the spectators understand at least this.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: Did you feel any pain during warm ups?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, a little bit, but I thought it was going 
                    to be okay.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: Are you somewhat disappointed? Because obviously 
                    Sampras bowing out last night, you were the odds-on favourite 
                    to win again this year. Is this, obviously, not the way you 
                    wanted it to end, of course?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but also the people are coming, to watch 
                    tennis, at least they have to give some respect to the players, 
                    right, or not? We are not machines here. Nobody is coming 
                    here and going to die on the court. I am just asking for some 
                    respect. I don't think the way that they treat me today, when 
                    I went off of the court is correct. I don't think so. I never 
                    had any problems with anybody and during all the year, like 
                    I said before, I've been doing a great job. Now it's like 
                    first time it happens to me. Everyone's, like, pissed at me. 
                    I think it's not nice, actually.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: Do you regret your decision to retire with one 
                    game to go? Would you do it differently next time?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but just to stand on the court and just 
                    not touch the ball, I think it would be correct? They would 
                    treat me differently? I don't think so. I think if you don't 
                    feel like, if you feel injured, you are injured. You couldn't 
                    play anymore. Why to stay there, spend time of the spectators 
                    and spend time of the opponent, just -- I don't feel like 
                    to do this.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: Have you had this injury before, before last week? 
                    Is it something recurring?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I had it in Wimbledon. But it went quite okay. 
                    And now just maybe it's I just spent one week playing on hard 
                    court. That's why I have this thing.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: What is it exactly?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I don't know.<br>
<br>
TOUR OFFICIAL: Did you say it is tendinitis?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I think so.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: What is your best wish now from the next days, 
                    what do you want to do?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Well, I want just whatever decisions will be, 
                    I have to decide if I am going to play doubles or not. If 
                    not, I just -- I don't know, I will see if I have time and 
                    maybe I will take a few days off. Maybe I will do something. 
                    Maybe try to recover the injury.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: When you saw the draw, playing Escude first round, 
                    considering that you don't have a lot of confidence now, and 
                    that he beat you two times last year, did you feel sad with 
                    the draw? Do you think maybe an opponent easier, it would 
                    have been --<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I don't care. I am coming and I should just 
                    play my game and if I win it's great. If I lose it's nothing 
                    -- nobody going to die. It's bad luck. You lose first round, 
                    but that's life and you have to just keep on working and try 
                    to survive. I don't think it's going to be the last tournament 
                    of my life. It will not be the last time I will lose against 
                    him. So just keep on working.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: You were saying it was the reaction that you got 
                    that really displeased you. Is that something that just added 
                    to the fact that you decided to pull out, that made your knee 
                    hurt even more? And what exactly was it that you didn't like?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: What I didn't like?<br>
<br>
REPORTER: Yeah, you said that the reaction from the crowd, 
                    is that what you were talking about?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yeah.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: You are not used to that.<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I am not used to that, yeah. Because I never 
                    had this -- I never had problems with the crowd, never. The 
                    only thing they can get upset because I am throwing the racquets. 
                    But I think they get used to it and they treat me okay. But, 
                    I mean, the way -- what they did today is like -- it's amazing. 
                    It's the first time I feel like this, you know, feel guilty. 
                    I don't want to feel guilty, if they come to see tennis, they 
                    should understand a little bit more what is going on and they 
                    can understand tennis. But seems to me like they don't like 
                    me. It's not a problem, I don't care. But, you know, I am 
                    trying and I can't. I don't -- I am not feel like to play. 
                    I am injured. What can I do? Of course it's easy to eat popcorn 
                    and drink a beer in the stands. It is very easy. The guy is 
                    retired and they whistle him. It is a joke.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: It's a hockey town.<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: You have to survive, but still, come on guys, 
                    everyone's on tennis, and I am not this kind of guy. You can't 
                    just whistle because I am retired. It's like, come on. Be 
                    a little bit more clever. I don't know.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: Marat, just put your injury apart. Do you think 
                    three weeks is enough to build up your confidence for the 
                    U.S. Open?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No, no, not enough. I think you say, tour will 
                    be very short for me, but I can't just out -- of course I 
                    will try. But the way I am playing, the way I am physically, 
                    the way I am mentally, I cannot -- I don't feel like to fight. 
                    I am trying, but it's like nothing going right and everything 
                    I am doing is just bad. It's mistakes, it's negative reaction 
                    and every time they just smash you out of the court. And it's 
                    no good. What can I do?<br>
<br>
REPORTER: How does Mats feel about this?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Mats, you can imagine. The guy doesn't win one 
                    match in six months, how you going to feel? I don't think 
                    he is quite happy. But I think that we will have a great future 
                    if he still wants to work with me. I mean, next year I will 
                    try one more time, maybe it will work. If it's going to work, 
                    I am going to be tough guy and I am going to be very difficult 
                    to beat. But right now, I am not in my best shape.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: What is next for you? Can you practice more? Do 
                    you have to stay off the court for a bit?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I am out of everything.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: You are out of doubles now?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I said I don't know, I have to check with my 
                    physio.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: What is your next tennis activity? Can you practice 
                    on your own at all? How long are you sidelined for?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I am injured.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: I know. But how long, how badly are you injured?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I have to go to the doctor and check what he 
                    will say. It depends what he say. I can tell you when I will 
                    start to play.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: You stay off the knee until you go to a doctor, 
                    right?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yeah.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: Okay.<br>
<br>
TOUR OFFICIAL: Thanks.<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Okay. Thanks.<br>
