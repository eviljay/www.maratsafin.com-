                  Marat Safin - Paul-Henri Mathieu 6-4, 3-6, 6-1, 6-4.<br>
                  An Interview with Marat Safin</strong><br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>What is your feeling just after this victory? </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I hope it will help our team to win the Davis Cup. 
                  I mean, what else I can say? Just one point for us. We're looking 
                  forward to win it. Why not? <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>In the second set, you looked a little bit tired. Were 
                  you or not? </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: No. I lost a little bit of concentration. You know, 
                  I won the first set, and then I kind of just slowed down. He 
                  made me a first break, then I couldn't find my game back until 
                  the third set. <br>
                  The third and fourth, I played really good tennis. I was controlling 
                  the match basically. I'm satisfied with my game. To play on 
                  clay after a long season on hard courts, to be able to play 
                  a tough match against Mathieu, and in France, it means I'm in 
                  good shape. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Can you compare this match with the match against Mathieu 
                  in Moscow? </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: It was different. I never saw him play really. 
                  I never played against him. Moscow, I was kind of surprised 
                  the way he's playing because he is a great player. Of course 
                  he has a big future. He knows how to play, has unbelievable 
                  talent. He played well. He has nothing to lose in Moscow, and 
                  he was playing great tennis. <br>
                  But the second match, which was today, I knew already what I 
                  have to do, to not let him play his tennis. When he's dominating 
                  the match, he's really, really dangerous, so you need to do 
                  something, not let him control the match. I tried it, and it 
                  was good. I made it today. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>How nerve-wracking were those final few games? </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: You have to understand that I was nervous, of course. 
                  It's a Davis Cup final, the first match, first point, in front 
                  of all the crowd that is cheering for France. It's difficult 
                  to play your best. I mean, you're always playing your best tennis, 
                  but you kind of slow down. You think 5-2 your match is over 
                  basically, then you have to play one more game, to finish one 
                  more game, which I can't say that I played really bad that game, 
                  but he played well. <br>
                  I was rushing a little bit too much. I almost got broken twice 
                  in the fourth set. But then I played good. I was patient at 
                  some point.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>That match point when you double-faulted, what were 
                  you trying to do on that second serve? </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Just, you know, to not let him attack the ball. 
                  I wanted to put it really deep, but I was rushing. I wanted 
                  to finish really quickly because I wanted to get out of the 
                  court. I was rushing. That's why I served really too fast, I 
                  think. There was no time between the first and second serve, 
                  so it was kind of a mistake. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Did you have a problem with your shoes? </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Maybe because I'm a little bit too light, that's 
                  why I'm sliding too much (smiling). <br>
                  No, it's okay. The court is a little bit slippery. That's why 
                  sometimes, you know, you slide a little bit more than normal. 
                  But at the end I was getting used to it, and then it was okay. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>How fresh do you feel for the doubles tomorrow? </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Kind of really fresh (smiling). I didn't make anything 
                  for the last couple of weeks. I was just practicing, you know. 
                  I'm okay. Physically, I'm perfect. Mentally, I'm okay. <br>
                  We'll see how Yevgeny will play. If he will win, then we will 
                  be full of confidence and it will be a different story instead 
                  of if he going to lose. Then it's really, really a nervous match. 
                  <br>
                  It's not because of physical; it's more mental, I think. It's 
                  a Davis Cup, it's the final. I think it's more a psychological 
                  game than a physical. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>When you talk about the mental part, you also talk about 
                  the last games of the match when he broke you back. Was it more 
                  a mental thing? </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but he played well. He already had 5-2 down, 
                  he already had nothing to lose. He played really well. I served 
                  all the first service. Maybe I rushed. Like I said, I rushed 
                  a little bit. I wanted to finish the game really quickly. <br>
                  But I think he didn't make any mistake. Also I didn't make any 
                  stupid mistakes to lose that game. On a breakpoint, he make 
                  me an unbelievable winner from the second serve. What can you 
                  do? Then on match point, I was trying to put him a little back 
                  so he will not attack my second serve. That's why I made him 
                  double-fault, but it wasn't by far. <br>
                  But that's normal. It's final. Everybody's nervous. Everybody 
                  wants to win. <br>
