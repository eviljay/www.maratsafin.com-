                    during Tennis Master Series 2000 in Hamburg</b></font></p>
                  <p><br>
                    <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><b>Question:</b> 
                    Do you think the first set was the strongest you had to play 
                    since the beginning of the tournament?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Safin:</b> It was a little bit different, because I started 
                    very badly. I started like 3:0 down. I was completely out 
                    of the court, I missed easy balls from the baseline. Afterwards 
                    I just started to think, I just concentrated and I was trying 
                    to calm down and to realize the situation. After that I had 
                    0:30 on his serve, twice I think, I had a good chance, but 
                    I was too nervous at that moment to play the way I should 
                    have played these two balls. I had two easy balls and I missed 
                    them.</font> <br>
                    <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
                    I was a little bit upset. All the time I had 0:30 on his serve, 
                    and two easy balls, so after I lost the game I got a little 
                    bit disappointed. But after the tie-break I played my game. 
                    I was unlucky and he was three points up, but I tried to put 
                    the balls in. Why not, I had nothing to lose on the set. I 
                    just pushed him twice and I took the right decisions and sometimes 
                    I played unbelievable shots. I got him under pressure and 
                    he missed a few balls. That's it, then he was gone. After 
                    the tie-break I got confident in the second set and I just 
                    had to return his serve, that's it. After that I was with 
                    a lot of confidence.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> Was that an example of a match that you would have 
                    lost during the first four months of the year, because you 
                    would have got down in the first set?<br>
                    <br>
                    </font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><b>Safin:</b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    I'm not too sure if I would have lost the first set. He's 
                    also a player, if I lose the first set it would have not been 
                    a tragedy. I had to play and I'm ready to play. I have my 
                    game and I'm not afraid to play a three set match. I have 
                    the serve, I have almost everything, but I'm not scared. I'm 
                    not scared to fight against Marcelo. I know he is a great 
                    player, he was number one in the world. But still, I also 
                    know how to play tennis sometimes, you know. I'm not scared, 
                    I'm trying to play my game all the time. That's important, 
                    because if my game doesn't work, what can I do? What can you 
                    do? Nothing. But you have to be always under control. You 
                    have to know what you have to do and try to play your game 
                    all the time.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> You're playing Guga tomorrow. Can you something 
                    about that?<br>
                    <br>
                    </font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><b>Safin:</b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    I know I play against him. It will be a difficult match, because 
                    I know that he wants to win this match, because I beat him 
                    three times. We went to the fifth set twice and once we went 
                    to the third set into the tie-break. I hope it will not be 
                    tough for me, but I think it will be tough. I will just try 
                    to build my game every time, just be calm and I have to be 
                    confident with what I'm doing on the court. Everything under 
                    control, you know. I will try to do the same as this week, 
                    because my game was all the time under control. If I lose, 
                    I won't be upset, because I'm doing a great job. I'm playing 
                    at a great level. But I hope I will do my best tomorrow, I 
                    will give everything to beat him, because it is a final of 
                    a Super 9, well of the Masters Series, sorry. It's not a match 
                    of the first round, it's a final, so we'll see tomorrow who 
                    is the man. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> You beat him three times. What was your opinion 
                    why you beat him?<br>
                    <br>
                    </font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><b>Safin:</b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    I still don't know, because it's always a tough match, just 
                    two or three points difference. But sometimes I was lucky 
                    and sometimes I made the right decisions at the important 
                    moments. Okay, I know how to play against him, but they were 
                    always tough matches. I was just lucky, I think.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> This is your third final in four week. Are you amazed 
                    by that?<br>
                    <br>
                    </font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><b>Safin:</b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    No, why not? I work for it. It's great, it's coming up now. 
                    I've worked for six months and I was looking for my game and 
                    finally I found it. I hope I won't lose it again for the next 
                    six months. I hope it won't happen again. We'll see. It's 
                    great that I won two tournaments and that I'm in the final 
                    here. But I need something more, you always need more, like 
                    everybody, it's never enough.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> You're concentrating on your game, but do you also 
                    take the time to do other things as well here in Hamburg?<br>
                    <br>
                    </font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><b>Safin:</b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    Yes, good food, nice city and also good persons around me. 
                    It's a good atmosphere. I'm happy to be here. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> You had tremendous success on clay court. Do you 
                    consider yourself to be one of the favourites for Roland Garros?<br>
                    <br>
                    A: It's still one week to go until Roland Garros, and also 
                    Kuerten made it to two finals already, so we'll see, maybe 
                    he will win tomorrow. I don't think so, but there are more 
                    guys, like Norman and a few guys more. I think it would be 
                    nice if I was one of them, one of the favourites for Roland 
                    Garros. But I prefer to be nobody, so nobody expects a lot 
                    from me. Nobody is putting me under pressure, you know, that 
                    you have to win and you have be one of the favourites. Well, 
                    the time will come to see who is the favourite. But it's a 
                    tougher tournament. It's a big event and everybody wants to 
                    win there, because you get a lot of points. So everybody is 
                    going to fight. First of all you have to pass the first round 
                    there, and afterwards we will see.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q: </b>Do you feel that you've improved your game since 
                    Barcelona?<br>
                    <br>
                    </font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><b>Safin:</b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    No, I think I'm on the same level. Just some things changed, 
                    but I finally understand how I have to play. So I know what 
                    I have to do and I know my mistakes now. I can realize the 
                    situation which is very important. Of course I have to improve, 
                    but not now. But when I have time to work like in two or three 
                    weeks. Then we can talk after that if I have improved something. 
                    Right now I do the things in the right way, that's it.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q:</b> You don't seem to be too happy about your win. Come 
                    on, tomorrow could be the best day of your life. <br>
                    <br>
                    </font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000"><b>Safin:</b></font><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"> 
                    What do you want me to do, you want me to jump around here 
                    or what? The final is nice, but you don't have to be too happy, 
                    because tomorrow it's a final. After the final we will see 
                    how happy I will be. If I lose I will be also happy, because 
                    I made the way up. And if I win the tournament I will be happy 
                    because I'll be top ten, I hope so, and a few things more. 
                    But now I prefer to think about the match of tomorrow. And 
                    afterwards, we'll see, we're going to have a party for sure, 
                    definitely. If you want to hear this, okay. But for the moment 
                    not, because I'm still in the tournament and I don't want 
                    to lose this opportunity to win this tournament. I have some 
                    chances, I think. I'll wait until tomorrow, and then I'll 
                    do all these things. <br>
