                  19, 2002, Sports Palace &quot;Luzhniki&quot;, Moscow, RUS, by 
                  Nick Imison<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Argentina, who have enjoyed a spectacular return to Davis Cup 
                  after a ten-year absence from the World Group, face their first 
                  real test this weekend when they take on Russia in the semifinals 
                  of the 2002 Davis Cup by BNP Paribas in Moscow. At stake is 
                  not only a place in the final, but also a chance to become only 
                  the 11th nation to capture the prestigious Davis Cup trophy.<br>
<br>
In Davis Cup, every nation wants to play at home. The choice 
                    of surface and the support of the crowd can play a decisive 
                    part in the outcome of a tie. Since losing to Canada 4-1 in 
                    Montreal in 2000, Argentina has played six successive home 
                    ties and swept all before them to earn their first World Group 
                    semifinal appearance since 1990.<br>
<br>
Of course you have to have a little bit of luck on the way. 
                    Australia, who were dispatched 5-0 in the first round, were 
                    without an unfit Lleyton Hewitt and a semi-retired Patrick 
                    Rafter; while quarterfinal victims Croatia were only able 
                    to field Goran Ivanisevic in doubles as they pushed Argentina 
                    to a decisive fifth rubber.<br>
<br>
Both those victories were played out on a slow red clay court 
                    at Buenos Aires Lawn Tennis Club, quite a contrast to the 
                    more cavernous surrounds of the indoor Luzhniki Stadium, where 
                    a medium-paced carpet court has been laid for the three-day 
                    contest.<br>
<br>
The stadium was also used for Russia’s 4-1 quarterfinal victory 
                    over Sweden, although that tie was played on clay to neutralise 
                    the strengths of a team led by Australian Open champion Thomas 
                    Johansson. As soon as Russia’s semifinal opponents were known, 
                    there was never any doubt that this tie would be played on 
                    carpet.<br>
<br>
However this is a different Argentine side from the only 
                    team ever to reach a Davis Cup final. Guillermo Vilas and 
                    Jose Luis Clerc ground their opponents into the dirt as they 
                    reached the World Group final back in 1981, where an inspired 
                    John McEnroe led the United States to a 3-1 victory in Cincinnati. 
                    The current crop of Argentine players are more at home on 
                    faster surfaces, with David Nalbandian a shock finalist at 
                    Wimbledon, Juan Ignacio Chela reaching two hard court finals 
                    and Guillermo Canas capturing his first Tennis Masters Series 
                    title in Toronto.<br>
<br>
A stress fracture of the right wrist is preventing Canas 
                    from competing here, but such is the strength in depth in 
                    Argentine tennis that the country currently boasts four players 
                    inside the world’s top 25. Indeed it was Nalbandian who was 
                    missing from the singles line-up when the draw was made today.<br>
<br>
Russia has no such luxury in its choice of players, once 
                    again relying on its two-man team of Marat Safin and Yevgeny 
                    Kafelnikov to represent them in singles and doubles. The dislocated 
                    finger that troubled Kafelnikov during his victory in Tashkent 
                    last week appears to have healed, with the Russian admitting 
                    he is close to being “100 percent fit”. <br>
<br>
With little disparity in the Argentines’ rankings, today’s 
                    draw offered no further clues to the outcome of the tie. Safin 
                    will open up against Juan Ignacio Chela, with the head-to-head 
                    record standing at two victories apiece, although all four 
                    previous meetings have been on clay. Kafelnikov then takes 
                    on Gaudio, having lost their only previous encounter on hard 
                    court in Miami in 2001.<br>
<br>
Saturday’s doubles rubber sees Kafelnikov and Safin up against 
                    doubles specialist Lucas Arnold and Nalbandian, competing 
                    together for the first time. In Sunday’s reverse singles, 
                    Safin will take on Gaudio, followed by Kafelnikov versus Chela. 
                    Under the Davis Cup rules, nominations for these three rubbers 
                    can be changed.<br>
<br>
Argentine captain Alejandro Gattiker admitted that he was 
                    spoiled for choice in making the nominations. “It’s not easy 
                    to tell a Wimbledon singles finalist that he’s not in the 
                    team, but we have a very competitive team and some excellent 
                    players. The surface is better for our opponents, but we came 
                    here several days in advance and have adapted to the court.”<br>
<br>
Marat Safin, who competed alongside Kafelnikov in Tashkent 
                    last week, felt that the Russians were better prepared for 
                    the tie. “It was a better choice for us to play the tournament 
                    than to practise at home for two weeks. I think the result 
                    will reflect that choice.”<br>
