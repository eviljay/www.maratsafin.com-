                    M. SAFIN - S. GROSJEAN 0/6, 6/3/, 6/4</b> <br>
                    <b><br>
                    Q.</b> Go ahead, you were -- what did happen in that first 
                    set, you just couldn't get on track?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    M.SAFIN</b> No, it's very simple, just I had to play my first 
                    match very early, so I just got to wake up at 9, I'm not used 
                    to do this, waking up at 9, and I was -- after -- actually, 
                    in the first match I was completely out of the court, but 
                    I was just trying to put each ball in, and Alami hit a little 
                    bit crazy, so it was just a little bit more easy. I just got 
                    to put the ball inside of the court, but still I was making 
                    -- I was completely out of the court, I was in the bed. So 
                    after the match I went to sleep, and I woke up just two hours 
                    before the match, and I was -- I wasn't ready to play first 
                    set and here actually he played very good, I mean, he make 
                    some very good shots, and I wasn't ready, that's it, and after 
                    I just -- I warm up for 15 minutes, and after I played the 
                    second or third set, just like a normal match. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Is it easy psychologically to put aside a set like 
                    that you just blew off rather than -- <br>
                    <b><br>
                    M.SAFIN </b>No, just I tried, but I couldn't, I didn't -- 
                    I didn't even want to lose, I tried to -- at 5-Love at least 
                    I tried to win a game just to -- I mean, losing 6-Love is 
                    not -- I mean, is not a deal, and I just -- from the second 
                    set, just everything changed a different way. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>You were down in the third set too. How did you 
                    rally to come back?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> First of all, I mean, if the chair umpire, 
                    he's making these easy mistakes, and, I mean, it was clearly 
                    a let, I can feel it, I can hear -- I heard this, otherwise 
                    why do I have to discuss, because I had an easiest ball in 
                    the world. But it was completely short, I was standing there 
                    on the baseline and the chair umpire didn't say anything, 
                    and I just had to play this point. So it was -- I made the 
                    mistake. And after this game I get upset, I threw the ball 
                    out of the court, and he's putting me $500 fine. I mean, I 
                    don't understand this. So why we don't -- why we don't put 
                    any fines to the chair umpires when they make easiest mistakes? 
                    He make three or four mistakes this match. Probably to Grosjean 
                    he lost $15,000 with these two balls, three balls. Me also. 
                    If I would lose, I would lose because of this guy. It was 
                    there. The machine doesn't work, but I think he has an ear, 
                    no? He can hear this on the net. If I can hear this, he has 
                    to hear it, he has to be a little bitt more concentrated, 
                    just -- and then I said to myself, I can't do anything. I 
                    was -- I was really angry with him because a fine, but I had 
                    to play, I just tried to -- to come back and tried to put 
                    the balls -- the balls in and trying to -- to put pressure 
                    -- a bit of pressure on him because he has a big second serve, 
                    so I had to attack a little bit more. I played some good points, 
                    I was lucky, and I just -- I made -- I played very well.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> A year or so ago would you have been able to settle 
                    down like that after -- or would you --<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> No, it was -- it was normal 6-Love, 6-3, it 
                    was -- normally the score last year would be 6-Love, 6-3, 
                    thank you very much, bye-bye, see you, $500 of fine, it's 
                    normal. But now, when -- when they put me a fine like this, 
                    I mean, it's a little bit -- it can go anywhere. I mean, for 
                    what? For what? Just -- first of all, he make the mistake, 
                    one. Second, because nobody -- nobody even saw this ball, 
                    nobody just -- didn't do anything. And, I mean, no, but if 
                    he was running the machine, it's much easier than to hear 
                    the net, of course, I can understand this. But for me it's 
                    probably -- $500, it's nothing for me, but still, it's -- 
                    it's $500. And because of nothing. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Isn't this the year that they're supposed to be 
                    relaxing, allowing the players to express their anger a little 
                    bit more? Are you surprised that --<br>
                    <b><br>
                    M.SAFIN </b>Yeah, I have to -- they have to ch- -- I mean, 
                    of course, if you're making a show on the court, you know, 
                    throwing the racquet, telling the chair umpire that he's a 
                    very nice guy, I mean, I'm trying -- doing everything I know 
                    in the -- everything to -- to be -- I mean, fine, I think 
                    it's okay. But if you -- if you're in a tough match, you throw 
                    the ball out of the court, nobody -- I mean, it wasn't -- 
                    it was something incredible. I said some good words to the 
                    spectators or -- it wasn't -- I was -- I was angry, that's 
                    it. What happened? I mean, I didn't even -- it wasn't even 
                    close to the spectators I threw the ball, if it goes this 
                    way. Nobody's hurt, I didn't kill anybody, I didn't destroy 
                    any rackets, everything was perfect, we're trying to do our 
                    -- our best. But because of these rules and because of this 
                    chair umpire, I get fined $500. It's okay. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> What point in the third set was that? Was that early 
                    in the -- <br>
                    <b><br>
                    M.SAFIN</b> It was -- I mean, in the third game of the third 
                    set, I mean -- I mean the match was going perfectly. 6-Love 
                    for him, 6-3 for me, we were trying to -- there was a little 
                    bit of tension there, and we didn't even -- I throw once the 
                    racquet and it wasn't -- it wasn't enough -- I threw it to 
                    the net, that's it, that's it. Nothing happened, nothing else. 
                    And because of chair umpire, I get fined. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>GREG SHARKO:</b> Anything else for Marat?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Can you speak about playing Henman in the semifinals? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN</b> If I speak or if I -- <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> He won, he won his match.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN </b>Yeah, I know, I know. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Can you talk about playing him when you're 1-1 against 
                    him?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>M.SAFIN </b>Yeah, but it's a little bit different game 
                    from today, from this morning, from other day, just the question 
                    of who going to be more concentrating going to win this match. 
                    I mean, it's going to be two or three points. If we play well 
                    -- if Tim will play well, me, it will be just two, three points 
                    will decide the match. Because he's a serve and volley, so 
                    I will try to have -- I have to return if I want to -- you 
                    know, just putting pressure on him, that he knows I'm going 
                    to return each time, and, I mean, if he serves well he will 
                    -- he will try to put me under pressure in my serve. Very 
                    simple game. He will serve well, he will try to push me under 
                    pressure, the same way I will play. And after who is going 
                    to be stronger, who going to be a little bit more lucky, a 
                    little bit more concentrating going to win. I don't expect 
                    bill rallies, but that's a question of three, four points, 
                    not more. <br>
