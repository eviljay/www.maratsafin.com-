                    <br>
                    An interview with Marat just before the Kremlin Cup in ’98.<br>

                    - Marat, what is your mood right now?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat Safin</b> - Well, what can I say...For the past two 
                    weeks I've only appeared 5 or 6 times on court. I had some 
                    problems with my stomach. But now, thank God, it is back to 
                    normal. I don’t think that this induced downtime will stop 
                    me from playing well in the Kremlin Cup.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - What does ‘well’ mean for you? <br>
                    <b><br>
                    Marat Safin</b> - To get through as many rounds as possible. 
                    That is my goal for every competition. And that is why I never 
                    say to myself: "Whatever it takes I have to get to the semi-finals 
                    or the final!" If this is the goal you set yourself, you’ll 
                    be putting the racket back into the bag right after the first-round. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - Who don't you want to play at the start?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat Safin</b> - This year very strong players have come 
                    here - Kafelnikov, Peter Korda, Goran Ivanisevich. As for 
                    me I don't care who I play. I don't feel any diffidence. If 
                    I’d been afraid of people there’s no way in the world I’d 
                    have been able to get from the 210th to 50th during one season.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - Yeah, you've caused quite a stir this year. 
                    Take the French Open for example. It even seemed for a while 
                    that they were talking about you more than they were about 
                    Kafelnikov.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat Safin</b> - I have the greatest memories from Roland 
                    Garros. I was very glad to beat Andre Agassi and then the 
                    Champion Gustavo Kuerten. I was simply working at myself a 
                    lot because in that particular case anything was possible. 
                    My rise is not accidental. I guess I can call this year fantastic. 
                    Aspiration and luck combined together helped me to make this 
                    spurt. In the beginning of the year I had no money to pay 
                    for the travelling. Now I am the only one who supplies myself 
                    with money.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - So, you’re 100% happy with your results 
                    this year?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat Safin</b> - Not quite. After France I had a lousy 
                    spell. I lost in first rounds of 6 tournaments in a row. It 
                    wasn’t because I thought of myself as a star. Even now I don’t 
                    think of myself as one. It was just some psychological exhaustion, 
                    I lost my shape. By the way I think I mentioned that I always 
                    play badly in summer, when in November ,according to the last 
                    year, anyway, I do OK. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - Well that's easy to understand: the spirit 
                    wants some rest...<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat Safin </b>- Tennis players don't have much time left 
                    for recreation. Trips and tournaments non-stop, living in 
                    hotels...You work really hard during training, no hanging 
                    out. But to be honest, sometimes I really don't feel like 
                    hitting the ball on the court - I am so lazy. I only really 
                    get time to rest at the end of the year. Right now I am going 
                    to spend some time in Moscow. The best vacations are with 
                    parents. I only had a chance to see them for two months maximum 
                    this year. I only communicate with them by phone. I try to 
                    call them every two days.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - How do you spend your spare time?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat Safin</b> - Sometimes I feel like reading a book 
                    or playing computer games. At times I manage to go to a club. 
                    I like listening to music and I like different types of it: 
                    Metallica, Halloween, Enigma. I should say that the hours 
                    of rest I have are based completely on my mood, and my mood 
                    changes 10 times a day! <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - And what about if you are in a bad mood? 
                    What is the solution then? Marat Safin - Women! (laughter) 
                    There should always be a person that can help you out with 
                    advice and things. Of course your parents but in the most 
                    part I think it falls to the coach.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - Having spoken about women, do you have a 
                    steady relationship with somebody? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat Safin</b> - Yes.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - Among the WTA players, who’s your favourite?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    Marat Safin</b> - I won't be original: Anna Kournikova. She 
                    is a very beautiful girl or young lady - whichever you’d call 
                    her. I also like the German Jana Kandarr, she is more a model. 
                    But I like Anna and Jana more outwardly - from afar. For example, 
                    I wouldn't marry Anna. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> -So you’re saying that you’re already thinking 
                    about getting married?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat Safin</b> - As they say in one movie: "It can never 
                    be too early or too late to think about it." But I am not 
                    ready yet to have a family of my own, I am only 18. But closer 
                    to the age of 25, that would be more the right time. During 
                    this period I need to feel like I’m completely a man, to think 
                    about myself that way and to become a man. To achieve something, 
                    to be able to take care of two people... At the moment I’m 
                    only moving in this direction. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question </b>- A formal suit always fits a real man...<br>
                    <b><br>
                    Marat Safin</b> - Well, well, well... Here you go again remembering 
                    the Davis Cup. Well, I haven't bought myself a suit yet, I 
                    haven't. Despite that thing that I was jammed into then. In 
                    fact, I decided a long time ago: I should buy one. I keep 
                    telling myself every day: "That's it, today I'm going to the 
                    store." And then I think: what if I go tomorrow? And there 
                    I go: tomorrow, tomorrow... I have already told you what a 
                    lazy guy I am. Though...when I come to Spain in the end of 
                    the month I’m going to buy myself a suit. For sure! <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - What about football? Are you going to see 
                    the game "Spartak" vs. "Real"? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat Safin </b>- Actually I was thinking about it. I’ve 
                    been a Spartak fan since I was a kid. I was sorry I didn’t 
                    see their game with "Inter". It is a pity that nobody scored. 
                    By the way, if I wasn’t a tennis player, I would probably 
                    like to become a football player. Though, what a football 
                    player would I have been when I am so tall!? I lack co-ordination 
                    for football!<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - And what is it that you lack in tennis? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat Safin</b> - I need to work on my serve. Right now 
                    it seems to be my main weapon, the thing that can make me 
                    win. I have got big plans! Next year I want to get into the 
                    Top Ten. Maybe I could even carry a big stick at the first 
                    racket?... <br>
                    <br>
