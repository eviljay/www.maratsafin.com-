                  By Selena Roberts<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Under a thin veil of humidity, Nicolas Kiefer and Marat Safin 
                  were all but playing in front of a two-way mirror on the pit 
                  floor of Arthur Ashe Stadium yesterday, just contorted subjects 
                  in a study on mental stamina and pain thresholds.<br>
<br>
Holding debates with himself, planting his racket handle 
                    in his mouth, the second-seeded Safin kept begging the sky 
                    for answers behind his fickle talent as the match inched past 
                    its fourth hour.<br>
<br>
                    Across the net, his legs reddened by fifth-set ice treatments 
                    for cramps, his desire obvious as the epic played out, Kiefer 
                    kept willing his fickle body to hold up at the United States 
                    Open.<br>
<br>
What would give first, Safin's head or Kiefer's legs? Officials 
                    rolled two wheelchairs into the courtside tunnel should either 
                    player buckle, and a riveted crowd sat wondering what was 
                    next in the first-round match.<br>
<br>
Between Safin's catharses and Kiefer's yelps, fans saw them 
                    pull off amazing shots under stress. Saving a match point 
                    in the 12th game of the fifth set, Kiefer hobbled forward 
                    on a surprise serve-and-volley that left Safin wrong-footed 
                    and on his seat. In disbelief, Safin laughed at the absurdity 
                    of Kiefer's effort. On the ninth point of the fifth-set tie 
                    breaker, Kiefer scrambled forward for a short ball but collapsed 
                    in pain on the run.<br>
<br>
Safin called a trainer for his crumpled opponent and stood 
                    over him until Kiefer picked himself up to face yet another 
                    match point. After Safin shanked a nervous return, he finally 
                    sidestepped the upset when Kiefer plopped a weary forehand 
                    into the net after 4 hours 31 minutes on the court.<br>
<br>
The lab experiment was over. Safin's mind had barely held 
                    up against Kiefer's body in a 6-3, 4-6, 4-6, 6-4, 7-6 (4) 
                    victory.<br>
<br>
&quot;In the tie break, I was really scared because I didn't 
                    want to lose,&quot; said Safin, who tried to make up for every 
                    mindless unforced error (64) with a lifesaving winner (66). 
                    &quot;I was really choking.&quot; Candid and charismatic as 
                    usual, Safin advanced alongside 11th-seeded Andy Roddick and 
                    top-seeded Lleyton Hewitt, who picked apart Nicolas Coutelot 
                    in straight sets.<br>
<br>
Safin's issues have nothing to do with an injury. It's all 
                    in his head. He has had a pattern of coming undone since he 
                    coolly dismantled Pete Sampras for the 2000 United States 
                    Open title. <br>
<br>
Against Kiefer, he was doing it again, wanting his opponent 
                    to hand him the match instead of taking it. If Kiefer had 
                    to retire with cramps, all the better.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was praying for it,&quot; Safin said with a smile. 
                    &quot;Because I couldn't do it anymore, and I wanted to finish 
                    this match because it was just terrible.&quot;<br>
<br>
Terrible to Safin, wonderful for the crowd. If anyone was 
                    looking for a splash of excitement on the men's tour, Safin 
                    and Kiefer supplied the color. By the time the fifth set began, 
                    Safin had smashed two rackets out of frustration and grown 
                    hoarse from chastising himself.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was going nuts,&quot; Safin said. &quot;I had no 
                    more rackets and the chair umpire already told me that I should 
                    be careful. I had no more power to shout or throw the rackets, 
                    so I couldn't anymore.&quot;<br>
<br>
Instead of venting on his equipment, he stomped his feet, 
                    shrugged his shoulders and huffed out loud. He was tortured. 
                    Who wouldn't be?<br>
<br>
Safin had a chance for an early break of Kiefer's serve in 
                    the fourth game of the fifth set. But Kiefer saved six break 
                    points with a combination of aces and Safin's miscues. At 
                    one point, Safin gnawed on his racket in anger. <br>
<br>
Even when Safin eventually went up a break to go ahead, 5-3, 
                    with a tantalizing chance to serve out the match, the 6-foot-4 
                    Russian mentally caved in by serving a double fault to give 
                    Kiefer a fighting chance. Despite the onset of cramps and 
                    visits by a trainer, Kiefer had life.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was the whole legs, the groin,&quot; Kiefer said. 
                    &quot;I had never had cramps before. I just saw it on TV, 
                    but now it happened to me.&quot;<br>
<br>
He is no ordinary midlevel player. While Kiefer is No. 64 
                    on paper, it's a deceptive ranking. Two years ago, he was 
                    No. 4 in the world, but a pair of wrist injuries and a lack 
                    of confidence pulled him down. Reassembling his game since 
                    spring, Kiefer proved how desperate he was for a major victory 
                    yesterday, if only to validate the work he put into his comeback. 
               <br>
<br>
Limp or no limp, he wanted to end the match standing, not 
                    exiting in the awaiting wheelchair.<br>
<br>
&quot;I was playing for four hours,&quot; Kiefer said. &quot;It 
                    was 6-all in the fifth set, only 5 or 10 minutes to go.&quot;<br>
<br>
The time expired on his legs when he fell to the court on 
                    a scramble for a ball on the ninth point of the tie breaker, 
                    leaving him down by 6-3.<br>
<br>
&quot;I couldn't move anymore,&quot; Kiefer said. &quot;From 
                    the head, I wanted to hit the ball, but my legs didn't move.&quot;<br>
<br>
He stood for the final match points, then hobbled away from 
                    the court, as fans stood to salute him. For several minutes, 
                    Safin just sat in his chair. He was weary — even he needed 
                    ice treatment — but his sturdy frame was no worse for wear. 
                    It was his mental stamina that was tested.<br>
<br>
&quot;First set was great, then I completely lost my concentration,&quot; 
                    Safin said.<br>
<br>
But a similar situation unfolded two years ago, when Sйbastien 
                    Grosjean nearly took out Safin in a classic five-set match 
                    before the Open barely began. From there, Safin went on to 
                    win the Open. Who is to say it couldn't happen again?<br>
<br>
&quot;Everything is possible in this life, as you can see,&quot; 
                    Safin said.<br>
