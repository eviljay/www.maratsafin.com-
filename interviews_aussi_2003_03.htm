                  Marat Safin Withdraws<br>
                  An interview with: MARAT SAFIN </b><br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  MODERATOR: Questions for Marat. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. What's the reason for your withdrawal?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: My wrist is bothering me, and I decided not to 
                  play.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Disappointed? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, kind of. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. When did you feel the pain for the first time? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: In the first match. I fall down, and then I hit 
                  the backhand a little bit too late, and I felt some pain here. 
                  Afterwards, for the second match, they put me injection, so 
                  I didn't feel in the second match. Afterwards, at night, I had 
                  my wrist really big. Just I couldn't move it. So no reason to 
                  play.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Is there a diagnosis? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, is a cut in the ligament.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. A what?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: A small cut.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. In the ligament?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yes.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Do you know how long you will be out?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: The doctor says two, three weeks. Vacations (smiling).<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. When you say you're kind of disappointed, are you looking 
                  forward to a little bit of rest now?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. Yeah, some time off, because of long season 
                  last year, I have a few weeks now off. It will be good. Is good 
                  for me.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Will you be ready for Davis Cup?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I'm not sure. Not sure. I will see. I will check 
                  every week. I will try to do something to help to recover and 
                  we'll see. But I'm not sure for Davis Cup will be ready. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. What sort of treatment do you have to get for this sort of 
                  injury?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Not much you can do. Ice, laser. Doctors, they 
                  know.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Mostly rest?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Do you feel like you've been very unlucky in Australia this 
                  year? The shoulder in Sydney, now this wrist. <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but I'm unbeatable in Australia (smiling). 
                  Yeah, actually was very bad luck. I started to play well in 
                  Sydney, I got injured with problems with my shoulder. Here, 
                  very first match, just got injured. Because I'm already in second 
                  round, I start to play better. To fly 24 hours here, you know, 
                  leave from here without any success is not really good. That's 
                  life. What you can do? <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. You've talked a lot about the long season, more time off. 
                  I'm wondering if you're going to reduce your schedule this year? 
                  Do you think these injuries are a result of playing too much 
                  last year?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, because everybody's getting injured. As you 
                  can see, tennis is becoming too physical. Everybody's trying 
                  to play tournaments and everybody -- because level of tennis 
                  is so high, the bodies of the players, they cannot anymore. 
                  So that's why you need to take a few weeks' rest. Every time 
                  you play two, three weeks, you also need to take a few weeks 
                  off, otherwise you cannot, because the body is getting tired 
                  really fast.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Will you play less this year, do you think, than last year?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Even if before I played like around 35 weeks a 
                  year, so now if you're playing 25, is more than enough. I've 
                  been playing last year not so much actually. Play 25 weeks. 
                  You cannot play less. In the Masters Series, with Davis Cup, 
                  with Grand Slams, it's becoming already 19 weeks. But you also 
                  have to play a few tournaments, some other tournaments. So it's 
                  already 25. <br>
                  And the schedules, we don't have rest at all, the tennis players. 
                  So it's difficult. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. I know you're no longer in the tournament. Who do you think 
                  might get through your quarter of the draw, Blake or Federer? 
                  Who do you think might win the title?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I didn't even see the draw. I don't really care. 
                  Definitely the best one who's in the best shape right now. The 
                  same people like Federer. But everybody can play tennis. Everybody 
                  can be in the semifinals. I don't need to just say the names. 
                  Everybody can be there, even the people who are not seeded can 
                  also play great tennis. We'll see. I really don't know. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. You've spoken about drug testing. Do you still feel the same 
                  way, that you're not in favor of it, it's too invasive in players' 
                  lives?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but the people, they're not taking anything, 
                  so they don't have to be scared. I'm not scared. I believe, 
                  and I still believe, the player to be able to play great tennis, 
                  you don't have to take -- you don't need to take drugs, you 
                  know. Just to play a tennis match, you can have the vitamins, 
                  all these things, but you don't need to take drugs to be able 
                  to play a match of the year.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. But you don't think it's necessary to do testing?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Of course, why not? We've been doing test like 
                  every year since I'm playing. We are doing drug testing, so 
                  why not? They don't have to go too deep. That's their decisions. 
                  I'm not scared. Just whatever the people, they say, we do. If 
                  it's good for tennis, that's great. If it's a great idea to 
                  make drug testing, I'm okay with that. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Have you been selected at random this week for any blood 
                  testing? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: No. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Did the doctor advise you to not play?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. I asked. I can feel myself I cannot just 
                  hold the racquet. I spoke to the doctor. He said, &quot;Just 
                  don't do that.&quot; <br>
                  Still a long time to go. The year is just beginning. Just one 
                  tournament, why would I destroy all my season? I prefer to stop 
                  now, even if it's a Grand Slam. Still the health is more important 
                  than the rest of the things. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. When do you go back to Russia?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Today. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. If you cannot play Davis Cup, what will be your next tournament?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I will try to come back for Rotterdam for indoors, 
                  play a few weeks before the Masters Series, Indian Wells, Miami, 
                  play a few matches. I'm not sure I'm going to be ready for Davis 
                  Cup. I'll try to do my best. But otherwise Rotterdam, Dubai.
