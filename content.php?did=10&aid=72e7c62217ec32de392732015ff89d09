<H4>Bruce Arthur, National Post</H4>Published: Wednesday, August 09, 2006 </DIV>
<DIV class=para12 id=article>
<P>TORONTO - You can have Roger Federer. You can keep Rafael Nadal. Andy Roddick? Pfft. If you had to pay to watch one tennis player play one match, your money should go to a madman ranked 77th in the world, hands down.</P>
<P>Yesterday, the world's only Shakespearean tennis star returned to Toronto for another typically tumultuous performance. Marat Safin, the magnetic 26-year-old Russian, was shoehorned in between Nadal in the afternoon session and Federer in the evening, but those fans who stuck around were rewarded with a performance worthy of Lear.</P>
<P>Safin, playing a first-round match against seventh-seeded veteran Tommy Robredo, was both brilliant and baleful, awesome and awful, raging against ghosts one minute, and making balls vanish past Robredo the next.</P>
<P>In other words, another day at the office.</P>
<P>"He's No. 1," said one adoring tournament volunteer, "for excitement."</P>
<P>Safin was No. 1 in the rankings back in 2000 at the tender age of 20.</P>
<P>Today he is 26, coming back from six months lost to a knee injury. Last month, Safin lost to the 512th-ranked player in the world. Two weeks later, he beat James Blake, ranked sixth, en route to the semi-finals of the Legg-Mason tournament in Washington. He is just 17-15 this year.</P>
<P>"[In Washington], I was very close to going to the final, probably would have won the tournament, because I was playing really well -- and everything slips away," said Safin yesterday after falling to Robredo 7-5, 5-7, 6-2. "Like the water through the hands. You are there, but something is missing."</P>
<P>With Safin, something is almost always missing. Yesterday, the 6-foot-4, 195-pound giant interspersed every kind of breathtaking shot -- axe-sharp forehands, overpowering backhands, volleys as delicate as parchment -- with errors so errant that it was a wonder they stayed in the Rexall Centre.</P>
<P>They didn't always, of course. At 1-1 of the second set, Safin was broken at love after a backhand sailed inexplicably long, and he hammered Robredo's post-point return with a swinging volley that flew away over the broadcast booth and out of the stadium. Naturally, that explosion of emotion, along with his many others, was applauded.</P>
<P>"I think he's got gigantic charisma as a personality," says Dmitry Tursunov, Safin's doubles partner and good friend. "When he's playing well, he's one of the best players, the most talented out of all of them. But I think that he's also a little bit of a superstar in a way that sometimes he can whine, he can complain, and somehow people enjoy that even though it might be the most ridiculous thing.</P>
<P>"Kind of like Anna Kournikova -- she could come out and start whining about anything, and people would just adore her."</P>
<P>Indeed, yesterday Safin followed various mistakes by throwing up his arms in despair, or by unleashing a roar, or by smacking a helpless ball about 100 feet into the air. Almost every time, the crowd loved it.</P>
<P>"It's me, for the good and for the bad," said Safin, sprawled on a couch in the players' lounge. "Sometimes I get frustrated, I get warnings here and there -- it's my tennis. It's how I am. People, they like it, and I like the fans. They've been amazing throughout my career, even though I slipped so many times on the court."</P>
<P>He does reward that love with a burst of sustained brilliance every once in a while. Safin was the last man to win a major before Federer and Nadal combined to win the last seven Grand Slams, upsetting Federer en route to the 2005 Australian Open.</P>
<DIV class=container>
<DIV class=para12 id=article>
<P>It was the second major of Safin's career, following the 2000 U.S. Open, when he dismantled Pete Sampras in straight sets. Afterwards, Sampras called Safin "the future of the game."</P>
<P>But in between and since, Safin has been the man in the rigging, swinging back and forth. He may be the most talented tennis player in the world -- Tursunov says "I think the only person who could really come close is Roger." But alone, talent is not enough.</P>
<P>"He has women just throwing themselves at him, he's got the money, he's got the fame, people love him, he can buy anything he wants to," says Tursunov. "It's hard to all of a sudden to decide to throw it all away and concentrate and work hard and go nuts over losing a tennis match. If he had Nadal's focus and tunnel vision about tennis, yeah, he'd be No. 1. But very few people have that."</P>
<P>Still, Safin is one of the most popular players on the tour -- a relentlessly charming, introspective, transparent man. And though he seems constantly on the verge of smashing the racquet for good, he keeps on chasing his game, and himself.</P>
<P>"Why quit? To quit is the easiest solution, to just run away from the problems, but the problems will catch you sooner or later," says Safin. "Tennis has been great for me ... tennis brought me up, all the money that I make, all the places that I visited, the hotels that I stay in, the people I met -- everything that happened in my life is just thanks to tennis.</P>
<P>"Without tennis, I wouldn't be nobody. Just because the tennis is shit, I can't complain and say that it's enough ... I still think I can be in the top 10, for sure. Tennis right now is pretty open. I keep on trying. The money I have, it's not like I'm suffering and starving and living in the streets. I have a great life, and I still have to give back to tennis, for what tennis gave to me."</P>
