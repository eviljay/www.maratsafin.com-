                    1998 - An interview with Marat from the US Open 1998 <br>
                    after he lost to Pete Sampras of the USA 6-4 6-3 6-2 in the 
                    fourth-round.</b></font></p>
                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><br>
                    <br>
                    Q.</b> You went out there saying the other day that you didn't 
                    think you had a chance. Did you think you had a chance after 
                    the first serve?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No, because normally he made two aces 
                    per game, so it's very difficult to play. I didn't return 
                    so well. I make my serve, he make first set break at 4-All. 
                    It was a break, maybe it's a lucky break because it was one 
                    double-fault, because passing shot, unbelievable passing shot. 
                    Maybe could be, I don't know, 7-5, 6-4, 6-2. But I think it's 
                    enough for me. He shows me how it is playing No. 1 of the 
                    world. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Having played Pete Sampras, how much do you think 
                    your game needs to improve so you can get on his level? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>I have to improve too many things to be 
                    like Pete. He played tennis perfect, almost perfect. That's 
                    why he's No. 1 for seven years or eight years, because he 
                    has unbelievable serve. You can see, he serve over 100, second 
                    and first serve. He made today 18 aces. He put the ball all 
                    the time close to the line, so it's very difficult to return. 
                    He put many pressure all the time because he's moving to the 
                    net all the time. He played perfect, I think.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>He said that he thought at some point here you'll 
                    have to start hitting your groundstrokes less hard so that 
                    you'll keep the ball in play more. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think I had more chances on the baseline. 
                    When you make a point normally, I won the point. I mean, I 
                    feel much better when we playing on baseline because I was 
                    playing all the time on his backhand, and he missed some balls, 
                    because the forehand is no problem. He just make a winner. 
                    If he's moving to the net, it's very difficult to pass him. 
                    When he stay on the baseline, I had some chances to win the 
                    point. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Did the break in play affect you? You came out and 
                    he broke you I think the first game. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> How much did that affect the outcome of the match?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I have to fight to break him. But it was 
                    impossible today. I didn't make just one break. Couldn't make 
                    it. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q</b>. Did the weather delay bother you?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>No.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> The two hours. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No. It doesn't matter, because it was 
                    again just serve and volley. That wasn't the rallies, so it 
                    doesn't matter. You just have to serve, volley, maybe two, 
                    three groundstrokes, nothing more. So it doesn't matter the 
                    weather.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>I know that you've had a tough summer after the 
                    French. But when was the last time you felt helpless against 
                    a player? Pete really handled it. When was the last time you 
                    felt that way? Obviously, you're a top player. It's been a 
                    long time, I would think.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> One more time.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> I'm wondering when was the last time you felt on 
                    a court where no matter what you did, this guy is just too 
                    good, too big for you? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> In the summer, I didn't feel like this. 
                    It wasn't this problem. Because when I'm playing Sampras, 
                    he's playing like this. In the summer was I play against the 
                    guys who are playing more or less my level, because this unbelievable 
                    level, is No. 1 in the world. The other guys was maybe 50, 
                    40. I mean, you can play against them. They are very good 
                    players, but you can play against them. But I couldn't put 
                    one ball in, nothing. I couldn't do anything because when 
                    I hit the ball, I didn't feel where it will go, maybe two 
                    meters out. It was one bounce on my side. It was like this 
                    all the time. Then I feel I couldn't do anything.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Have you been called for that many foot faults? 
                    Is that unusual for you? Does that happen quite a bit?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> It's happening. But sometimes maybe it 
                    wasn't my fault. Maybe I think it's the people. Sometimes 
                    -- I mean not in my match, in other matches it was, I think 
                    my coach told me in one match I make on TV, was the second 
                    serve, set point, second serve, foot fault. I mean, you can't 
                    do this. Second serve for set point, you call foot fault. 
                    I mean is not correct, I think this.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>How disappointing is this loss to you?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>For me?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Yes. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> For me it's okay. All my matches like 
                    this. Sometimes when you're losing, they're calling foot fault, 
                    you get more nervous. But I have to improve this too, because 
                    you can't make ten foot faults on one match. I have to work 
                    on it. It's not normal. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>After you beat Dent, you were saying, "He shouldn't 
                    hit the ball so hard." You said, "I used to be like that. 
                    I used to do the same thing." Pete said today that you need 
                    to not hit the ball so hard. I'm wondering if you felt you 
                    were playing like you used to, you were going for it a lot 
                    more than you usually do?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No. I hit the ball like this all the time. 
                    It's normal, normal shot for me. I didn't go for too much 
                    today. It's just my game. I didn't hit the ball so hard. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> You didn't?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah. Because I know if I hit so hard, 
                    I can't play like this all the match. This is my shots, normal 
                    shots. Dent, the other day, he was going for too much for 
                    sure.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>What was the most impressive thing about Pete for 
                    you? What impressed you the most about him? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Nothing. Just he's No. 1. He played perfect, 
                    perfect. Nothing more.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>You see him on TV. You know he's No. 1. What's it 
                    like when you get on a court against the No. 1 player, playing 
                    very sharp tennis? It must be more than you expected. No or 
                    yes? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I couldn't do anything today.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Was this a really good experience for you, though, 
                    to play him in the stadium court here at the US Open?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Not bad, but not so easy (laughter).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Does it inspire you, like maybe you can be someday 
                    as good as he is or better?<br>

                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Oh, very tough. I think I can't play this 
                    game. Who knows what can happen, but I would like to play 
                    like this. I will try (laughter). But I'm not sure, because 
                    I have to work a lot to be like him. Half of Pete Sampras, 
                    to be half of Pete Sampras, is enough for me. <br>
