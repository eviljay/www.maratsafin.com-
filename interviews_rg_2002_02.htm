                    Q. It was a nice diving shot?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yes.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Have you done it before?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Is more important than it was nice. It was in 
                    the right moment, the right time. It was good (smiling).<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Can you look back at your match today, long, ups and downs? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: It was long actually because if you take the 
                    first set, I couldn't serve very hard because I still have 
                    some problems in my back. But then that's why I lost I think 
                    the first one. I was a break. Then the second set, I start 
                    to feel better, start to play better. But he was playing great 
                    match. I think he was playing one of his best matches. He 
                    was difficult opponent. He played well from the baseline. 
                    He was playing great, really good tennis. But then in the 
                    fourth set, finally I broke him. I had my opportunities, but 
                    every time I know I try to do something, I miss all the time. 
                    But at the end, I'm glad that I fought until the end. I had 
                    my chance and I took them. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Did you expect that from him, that level of tennis?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, because -- not such a great match. Because 
                    he was in the right moment, you know, every important moment 
                    he was serving well or he was playing great point. It was 
                    really quite difficult for me, you know, to find the motivation 
                    after these kind of points. But I start to play well since 
                    fourth set. You know, I start to feel great on the court. 
                    I start to be focus. I am happy the way I'm playing. Still 
                    I have some things to improve, some confidence. But I'm hitting 
                    the ball well. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. When you say you feel great, you refer to your back also? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You feel better?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, much better. Because for me it takes time. 
                    When I start the match, I'm always a little bit cold, so I 
                    need some few games to serve slowly. But then I start to serve 
                    well. In the fourth set and fifth set, I was serving over 
                    200 kilometers an hour. That means I'm okay. I hope the back 
                    will be okay for next days. And also my tennis, I will have 
                    more confidence than today the beginning of the match.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. He was not built like your average pro. Can you talk about 
                    the challenges? Can you talk about the challenges of playing 
                    a guy who is basically a foot shorter than you are?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but you have also -- the small guys, he 
                    has great touch, great baseline, great anticipation. He's 
                    small, but he doesn't -- he looks like he's not running almost. 
                    He has great anticipation, great hands, very talented guy. 
                    And me, I'm big. Okay, I have power. But I don't have touch. 
                    You know, it's more or less split up.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Sometimes it seems some of the smaller guys like Santoro, 
                    some of the talented guys can give you trouble. Good sign 
                    that you kept it together and pulled it out?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. The small guys, most small guys, they are 
                    very fast, great anticipation, and great hands. They're very 
                    quiet. They're smarter than the tall ones some moments.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You already lost to him. Did you take that one as a warning?<br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. You have to be careful with these kind 
                    of players. I lost to him last year in the Hopman Cup indoors.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. But that was the 1st of January, wasn't it? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Okay, but still I lost (laughter). It counts 
                    also, so...I was quite disappointed. But, you know, I think 
                    he's a great player, great player, talented. I was amazed 
                    at the way he played today and the way he fought today actually. 
                    He never give up at any point. For me, it was actually a pleasure. 
                    I think it was a great match to watch, high quality. He gave 
                    110%. I think he was quite tired in the fifth set, and that's 
                    why I won. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. The fact that everyone supported him, I think that was 
                    no surprise to you. That didn't bother you, or did it?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No. I mean, it's okay. You have to support. I 
                    think, &quot;Okay, you are a fan favorite like everybody says.&quot; 
                    I'm not inventing anything. So the guy is coming on the court, 
                    he has nothing to lose. He's small. He has charisma. So, of 
                    course, everybody's supporting him. Also he's a French-speaking 
                    person, right? Belgium. Next to France. I think they're closer. 
                    Rochus is closer to the French people than Russian to the 
                    French. Maybe that's the reason. I don't know. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. If we take you out of the draw, what do you think the chances 
                    are of the champion being from South America this year? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Actually, let's start this way. Tennis is changing. 
                    Everybody's playing great, and everybody can beat anybody. 
                    I mean, the guys from Top 20 to Top 70, they can give you 
                    troubles. They can give troubles to Top-10 players easily. 
                    They can even beat them. So you -- this year I think will 
                    be maybe a surprise or somebody going to be the -- the semifinals 
                    going to definitely be some players that will surprise you. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. I actually mean Argentina. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Argentina, yes. Argentina, this surface, clay. 
                    It's going to be Argentina, I don't know. It can be anybody. 
                    I don't know. But Argentina, they are playing great this year. 
                    Gaudio is playing well. Played two tournaments on clay. Zabaleta 
                    beat Kafelnikov, also playing good. Canas I think also is 
                    dangerous. He made some good results in Dusseldorf. You have 
                    to be careful all these people, not only Argentinians.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. To Wimbledon this match is more relief or joy for you?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: It's the kind of match that you have to win. 
                    Doesn't matter how, but you have to win. I don't know. I'm 
                    happy that it passed away actually, and I don't have to go 
                    back to the court and start it over again. So for me it was 
                    -- I'm happy that it's over. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Any regrets about playing in World Team Cup? Some people 
                    thought you should rest. Two years ago you played and you 
                    were very tired when you came here. This year same thing, 
                    in the final in Hamburg, you play World Team Cup. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: It's a great preparation. World Team Cup is a 
                    great expectation. Actually you're not tired. One day you 
                    play, one day you don't play. So basically it's four matches 
                    if you're in the final. You finish on a Saturday. You have 
                    one day off. I mean, for somebody it doesn't make any sense 
                    to play. But for me it makes sense. For me, one week -- one 
                    more week of practice on clay, especially my game is more 
                    or less adapted to hard court, so for me it's very important. 
                    I need it, extra week. <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
