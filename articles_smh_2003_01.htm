                  January 6 2003<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <em>The giant world No 3 from Russia will have fewer distractions 
                  in the stands than he did last summer, reports Jessica Halloran. 
                  </em><br>
<br>
                    There will be no &quot;beautiful bench&quot;. The blondes, 
                    with plunging necklines, the trio who adorned the Australian 
                    Open stands last year, had nothing to do with Mr Marat Safin. 
               <br>
<br>
Revelation No 1: they were not part of his entourage. There's 
                    no such thing as a &quot;Safinette&quot;.<br>
<br>
&quot;Let's put it this way, I have nothing to do with these 
                    ladies. I'm not going to explain, but I have nothing to do 
                    with that, I swear to God,&quot; Safin said firmly.<br>
<br>
&quot;They were friends of my friends that asked me to get 
                    them tickets . . . I got them tickets, it's not a problem.&quot;<br>
<br>
Revelation No 2: &quot;They are not my types.&quot; Safin 
                    said this with a little grin - but he meant it. What is his 
                    type? &quot;My type? Not this type.&quot;<br>
<br>

                  And don't expect a new, authorised bench this summer. &quot;Just 
                  myself - coach, doctor,&quot; he said.
           <br>
<br>
No blondes, even though Safin clearly stated at the open 
                    in Melbourne last summer: &quot;You have to admit I have an 
                    unbelievably beautiful bench.&quot; Not that they have anything 
                    to do with the giant Russian.<br>
<br>
Safin's skin was a patchwork of sunburn yesterday after he 
                    practised on Rebound Ace. But his -30C Russian tan should 
                    soon disappear under the Sydney sun. <br>
<br>
After working with five different coaches in the previous 
                    three seasons, Safin is back in Sydney with Denis Golovanov, 
                    whom he appointed last November. Golovanov is an &quot;old 
                    friend&quot; Safin grew up with.<br>
<br>
&quot;I make a deal with him for one year and let's see if 
                    we can do some great things this year,&quot; said the 22-year-old 
                    who is ranked No 3 in the world and is the top seed at the 
                    adidas International at Homebush Bay this week.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's difficult to find a guy who can coach and travel 
                    with you all the time and you can trust. I know him really 
                    well. I don't know if it's the right decision - a bad decision 
                    or a good decision - but it's a decision I made because I 
                    couldn't find any other guy I trust.&quot;<br>
<br>
Safin would love nothing more than to win a grand slam event 
                    and be No 1 in the world.<br>
<br>
&quot;That's my goal [to get both], it's too much maybe, 
                    but that's the draw, we live because of the dreams.&quot;<br>
<br>
But to achieve this &quot;dream&quot; he said some glitches 
                    in his game must be fixed - glitches he describes as &quot;not 
                    a tennis thing&quot; but a &quot;mental thing&quot;. <br>
<br>
&quot;Sometimes my concentration just goes away in the game 
                    and it's difficult to [get it to] come back,&quot; he said. 
               <br>
<br>
&quot;That's why sometimes I'm suffering. I understand this. 
                    I know what I have to do but it's really, really tough to 
                    bring myself to this level.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm trying and I'm trying, and I'm growing up. I'll 
                    be 23 soon and I'm hoping I'll manage to bring this level 
                    to my game.&quot;<br>
<br>
Safin said even though Lleyton Hewitt had shown less than 
                    stellar form at the Hopman Cup last week, the world No 1 would 
                    still be a real threat at the Australian Open.<br>
<br>
Safin believes it's &quot;more important not to play real 
                    well before a big tournament&quot; because some players wear 
                    themselves down.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's better to start slowly and win a couple of matches,&quot; 
                    he said.<br>
<br>
Safin was also philosophising about his life at yesterday's 
                    press conference. Softly spoken with his gentle hand gestures, 
                    he said his life was all about living for the moment.<br>
<br>
&quot;This is the best time . . . enjoy every moment of your 
                    life, every day and not regret afterwards,&quot; he said. 
                    &quot;It's really important to enjoy what you are doing, enjoy 
                    the way you are living because time is running really fast, 
                    every year faster and faster and your best times are when 
                    you are young.&quot;<br>
