                  KEY BISCAYNE, Fla. USA<br>
                  Reuters<br>
                  26 March 2002<br>
                  <br>
                  <img src="img5/img012339.jpg" width="150" height="200" align="left">For 
                  Marat Safin there has always been more to life than tennis, 
                  and it showed on Monday when the sixth seed was almost swept 
                  out of the Nasdaq-100 Open Masters in the third round by Peruvian 
                  qualifier Luis Horna. <br>
                  <br>
                  Tennis super-stardom and a trophy case of Grand Slam titles 
                  have long been predicted for the talented Russian but do not 
                  expect Safin to become the next Pete Sampras, consumed with 
                  the sport and his place in its history. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Sure, I would love to be the next Pete and I'm doing everything 
                  possible to get there,&quot; said Safin after rallying to beat 
                  Horna 3-6 6-3 7-6 (7-3). &quot;I love tennis but I also like 
                  to enjoy my life. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;It would be a pity to spend probably the best years of 
                  my life just living with tennis. It would be the biggest mistake 
                  of my life. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I don't think you have to destroy your life because of 
                  tennis. I don't think it does any damage living your life and 
                  doing your job on the court.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  While most of the top players competing in Miami are cloistered 
                  away at the Ritz-Carlton hotel on quiet Key Biscayne, Safin 
                  has settled in amid the college Spring revellers and holidaymakers 
                  on bustling Miami Beach. <br>
                  <br>
                  To spot the 2000 U.S. Open champion strolling along Ocean Boulevard 
                  through Miami's trendy Art Deco district would not be unusual 
                  -- in fact it might be expected. <br>
                  <br>
                  The 22-year-old Russian has developed a well-deserved reputation 
                  as a fun-loving guy, his pursuit of life's more hedonistic pleasures 
                  occasionally distracting from his pursuit of tennis titles. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  STUPID TV <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;You cannot practice during a tournament, so you play one 
                  hour and a half, you go to the gym and, what do you do with 
                  the rest of the day?&quot; asked Safin, who lost in the final 
                  of this year's Australian Open to Swede Thomas Johansson. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;You stay home, watch stupid TV. That's all there is? It's 
                  boring. I want to enjoy my life.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I am living now at Miami Beach. I'm having so much fun. 
                  So why do I have to change my way of life? I love it.&quot; 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Now, not even Pete Sampras wants to be the Sampras who ruled 
                  the tennis world throughout much of the 1990s. <br>
                  <br>
                  Since his marriage to actress Bridgette Wilson last September, 
                  Sampras has seen his world ranking slip from number three to 
                  13. <br>
                  <br>
                  The 30-year-old American is in the middle of a title drought, 
                  having gone 24 tournaments without lifting a trophy. The last 
                  time was nearly two years ago when he claimed his seventh Wimbledon 
                  crown. <br>
                  <br>
                  But the man considered by many to be the greatest of all-time 
                  says he would not trade his current happiness for a return to 
                  his glorious past.<br>
                  <br>
                  Even a humbling 7-6 (7-1) 6-1 loss to Chilean qualifier Fernando 
                  Gonzalez in the third round in Miami could not faze Sampras, 
                  who was more excited about the future than the past. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;The years I was (world) number one I was probably consumed 
                  with the sport,&quot; admitted Sampras, who holds the record 
                  for weeks at number one with 286. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;It's hard to say how really happy I was. I was happy winning 
                  tournaments. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;But in order to stay up there for as long as I did, it 
                  took a lot of sacrifice. Those days are over, I've lost enough 
                  hair with all the worries and all the stress I put on myself. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I still want to get back to winning Slams and contending 
                  for majors but I'm happy now as a tennis player. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I'm married and things couldn't be better. I just wish 
                  I could be playing a little better.&quot; <br>
