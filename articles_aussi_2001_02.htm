                    <br>
                    MELBOURNE, Australia (AP)<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">The 
                    words of reigning US Open champion Marat Safin after being 
                    soundly whipped by No.14-seeded Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia 
                    6-2 7-6[6] 6-4 on Sunday in the fourth round of the Australian 
                    Open.<br>
                    <br>
                    Safin wasn't lying - he played poorly and Hrbaty, a one-time 
                    French Open semifinalist, put on an exquisite display of his 
                    own talents.<br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;I think he played very good today, I played very badly,&quot; 
                    said the No.2-seeded Safin, who possesses a remarkable aptitude 
                    for the game, but still suffers from occasional confidence 
                    lapses.<br>
                    &quot;I mean, I can't play this way being No.2 in the world. 
                    This is not my tennis. That's a little bit ridiculous what 
                    I made on the court.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    Safin, who won seven of his eight career trophies in the 2000 
                    season, didn't look like a Grand Slam champion against Hrbaty. 
                    His failing performance now put Hrbaty closer in their head-to-heads, 
                    with Safin still leading 5-4 in career meetings.<br>
                    <br>
                    A glance at the statistics shows an appalling showing for 
                    Safin - he won only 89 points to 113 for Hrbaty; he had 47 
                    unforced errors to 31 for Hrbaty; and he offered up 13 break 
                    point opportunities, a rather amazing amount considering the 
                    power of his serve, of which Hrbaty broke serve on five occasions.<br>
                    <br>
                    For Safin, who ended his trip to the Australian Open in the 
                    two hours, three minute match against Hrbaty, a lack of self-assurance 
                    was the missing element on Sunday.<br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;If you don't have confidence, you cannot play - you 
                    cannot do anything with the ball,&quot; Safin admitted, honestly. 
                    &quot;I had no confidence at all. I was playing from the baseline, 
                    which is my best game, and I just was afraid all the time.&quot;<br>
                    While Safin was quick to call attention to the fact he was 
                    not at his optimum game level, he was even quicker to compliment 
                    Hrbaty on his fabulous play. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;The guy - he wouldn't sweat,&quot; Safin said, laughing. 
                    &quot;&quot;The guy was playing very comfortable from the 
                    baseline because I was making all the work - I was running, 
                    I was making unforced errors. I think he was much better than 
                    me today.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    While Safin is the player with the noted serve, it was Hrbaty 
                    who was really impressive on that front on Sunday.<br>
                    <br>
                    He barely trailed Safin's count of 11 aces by posting seven 
                    for himself, and whereas Safin had four double faults, Hrbaty 
                    had none.<br>
                    <br>
                    Of not having any double faults in the match, Hrbaty said, 
                    &quot;I don't remember that in my life. So I was serving really 
                    well today, especially the second serve.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    As Safin leaves Melbourne to reassess what went wrong at this 
                    Australian Open and whether he needs to locate a full-time 
                    coach, he offered a parting word that Hrbaty deserved to win.<br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;I'm not the only person in this world who can lose against 
                    Hrbaty,&quot; he said. &quot;It's also you have to give a 
                    little respect to Dominik. He played great.&quot; <br>
                    Hrbaty remains behind and looks ahead to another great challenge 
                    - a quarterfinal date with Australian favorite and two-time 
                    US Open champion Patrick Rafter.<br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;It's going to be tough match, for sure, as any other 
                    match here in Grand Slam,&quot; Hrbaty said. &quot;Got a little 
                    bit different game than Marat. He's [Rafter] playing serve 
                    and volley.<br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;I have nothing to lose. He's higher seeded than me, 
                    and I will fight and try to beat him.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
