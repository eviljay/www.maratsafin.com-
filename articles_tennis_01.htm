                  by Bill Scott<br>
                  <br>
                  July 25, Rome<br>
                  <br>
                  As he crosses the Atlantic Ocean to start a summer campaign 
                  that leads to an attempt to defend his U.S. Open crown, Marat 
                  Safin is aiming to take on some of the more aggressive characteristics 
                  of the fearful Russian bear as he battles for survival on the 
                  hard courts. <br>
                  <br>
                  The power-stroking Safin is not exactly an endangered species 
                  in the pro game, but 21-year-old from Moscow is determined to 
                  fight for his life. 'I'll be tough out there,' said Safin, who 
                  is starting his campaign at the Mercedes Benz Cup in Los Angeles. 
                  'I'll go for everything -- I'll fight like a dog.' <br>
                  <br>
                  His performance may include a few tricks: 'I'll jump, I'll dive, 
                  I will be there. I'll do everything possible to win some tournaments.'<br>
                  <br>
                  Taking a page from the book of Andre Agassi's coach Brad Gilbert, 
                  the results might not be pretty, but that's not the point: 'I 
                  don't care about anything else, I just want to win. It doesn't 
                  matter how, if it's going to be an ugly match or a nice match,' 
                  he said. 'I want to beat everybody, I want to get my game like 
                  it was last year.' <br>
                  <br>
                  The Russian is carrying memories of an outstanding 2000 season 
                  in the United States. A year ago, the young talent made his 
                  breakthough on a surface where he had nurtured many doubts. 
                  The clay-bred European won the Masters Series title in Toronto, 
                  lost the final at Indianapolis to Gustavo Kuerten and then stunned 
                  Pete Sampras in three sets at Flushing Meadows to take the U.S. 
                  Open title.<br>
                  <br>
                  But the start of 2001 was not too rosy, as the contender slumped 
                  through a back injury in the closing stages of the Dubai tournament 
                  in Februry. And after a clay season to forget, Safin has slowly 
                  recovered his fitness and now is taking tentative steps back 
                  to world-class form.<br>
                  <br>
                  While his physical form is strengthening, the wild card remains 
                  in his mental form. <br>
                  <br>
                  'When you're coming back from an injury you don't have much 
                  confidence and you don't play well. I'm completely recovered 
                  -- the problem is that I don't have enough confidence to play 
                  big matches,' said the Russian.<br>
                  <br>
                  'But I'm looking ahead. I think it's going to come, but perhaps 
                  it's already too late for this year.'<br>
                  <br>
                  Like many of his countrymen, Safin exhibits a healthy dose of 
                  Russian pessimism. But it took only one Wimbledon title, for 
                  example, for Goran Ivanisevic to vault up close to the Top 10 
                  in the Champions Race earlier this month after lingering in 
                  the depths for the past 18 months. It may not even take a tennis 
                  miracle for the same to happen to Safin, who currently stands 
                  20th alongside Sampras and well within striking distance of 
                  the elite.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin called his current form 'about 60 percent' of his best. 
                  'I haven't won enough tough matches, so things can be difficult,' 
                  he explained. 'Last year I didn't have any doubts and everything 
                  was perfect: My condition was perfect and I was full of confidence. 
                  I was playing great and, actually, not many people could touch 
                  me.' <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin knows better than anyone exactly what targets he must 
                  hit if he wants to resurrect his sharp game. Last year the Russian 
                  complied a standard-setting 12-2 record heading into the Open, 
                  where he certainly was not reckoned as a serious contender, 
                  let alone an eventual champion after his unexpected demolition 
                  of Sampras. <br>
                  <br>
                  Coasting somewhat on his success, he finished last year with 
                  seven titles as No. 2 in the world behind Gustavo Kuerten. Now 
                  Safin's playing L.A. for the first time and hoping to mark a 
                  smooth transition between clay tennis and the cement. The slow 
                  clay surface ended on a high note as Safin won the Stuttgart 
                  title last week. <br>
                  <br>
                  The player and coach Mats Wilander have mapped a full schedule 
                  for August and the first half of September. After Los Angeles, 
                  Safin will travel to Montreal to defend the Canadian title he 
                  claimed over Israeli Harel Levy, then visit Cincinnati, Indianapolis 
                  and New York.<br>
                  <br>
                  With that long stretch of strength-sapping events ahead of him, 
                  Safin now knows the importance of fitness and staying in form 
                  for the long haul on the most punishing surface in the game. 
                  'I think I'm healthy and everything is perfect,' he said. 'I'm 
                  happy with this, I'm starting to play better. Of course, I will 
                  go for everything -- I want to win a tournament in America.'<br>
