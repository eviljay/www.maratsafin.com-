<P><IMG src="/Admin/spaw/DatabaseImages/allsportsafinoz05finalfist.jpg"><BR>Safin - challenging Federer's dominance (Getty Images). </P>
<P>A good a player as Roger Federer is, wasn't it good to see him beaten in Melbourne?<BR>The Swiss has proved a brilliant entertainer over the past 12 months, but even those who continue to marvel at his skills on a tennis court must have been growing tired of his domination of the game.<BR>He arrived at the Australian Open unbeaten in five months and looked like making it six as he cruised through the early rounds.<BR>Then he ran into Marat Safin.</P>
<P>The Russian has long been touted as the one player with the natural talent to challenge Federer's position as world number one, but time and again he has failed to live up to considerable promise.<BR>That was until the back end of last season when he won back-to-back Masters Series events in Madrid and Paris.<BR>Despite that form, Safin was still a big outsider before he took to the Rod Laver Arena to face Federer in a semi-final which will earn a considerable entry in the history books of Melbourne Park.<BR>Federer was unable to shake off Safin as he had done with many other opponents during the fortnight and when he blew match point in the fourth-set tie-break, you sensed something special was about to happen.<BR>Safin, so often the architect of his own downfall with a fragile mind, refused to buckle in the decider, but when he missed match point an incredible six times you wondered if the tantrums would return.<BR>Yet there were few signs of his famous temper and he eventually managed to close out a memorable victory.<BR><BR>It is Safin's mind which adds to his 'watchability'.<BR>His ability to implode has infuriated his supporters on many an occasion in the past and depite looking mentally tough in Melbourne, he still showed his frustration on many an occasion.<BR>Comparisons with John McEnroe will undoubtedly be made.<BR>Some will tut and say there is no place for such behaviour in the game. Others, including me, believe it is good for players to express their emotions on court.<BR>'Super Brat' of course made his name with his success at Wimbledon, an event he won three times.<BR>Safin seems unlikely to follow in his footsteps though, and that is sad for fans of the game in England.<BR>Last year Safin was dumped out of SW19 in the very first round, disgusted by his inability to adapt to the surface.<BR>"I give up on Wimbledon," Safin said after losing to little-known Dimitry Tursunov. "It's definitely not the tournament for me. I hate this. I was trying to prepare myself and give myself another chance but I think it's the last one."<BR>The world number four has since vowed to return to the All England Club, but despite possessing fine volleying skills - as he showed at times in the Melbourne final against Lleyton Hewitt - he admits his chances of success are slim.<BR>Even if he does show up, English tennis fans are unlikely to see that best of Safin on their grasscourts and he will therefore struggle to earn the plaudits that Federer has done in this country.<BR>With interest in tennis in England so focused on two weeks in the summer, those who only loosely follow the game will be missing out.<BR>In Melbourne, Safin showed he has all the shots and a much-talked about rivalry with Federer could well be brewing nicely in five months' time.<BR>Let's hope so.<BR><BR>A one-man domination of any sport may be fascinating in the short term, but as time goes by it can border on the tedious - Pete Sampras wasn't just tagged 'boring' for his off-court demeanour.<BR>As good as it would have been to have seen a player complete the Grand Slam, something which hasn't happened in my lifetime on the men's side, I'm looking forward to the season more now than I did prior to Safin's memorable victory.</P>
