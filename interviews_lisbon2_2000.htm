                    <br>
                    ATP: Questions for Marat. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How would you compare the way you played today with last 
                    night?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: How I play today compares to yesterday? <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Yes. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Way better. I didn't serve well today because 
                    I was twice a break up in the second set, and I made very 
                    easy mistakes. I lost my game without any chances. Actually, 
                    I'm satisfied with my baseline. Sometimes I didn't work enough 
                    with my legs. I was too lazy. But actually, I played quite 
                    well. Yesterday I was completely lost on the court, except 
                    the third set when I start to build my game again. I hope 
                    I will not make the same mistakes like yesterday and like 
                    today, a break up in the second set against Pete, you cannot 
                    play like this. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. To have two very important tasks in front of you, the year 
                    No. 1 and reaching the semifinals here, does it have influence 
                    on your play? It makes you excited a little bit?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Excited? I don't think it's very exciting to 
                    play against Pete. For sure it is not very exciting. For the 
                    people, yes. But for me, to go from one corner to another 
                    one, try to take his serve, I don't think is the most beautiful 
                    job in the world. That's my job; I have to do this. It's very 
                    nice because I am fighting for the place in the semifinal 
                    and also for No. 1. But you never know because Pete is the 
                    best player in the world. But I will have to work a little 
                    bit more tomorrow, day after. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Going to play Pete after the US Open final, is the feeling 
                    that you're going to have a mental edge or do you feel the 
                    pressure that you're going to have to prove it again?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I think it's completely different story. The 
                    way I played in the final of US Open, I will never play again 
                    the same tennis. It's impossible. I mean, to beat Pete in 
                    the final of US Open in front of 20,000 people, playing my 
                    best tennis without any breaks, I mean, it's unbelievable. 
                    But here, I mean, Pete is getting better and better each day. 
                    Tomorrow he will be very tough, I'm sure. But, for sure, I 
                    will have more opportunities. If I'll be able to take them, 
                    I can win. If not, I going to lose (smiling). <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What gives you the most joy in playing tennis? What do 
                    you most like about playing tennis? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: If you ask me the same question when I was six, 
                    I will tell you, "I hate this game." But now I think I'm enjoying 
                    this. Actually, is not a game, is a job already. A game it 
                    was when I was ten, when I was nine. Now is a part of my life. 
                    I'm spending during all the year traveling all over the world 
                    playing for the people. But, of course, enjoying this job.Thanks 
                    a lot to my parents to push me there because otherwise I have 
                    no future in other sports, for sure. Here, especially now, 
                    I never enjoyed my life more than today, these two weeks. 
                    I'm very satisfied with my life. Thanks a lot to tennis. I'm 
                    here talking to you. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Could you talk a little bit about what it's like playing 
                    against Lleyton Hewitt, and what do you think of his chances 
                    in the rest of the tournament? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Lleyton, I think he's playing probably his best 
                    tennis. Today I played very good. I played, I don't know, 
                    close to perfect. He was a little bit unlucky on some points. 
                    But I think he has very good chances because the way he played 
                    against Pete, I mean, it was unbelievable how he returned 
                    his serve. I mean, Lleyton is very fast. You have to play 
                    point by point to beat him. He doesn't miss at all. He's serving 
                    aces. He can play from the baseline. He goes to the net. I 
                    think he has very good chances. I think he can beat Alex. 
                    But you never know, because Alex, he played very good against 
                    me. I was lucky there also. I mean, Alex, he was a set and 
                    5-3 serve. Today he was also another day unlucky, two set 
                    points, 15-40, five breakpoints in the second set. I think 
                    it's going to be tough match tomorrow. But I'm sure Lleyton, 
                    he going to be in Top 10 for long time. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. If you leave Lisbon as No. 1, it is your best Christmas 
                    gift? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I don't know what can be better than this. I 
                    don't know. For sure is going to be the best present, best 
                    gift to myself. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What present will you ask Santa Claus for Christmas? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: We don't count this, no, No. 1? I have so many 
                    things in my head. Let's say one more car, which one I am 
                    waiting for from Mercedes, which one I ordered already. I 
                    told you the story. I supposed to pick up it on the week of 
                    Stuttgart. Two days after, we called there, we asked, "What 
                    happened with the car?" Just the car has disappeared from 
                    the factory. So I ordered another one. I hope it's going to 
                    be ready for Christmas. That's going to be one of the second 
                    best gift for me. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Do you sense that you and Lleyton Hewitt are going to strike 
                    up a rivalry in the next five, six, seven, eight years to 
                    stand alongside rivalries like Sampras and Agassi? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: It will be nice. It will be really nice. I don't 
                    think is going to be another -- I hope I'm going to be wrong. 
                    It's not nice to talk about yourself what I'm going to say 
                    now. What Pete and Andre, they did for tennis, I mean, that's 
                    huge. It would be great is going to be another two guys who 
                    going to take their places. Who going to be there? I don't 
                    know. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. At the moment, it's a fair bet it's going to be you and 
                    Lleyton. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: It will be great. But you never knows. <br>
