                    <br>
                    MODERATOR: Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen. Marat Safin. 
                    First question, please.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How disappointing is that, the way it went today? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Quite a lot because I expected to have more chances 
                    on his serve. He was too good today. I couldn't do anything 
                    special to beat him.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Will you agree with me if I say that your performance today, 
                    or just in general at Wimbledon, was quite successful? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, it's successful, but you always expect 
                    something more, I think. Because let's say we had quite a 
                    good draw. Sampras is out. So it's Federer or Henman. It's 
                    not Sampras. If Sampras in semifinals, it's very difficult 
                    to beat him, you know. <br>
                    Goran, he was playing unbelievable. I just -- you can see 
                    you have your possibilities to be even in the final, and then 
                    suddenly it just goes away in the quarterfinals. For me is 
                    not a great result for me. Quarterfinal, yeah, it's okay. 
                    But it's not a big thing for me.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What happened in the game at 5-All in the second set? You 
                    lose your serve for the first time of the match. It seems 
                    that you maybe were too patient. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, because, you know, I didn't expect that 
                    he going to play from the baseline because normally not many 
                    people, they can play from the baseline on grass. I just try 
                    to keep the ball inside. I think it's too secure, no? Is not 
                    going this way on grass court. <br>
                    You know, it's very difficult because during all the week 
                    I played on small courts. I already start to play serve and 
                    volley. I was doing quite okay. And suddenly, they put you 
                    on centre court finally - thanks a lot to the tournament - 
                    and it's very difficult to play because it's too wide. If 
                    you make serve and volley, sometimes you don't know where 
                    to run because it's so big. It's very difficult to find your 
                    game. <br>
                    The first two sets, I was a little bit out of the game. Third 
                    set I start to return the serve already. I make a break. I 
                    had a chance to break him in the set. Let's say I played last 
                    two sets, because I started to return. I stand two meters 
                    behind the court, you know, for serves. I think that's also 
                    the reason that you're not used to play on so wide courts. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You had two tiebreaks that ran away from you a bit. Would 
                    you like to comment on what went wrong in those? You lost 
                    them, but what went wrong in the two tiebreaks, in particular?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I didn't lost them. I just had no chance. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. No chance?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: You can see statistic. How many aces he make 
                    in the tiebreak? How many first serve he put inside in tiebreak? 
                    How you can play against the guy? Is too much pressure. If 
                    you don't make your serve, make your two points, then is coming 
                    two aces. If not two aces, the second serve can be, I don't 
                    know, whatever. <br>
                    It's difficult to play against this kind of guys, you know. 
                    You expect too much from them, and it's the way it is. Three 
                    aces in the tiebreak, one return, perfect volley, that's it, 
                    7-2. Very fast. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You didn't lose your nerves during the match. Was it because 
                    it was the first time on the Centre Court of Wimbledon?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I was scared (smiling). No, just because I knew 
                    what I had to do on the court, you know. You have to be patient, 
                    these kind of players. You cannot just go and do things on 
                    the court because this kind of players, you have to be concentrate 
                    all the time because you have not many chances to break him. 
                    Every single point is a chance. You know, second serve is 
                    a big chance, huge chance. 15-30, second serve, if you don't 
                    make it...<br>
                    So it's like try to stay there on the match, try to play. 
                    He was too good. I can't say anything. I think I played okay, 
                    I played good, you know. No chance. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Do you think he can win the title now?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: If he plays like he played today, I think he 
                    will not have any problems. Guys, come on, he beat Rusedski, 
                    he beat me. Also, I know how to play tennis, you know. The 
                    guy, he just doesn't give any chances, and that's the case. 
                    The guy, if he has a second serve, he make you an ace. All 
                    the time you're under pressure. When it's tiebreak arrives, 
                    if you make three points, you are lucky. Come on, very good. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You think the quality of his second serve is almost as 
                    important as the first serve?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, yeah, because he doesn't give you -- it's 
                    difficult to return even second serve. It's very difficult. 
                    If I think Goran plays this way, the way he played today, 
                    if he doesn't win the title, I'll be really pissed with him. 
                    He can't lose this opportunity because I don't think he played 
                    this way like when he was in the final three times. Now he's 
                    playing the best tennis he could play. If he doesn't win, 
                    we'll change my mind about him (smiling). <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Bearing in mind that you have the same manager with Ivanisevic, 
                    have you ever trained with him? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Not many times. Maybe two, three times in all 
                    my career. Doesn't mean anything, actually. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How far do you think you are from your best level of last 
                    year now? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I'm getting closer. Yeah, I think I'm playing 
                    okay. Now I think I'm ready for the States. I'm playing quite 
                    good, serving well, I have no problems in my back. Yeah, I'm 
                    improving. I'm satisfied with the way I'm playing. I'm happy 
                    that Mats still wants to coach me. Yes, I'll be okay for States. 
                    I'm ready.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Are you a little bit pleased that you have lots of points 
                    coming up? You got some points here. Does it make it a little 
                    easier for the summer?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, it's okay. Yeah, it's perfect. I don't 
                    drop too much after US Open. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Are you surprised how well Goran's playing, considering 
                    his record over the last few months?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: If I'm surprised the way he plays? Of course, 
                    everybody's surprised. I mean, the guy, he was struggling 
                    for last two years, to be honest, no? He drop from Top 20 
                    to 125, Goran's ranking is. <br>
                    He lost to Caratti in Queen's. I mean, Caratti is not a bad 
                    player, but Goran, I think he should win this match, no? The 
                    way he's playing now, it's like he's back in Top 10, really 
                    close to 1, 2 in the world. Of course I surprised. 1, 2 in 
                    the world, you have no chance probably, no? He's playing this 
                    way. Because with other people, you have chance always. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Have you never felt so frustrated on a tennis court as 
                    today?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I was as frustrated in the French Open against 
                    Santoro. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. I was thinking in the sense you say you just didn't feel 
                    you had a chance against the serve, there was nothing there 
                    for you today. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, I have no chance. What can I do? You cannot 
                    do anything against this. I mean, I'd be more frustrated if 
                    I would have huge chance and I don't take it. What I had, 
                    I took. Break, I took it, that's it.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Do you think even Agassi might have a chance?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Check the score, he's losing now, Agassi. There 
                    is also another player. Escude I think is a great player. 
                    Doesn't mean if his name is Agassi, he going to be in the 
                    final. So let's put it the way it is actually.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    </font> 
                </td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <br>
            <br>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </td>
    <td width="34" align="center" valign="top"><br>
      <br>
      <img src="img/a_int.gif" width="33" height="272"> </td>
  </tr>
</table>
<br>

</body>
