                    <b>MODERATOR: 
                    </b>Questions for Marat.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> You finally got by in three sets. Does it feel good?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yes.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> You've had to work pretty hard to get here. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Of course. I passed one match from four 
                    sets and two matches in five sets. The last one was in the 
                    tiebreak. I was lucky to win two days ago, so now I was lucky 
                    to win this match so easy. I think if you work very hard, 
                    you have a difficult match definitely in every tournament. 
                    I hope it was two days ago. I hope it will never happened 
                    again to me. I hope also that it's going to be much more easier. 
                    I'm not sure, but I hope so, that I can play much, much better 
                    than I played two days ago, like I played today, so I can 
                    have some chances at least to be in the final. I said already 
                    that I'm not coming here to make fourth round, not quarters, 
                    not semifinal, I came here to win, and I'm going to do everything 
                    to do this. If somebody going to be better than me, I have 
                    no problems with it. But I'm here to fight, to win this tournament. 
                    So if I play like this, I can do it. I think so. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Did you play very, very well today, and did he also 
                    play pretty bad?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah. I think because you cannot describe 
                    with other words. I think he played not his best tennis, for 
                    sure. Also, I mean, three sets, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2, it means something 
                    that I also can play tennis, and I can play very good. So 
                    it's not only his fault that he didn't play well. Yes, that's 
                    true also. But you have to say also that I served well, I 
                    didn't let him play since the beginning. I played very good 
                    from the baseline. Also I didn't let him play. I didn't let 
                    him to make his game, which was very important since the beginning, 
                    just to start to put pressure on him. Otherwise, it's very 
                    difficult to beat him if he's playing his game because he's 
                    very fast player, very good hands, and he's always played 
                    two, three shots. It's always difficult. He played very good 
                    also. He opened very good angles. If he's in good shape, it's 
                    no chance to beat him. So I did my job. I didn't let him play. 
                    That's it. That's why I think he couldn't play, he couldn't 
                    play better. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Is it difficult to play a fourth round match at 
                    a Grand Slam in a very empty stadium like that? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> If I would be a spectator, I would go 
                    home not because of the match, maybe because it's too cold 
                    to stay there definitely. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Is it disappointing for you as a player to have 
                    so few people? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I don't care. Of course it's much more 
                    fun to play with a lot of spectators. But if I win 6-1, 6-2, 
                    6-2 without the spectators, it doesn't bother me. I think 
                    the spectators, they have some other things to do. I think 
                    if they're not here, they have to be somewhere, no?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Do you feel at this stage that the fast hard courts 
                    suit you even better than the clay? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Two years ago, everybody told me that 
                    I can play only on clay. Now the people, they say I play better 
                    on hard. It's means that I can play everywhere, not because 
                    I'm 6 in the world. It means that I won two tournaments on 
                    clay, so I can play there also. I won one Super 9 on hard 
                    court, so I can play also on hard court. I can't play yet 
                    on grass, but I'm working for this. I think I need a little 
                    bit more of experience. If you propose to yourself something, 
                    I think you can get -- maybe when I'm going to be 30, I will 
                    play better on grass. At least I'm trying. Definitely I can 
                    play on clay, and I'm not playing very bad if I'm also in 
                    quarters at US Open. So you decide.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>What surface do you prefer?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN</b>: Okay, like this? You build the question 
                    like this (laughter)? Doesn't matter. When you're playing 
                    good, you can play everywhere, I think. When you are out of 
                    shape, you cannot play anywhere. If it's clay, there is a 
                    lot of bad bounces. If it's hard court, it's very fast. You 
                    cannot find the best surface when you're playing bad. But 
                    if you're playing good, you can play everywhere. Not yet on 
                    grass, but I hope next year. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Did you bring with you today a lot of socks, shorts, 
                    shirts?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah. I get a lot of stuff here. I hope 
                    I will do it next day the same, to be a little bit more professional. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Do you think you had the problems on Sunday because 
                    you don't have the proper coach to take care of your shorts 
                    and your socks? Is that the problem? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Because I make the five sets? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> No, because you had problems with your socks and 
                    shorts. If you had a full-time coach, he could take care of 
                    that.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, I think I need the coach definitely 
                    for this only (laughter). <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> What is the difference between having Chesnokov 
                    and Volkov as coach? What is the main difference between the 
                    two guys?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>I cannot say because if I said bad about 
                    Chesnokov, he going to kill me, otherwise Volkov going to 
                    kill me. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Give the good points of both, if there are.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Of course. Of course. Let me think. I 
                    think Chesnokov, he's a hard worker, definitely. I mean, he 
                    can run thousands of kilometers on the court. He was a big 
                    fighter, not so much talent like Alexander. Alexander, he 
                    live in a different world. He can see the tennis from other 
                    dimension. Nobody can understand tennis like him. For him, 
                    tennis is very simple - too simple. Did you ever seen him 
                    play?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Yes. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I mean, the guy, he never move. You see 
                    the court, how can he get these balls? It's amazing. He make 
                    the tennis very simple for him. I don't know if it's the job 
                    of his coach. If it's his coach, it's unbelievable. If you 
                    make the guy so good, you take from the guy so much talent. 
                    For him, if he can explain to you about tennis, tennis is 
                    so simple. There's just different vision of tennis. Andrei 
                    is just a hard worker. He just show you how to work, how to 
                    be professional. Alexander, how to make tennis much more easier. 
                    I think I'm right. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Is it simple for you to understand what he says? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> From the beginning, I couldn't understand 
                    him. What are you talking about? Now I start to understand. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Can you talk about your mental development since 
                    Roland Garros, where you lost a very tough match, to where 
                    you are right now, and whether you think you can win a big 
                    match two days from now, four days from now?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think I'm the same like it was in Roland 
                    Garros. I just getting a little bit more of experience each 
                    time I'm playing. I'm much more stable on the court. I can 
                    play, I can realize situation when I'm in the fifth set. I 
                    can play tennis. I'm not going crazy. I'm not breaking any 
                    more racquets. It just help me a lot to be hundred percent 
                    concentrate on the court. In Roland Garros I wasn't the way 
                    to where I am now. Now is another level. I have to step to 
                    another level if I want to be better than now. Just you have 
                    to build something more. You need something new, you have 
                    to work on your mentality definitely. It's not the end; it's 
                    just the beginning to where I want to be. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Where do you want to be? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I impressed you, huh? Also myself (laughter). 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Where do you want to be, Marat?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> If it's possible, if the God will let 
                    me, No. 1 in the world. Why not? I am 6. I think is not enough. 
                    If the people will let me, I will be there. Otherwise I will 
                    be satisfied with No. 2 - but I will fight for it, for No. 
                    1. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Do you think you'd be satisfied with No. 2?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No. But if the people will not let me, 
                    I have to be satisfied with No. 2. Right now I want to be 
                    No. 1. When it's going to be my time, I will try to do this.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Pete Sampras said earlier in the tournament when 
                    he wanted to be No. 1, it took absolute commitment of his 
                    entire life, he had to move away from his family. He said 
                    he didn't really see anybody else on tour who he thought could 
                    become a dominating No. 1, didn't see anybody who he felt 
                    had that great level of commitment. Do you think you have 
                    it in you to do it? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think so. But we'll see - we'll see 
                    (smiling). Not this year, because there's other guys like 
                    Kuerten, like Norman, they start to play tennis from January. 
                    I start to play tennis from April. Four months, five months 
                    even, it's difficult now to think about No. 1. Next year we 
                    can talk about this. I hope I will start from January like 
                    normal person, normal tennis player - not like somebody somewhere 
                    who starts from April.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> It just has been a while since I heard a young player 
                    say, "I want to be No. 1." Kafelnikov at one point said, "I'm 
                    tired of being No. 1."<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> And you believe him? You think we are 
                    stupid here on ATP Tour? Everybody wants to be No. 1. Is only 
                    15 or 16 guys that were No. 1 in the world. How many?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>GREG SHARKO:</b> 17. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> 17, sorry. It must be tough to get there. 
                    But definitely I'm a hundred percent sure you can take everybody 
                    to the same question, "Do you want to be No. 1 in the world?" 
                    I don't think they're going to say, "No, no, no, I don't need 
                    this." Of course, they will say yes, I'm sure. If you say 
                    no, it's because you are too nice guy. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> This is the first time that you're the favorite 
                    on your side of the draw. How does that feel? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Nothing. I don't feel anything. There's 
                    how many, three more guys who wants to be in the final. Martin 
                    is playing unbelievable tennis. Kiefer, he beat Norman. I 
                    think is a huge win. Johansson, he beat Arthurs with probably 
                    the best serve on ATP Tour. Everybody's playing good tennis 
                    if they're in quarterfinals. So is nothing. Just for spectators, 
                    for the fans, for you guys. You can say that somebody's a 
                    favorite. But it's a little bit different story in the locker 
                    room because we know each other, we know how we are playing. 
                    Even the guy who is 100 in the world, he can be in the final. 
                    You just have to make your job. Next round I play against 
                    Kiefer. I have to respect him. After this, if I will beat 
                    him, we can talk about other two guys. Favorite, it's just 
                    a word, nothing more. Nice word to me. Thank you very much.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> You've played Kiefer before, you've beaten him. 
                    At what level will you have to play to beat him? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Like I said before, he's in the forefront. 
                    He beat Magnus Norman. It's a huge win. To beat Magnus, he's 
                    a big fighter. He beat him in four sets. It means he's playing 
                    great tennis. But I can also play good tennis. The question 
                    is, who going to start better? Who going to be less nervous 
                    since the beginning? Who going to make his game first? Who 
                    going to build his game as soon as possible in the first two 
                    games? You have to build your game already. You have to make 
                    your tactic. If you can make it, you can beat him. If you 
                    don't make it, you have to fight, definitely. The problem 
                    is you have to build your game very fast, don't let him play 
                    because he's on good conditions. If you let him play, it's 
                    very difficult to come back. It's very tough. If you don't 
                    want to have a headache on this game, you have to build very 
                    fast your game, make your tactic, hold your serve and put 
                    pressure. That's it. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> You keep telling us that you don't want to break 
                    any more racquets. Against Pozzi, you were very close to breaking 
                    one. When did you break actually the last one?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> The last one? Against Guardiola. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Not a long time ago?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No (laughter). <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> You've changed the last few days?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I become a good player. <br>
