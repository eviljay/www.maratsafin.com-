                  <b>The 2000 tennis season is now officially over and what a 
                  season it was. Eurosport would like to honor those players who 
                  have engraved their name in tennis history books forever, those 
                  players who have made us remember what a grand sport tennis 
                  is and whose charm and personality will never be forgotten.</b>

                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>BEST PLAYER OF THE YEAR </b><br>
                  Without any doubt the best player of the year award, on the 
                  men’s side, goes to Brazil’s Gustavo Kuerten for his amazing 
                  year. Winning a total of 5 titles which includes his second 
                  Roland Garros crown, Guga won the Grand Slam after 11 match 
                  points in a tough battle against Magnus Norman. His participation 
                  in the year end Masters Cup was the best of all as he did the 
                  impossible: he beat the odds and took the number one spot from 
                  Russia’s Marat Safin by winning the title and becoming the first 
                  South American player to achieve this honour.<br>
                  <br>
                  On the women’s side, even though Martina Hingis finished the 
                  year as number 1, no other player deserves this award more than 
                  Venus Williams. Venus came from behind and showed the tennis 
                  world that she has what it takes, setting a 35 match winning 
                  streak. She won a total of 5 tour titles and two Olympic gold 
                  medals. Among her tour titles we can find Wimbledon and the 
                  US Open were the defending champion was her sister, Serena. 
                  Venus travelled to Sydney for the Olympics, winning the singles 
                  title and sharing the doubles with Serena, at a Games which 
                  proved a triumph for a vibrant and confident player. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>BEST ACHIEVEMENT </b><br>
                  Marat Safinbecame the most watched player this year as his strenghth 
                  and determination made him overcome the biggest challenges. 
                  Winning a total of 7 titles during the year, Marat’s bigggest 
                  moment was at the US Open final when he defeated the player 
                  of the decade, Pete Sampras. Safin made the year end Masters 
                  Cup as the player to beat after having won two Matsers series 
                  titles in Toronto and in Paris where he gave an incredible performance 
                  in the final against Philippoussis after having gashed his right 
                  eyebrow. <br>
                  <br>
                  France’s Mary Pierce will take home the achievement award as 
                  she stunned the tennis world by winning her second Grand Slam 
                  title of her career: the French Open. She made the dream of 
                  any athlete come true, to win an important title on home-ground. 
                  After being absent from the courts Mary gave a superb performance, 
                  beating along the way her doubles partner Martina Hingis in 
                  a match that will stay in everybody’s mind for a long time. 
                  She produced one of the most amazing shots ever done by a women, 
                  a return volley in between her legs. <br>
                  <b><br>
                  REVELATION OF THE YEAR </b><br>
                  Spain’s Juan Carlos Ferrero led his country to their first Davis 
                  Cup title earning the title of “King Juan Carlos” by his Spanish 
                  fans. He reached his first Grand Slam semi-final at the French 
                  Open and proved once more that he will be a tough contender 
                  for years to come.<br>
                  <br>
                  Kim Clijsters of Belgium took the tennis stage this year and 
                  managed to attract the attention of the media. She won a total 
                  of 2 titles and became a nightmare for the highest ranked players. 
                  Her ranking progression was very impressive, beginning the year 
                  as number 47 and finishing as number 18. She led her team in 
                  the Fed Cup finals and defended the honour of her country as 
                  no other player has done. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>BEST PROGRESSION </b><br>
                  At the beginning of the season he was an unknown but promissing 
                  player in 87th position. Later on he crashed and reached 127th 
                  position. Little by little his concentration and determination 
                  helped put his game together and he began to fly through the 
                  rankings. By May 22nd he was already among the top ten and swiftly 
                  continued his progression. On September 18th he reached the 
                  number one spot for the first time and traded places with Gustavo 
                  Kuerten until the end of the season. Russia’s Marat Safin stunned 
                  the tennis world with a growing confidence that helped him overcome 
                  all the obtacles he faced on his way to glory. <br>
                  <br>
                  She has been compared to Steffi Graff, she started the year 
                  ranked 62nd and began to make her move by reaching the final 
                  four at Indian Wells in March. Others began to take notice during 
                  the summer when she made a semi-final appearance in Los Angeles 
                  before reaching the final four at the U.S. Open in September. 
                  Demure and soft-spoken, Elena Dementieva possesses an air of 
                  quiet confidence that has grown with each new hurdle cleared. 
                  The highlight for Dementieva came when she took home a silver 
                  medal from the Sydney Olympics, beating everyone she faced except 
                  Venus Williams. She finished the year as number 12 and her goal 
                  for next year is to dethrone Martina Hingis. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>BEST DRESSED (FASHION AWARD)</b> <br>
                  Without any doubt and by far the Williams sisters have dominated 
                  tennis fashion this year. With their extravagant outfits and 
                  hair do’s on and off the courts, Serena and Venus have always 
                  tried to be orginal designing their own outfits and wearing 
                  out of the ordinary attires. Their matching hair do and shoes 
                  have made them a fashion frenzy on the tennis courts. This is 
                  the first time in tennis history that fashion has become a “must” 
                  when going on the court. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>SEXIEST PLAYER </b><br>
                  Spanish players have always been somewhat attractive and sexy. 
                  This year Carlos Moya is said to be the sexiest player on the 
                  tour. His long hair, his personality and his amazing body attracted 
                  the attention of spanish director Santiago Segura, who gave 
                  him a role in his latest movie, Torrente 2. Now as a movie star 
                  and a tennis player, Carlos is known worldwide but this has 
                  not affected his attitude as he is still a sweet and caring 
                  guy. He is currently dating a spanish comentator named Patricia 
                  Conde but he still hasn’t tied the knot. So all you Moya fans, 
                  you can still attract this cute guy’s attention and who knows, 
                  maybe you will become the future miss Moya. <br>
                  <br>
                  She is a gorgeous long haired blond, blue eyes and with an exquisit 
                  body. She has become the most photographed athlete ever and 
                  she has charmed tennis fans all over the world. The minute Anna 
                  Kournikova walks on the court, the eyes of every man point at 
                  her. Her amazing moves and dazzling looks have made people forget 
                  she is a tennis player. But after her performance at the year 
                  end championship she has prooved that she is more than a pretty 
                  girl. We salute Anna for combining her exquisite looks with 
                  her astonishing tennis abilities. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>BEST TEAM </b><br>
                  This year the team cups, Davis and Fed Cup, have been filled 
                  with excitement. Many countries particpated and only a few were 
                  noticed and honored. Spain and the United States have been recognised 
                  as the best teams of the year. In this year’s final of the Davis 
                  Cup, there is no doubt that Spain takes the honour. They accomplished 
                  the unthinkable, thrashing Australia 3/1 and winning their first 
                  Davis Cup title ever. Led by captain Javier Duarte, Juan Carlos 
                  Ferrero, Alex Corretja, Juan Balcells and Albert Costa defended 
                  their flag colors and made every single Spanish citizen feel 
                  proud. Victory over the Australian defending champions in front 
                  of 14,000 screaming fans at the Palau Sant Jordi in Barcelona 
                  made Spain only the 10th nation to win the tournament in its 
                  100-year history. <br>
                  <br>
                  The United States gained a measure of sweet revenge from a gut-wrenching 
                  Fed Cup defeat, to Spain in 1998, by sweeping to a 5-0 victory 
                  to capture the 2000 Fed Cup title. Lead by Billi Jean King, 
                  the American heroes, Lindsay Davenport, Jennifer Capriati, Monica 
                  Seles and Lisa Raymond showed their red, blue and white pride, 
                  leading their country to their second consecutive title and 
                  17th overall. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>BEST MATCH </b><br>
                  All throughout the season there have been many matches that 
                  will be remembered but there is one match in particular that 
                  will never be forgotten. Paris: Palais Omnisport Bercy where 
                  the Paris Masters takes place. The best tennis players have 
                  gathered here to win a place in the season-ending Masters Cup 
                  in Lisbon. Among the players, 20-year-old Marat Safin, the world 
                  number one, and 24-year-old Mark Philippoussis. Both players 
                  faced each other in the final fight for the title. Safin cut 
                  himself above the right eye when he hit himself with his own 
                  racket attempting a diving volley mid-way through the third 
                  set. He resumed after being treated by a doctor at courtside 
                  -- and promptly broke Philippoussis serve to take the set. He 
                  needed ice on the injury to keep down the swelling but finally 
                  won in three hours 28 minutes on his sixth match point despite 
                  being battered and bloodied. The pair slugged it out for three 
                  hours 17 minutes before it came down to the tie-breaker. Safin 
                  served 22 aces and Philippoussis 21 as the pair traded shots. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>LONGEST MATCH The ATP </b><br>
                  Tour has a tradition in offering us very long and exciting matches. 
                  This year was not an exception. During the Grand Slam season 
                  we tend to see five hour long matches as both players give their 
                  best to reach the following round. In this year’s Wimbledon 
                  we witnessed the longest and most stressful match of the season. 
                  Third round of the tournament and Mark Philippoussis faced Sjeng 
                  Schalken from the Netherlands in a 5 set match that lasted four 
                  hours and 51 minutes. The match took off rapidly as both players 
                  evened the match to one set all in one hour and four minutes. 
                  One hour and 32 minutes later the match was leveled again as 
                  both players gasped for air and searched for some extra energy 
                  that would help them finish the match. The fifth and final set 
                  lasted a record time of two hours and 15 minutes with a score 
                  of 20/18 in favour of Philippoussis. Philippoussis advanced 
                  to the next round were he faced Agassi and was eventually eliminated.<br>

                  A special ovation to Pete Sampras who, this year, won a record 
                  13th grand slam title on the Wimbledon grass, gaining the title 
                  of player of the decade. He defeated Australian Pat Rafter in 
                  four sets, watched by parents who steadfastly avoided the media. 
                  Pete is known as a perfectionist and no other player in history 
                  has won as many titles as he has since the 60?s. He has reached 
                  the top of his game with a combination of strength and skill 
                  that no other player has ever had. The key to his game is his 
                  serve which is extremely powerful on fast surfaces, especially 
                  on the grass at Wimbledon. Pete Sampras has indelibly written 
                  his name on the pages of tennis history and it will be hard 
                  for any player to try and even his accomplishments.<br>
                  <br>
                  The next meeting will be January 1st 2001 when the season begins, 
                  hoping that it will bring us as much of excitement as the year 
                  2000 has.<br>
