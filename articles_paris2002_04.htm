                  Monday November 4, 2002<br>
                  <a href="http://sport.guardian.co.uk/" target="_blank">The Guardian 
                  </a><br>
                  <i><br>
                  The Russian fulfils his potential with a crushing victory over 
                  No1 Hewitt.</i><br>
                  <br>
                  Marat Safin joined the illustrious trio of Andre Agassi, Pete 
                  Sampras and Boris Becker when he won his second Paris Indoor 
                  Open title here at Bercy yesterday, defeating the Australian 
                  world No1 Lleyton Hewitt 7-6, 6-0, 6-4. <br>
                  <br>
                  It was the 22-year-old Russian's first title for 15 months, 
                  and a final too far for Hewitt, 21, whose recurring virus problems 
                  have undoubtedly affected his play since he was beaten in the 
                  US Open semi- final by Agassi in September.<br>
                  <br>
                  The last time Hewitt lost a five-set match in straight sets 
                  was in the 2001 French Open when he was beaten by Spain's Juan 
                  Carlos Ferrero, and nobody had taken a set off him to love since 
                  the Italian Open two years ago. But at least his efforts over 
                  the past week appear to have ensured that he will retain his 
                  position as the world's leading player at the end of the season. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The year's final tournament, the Tennis Masters Cup, begins 
                  in Shanghai a week tomorrow with Hewitt holding a substantial 
                  points lead over Agassi, his only rival for the top spot. And 
                  if Hewitt gets to the final in China, Agassi cannot overtake 
                  him, even if he beats him. &quot;I think Lleyton will be the 
                  world No1, and he deserves to be,&quot; said Safin. <br>
                  <br>
                  Before yesterday the Russian's year had been one of missed chances, 
                  none more so than in Melbourne last January when he lost to 
                  Sweden's Thomas Johansson in the Australian Open final. Had 
                  he won there Safin, the US Open champion in 2000, might well 
                  have gone on to dominate the game, but his confidence deserted 
                  him and, try as he might, he could not add to his previous 10 
                  career titles. That is, until yesterday. <br>
                  <br>
                  Autumn in Paris, when the boulevards are thick with fallen leaves, 
                  appears to bring out the best in Safin, for this was his third 
                  final at the Palais Omnisport in the past four years. And Australians 
                  are good for him too. Having lost to Agassi in 1999, he defeated 
                  Melbourne's Mark Philippoussis the next year, although that 
                  victory needed a tie-breaker in the fifth set. <br>
                  <br>
                  Becker, with three Paris Open Indoor titles, remains top of 
                  the list, with Safin now snuggling up with Agassi and Sampras, 
                  all with two. Perhaps, like that trio, Safin will win Wimbledon 
                  one day. Nothing is beyond the compass of this young man's power 
                  and talent. The one doubt is his temperament, although on this 
                  occasion he was calmness personified. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;You know Lleyton will fight and fight and fight until 
                  you break. If you show him that you are broken, the match is 
                  finished,&quot; said Safin, who will return to this stadium 
                  at the end of the month when Russia play France in the Davis 
                  Cup final. The only differences will be the surface, which will 
                  be clay, and the level of crowd support against him. <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin's is a high-risk game, because he rarely goes for percentage 
                  shots. This may change as the years pass, but for the moment 
                  he is very much dependent on confidence, and when he arrived 
                  in Paris it was not terribly high. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I was frustrated. I felt I was almost there, but finally 
                  I have done it. It was a big present from Lleyton.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  If this was an acknowledgement that Hewitt was some way short 
                  of his best, it was a view that Hewitt confirmed. &quot;My expectations 
                  were not that high this week, and if I hadn't been playing for 
                  No1 the chances are I probably would not have come. I had to 
                  try and get some runs on the board, which obviously gives me 
                  a little more confidence going into Shanghai.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  Not that it was a gimme for Safin. The two had met six times 
                  previously and were tied at 3-3. The Russian has been striving 
                  for greater variation in his serve but, when he squandered a 
                  break in the opening set to allow Hewitt back from 3-1 down, 
                  it appeared the old inconsistencies were resurfacing. &quot;I 
                  had a lot of chances to get back into the match but when you 
                  give Marat a start he's very tough to peg back,&quot; said Hewitt, 
                  referring to the loss of that first set. <br>
                  <br>
                  Thereafter Hewitt's resistance was little more than cosmetic. 
                  &quot;I think the second set was just perfect for me,&quot; 
                  said Safin, who appears likely to finish the year as the world 
                  No3, having dropped out of the top 10 last year. &quot;Sometimes 
                  you have great days, some days are a little more difficult. 
                  But I'm enjoying my sport and I'm happy to be here in Paris 
                  instead of cleaning the streets in Moscow. It's wonderful to 
                  win again, especially at the end of the season.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  Cedric Pioline announced his retirement from the sport at 33 
                  after he and Gustavo Kuerten lost the doubles final. Pioline 
                  reached two grand slam finals, losing to Pete Sampras in the 
                  US Open in 1993 and again at Wimbledon in 1997. He was also 
                  part of two French Davis Cup triumphs. <br>

                  November 04, 2002 <br>
                  From Neil Harman, Tennis Correspondent in Paris <br>
                  <br>
                  <i>Safin finds his best form to put Hewitt on the run.</i><br>
                  <br>
                  IT WILL be a lot different the next time Marat Safin takes to 
                  the twisting staircases of the Palais Omnisports de Bercy. Yesterday, 
                  he was the star of the show. In 26 days’ time, he will be the 
                  sworn enemy and the teeth of the French will be bared to him. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin claimed his first tournament title in 13 months when he 
                  drove ever-widening holes through the famed defences of Lleyton 
                  Hewitt, the Wimbledon champion, to win the ninth and final Masters 
                  Series event of the year, the BNP Paribas-sponsored event here, 
                  in a manner that recalled his sustained brilliance at the US 
                  Open in 2000. <br>
                  <br>
                  How the French devoured his every move, for there is something 
                  about this enigmatic Cossack that finds favour with the most 
                  discerning palate. He knows, though, that they will be happy 
                  to spit him out when Russia face their beloved team in the final 
                  of the Davis Cup in the last weekend of November. <br>
                  <br>
                  That is how it goes in sport and Safin is the first to acknowledge 
                  that while this was a wonderful day for him personally, there 
                  will be a good deal more on the line when he crosses swords 
                  with Arnaud Clement and Sebastien Grosjean. <br>
                  <br>
                  The 22-year-old Muscovite was in the kind of mood this week 
                  that makes him such an impossible person to peg. He has filled 
                  the rubbish bins of the most revered courts of the world with 
                  bent rackets, venting his angst against all and sundry, but 
                  here — for reasons that probably escape him — Safin was a model 
                  of calm assurance. Only Nicolas Escude, the conqueror of Tim 
                  Henman, took a set from him in five matches. <br>
                  <br>
                  For someone of Safin’s ability to go so long without a championship 
                  asks inevitable questions about him wasting the gifts with which 
                  God endowed him. From first until this exceptional end, he had 
                  struggled, losing in the final of the Australian Open to Thomas 
                  Johansson, suckered in straight sets in the semi-finals at Roland 
                  Garros by Juan Carlos Ferrero, tied in knots at Wimbledon by 
                  Olivier Rochus, of Belgium, on the first Wednesday, and out 
                  on his feet after a five-set marathon against Nicolas Kiefer 
                  in the first round of the US Open to be easy fodder for Gustavo 
                  Kuerten in the second. <br>
                  <br>
                  Since then, Safin has hardly had a moment to breathe, flying 
                  from Tashkent to Moscow, from Hong Kong to Lyons (via Moscow 
                  again), on to Madrid and finally Paris to collect the points 
                  that would assure him of another long-haul flight, to Shanghai 
                  for the Tennis Masters Cup. His 7-6, 6-0, 6-4 unscrambling of 
                  the best scrambler in the world yesterday not only placed the 
                  icing on his tour cake this year but would have been music to 
                  the ears of Andre Agassi. <br>
                  <br>
                  The complex mathematics of the qualifying process — illustrated 
                  by the fact that Henman missed out on the trip by four points 
                  across a year in which tens of thousands are on offer — means 
                  that Hewitt will succeed in winning the race for the second 
                  successive year if he reaches the final in Shanghai. Should 
                  the Australian stumble along the way, Agassi still has a chance 
                  of overhauling him, but it would need him to hold off challenges 
                  from five of the best eight players in the world this year. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  And Safin is going to be in the field, preparing to wreak his 
                  own havoc on proceedings. It is hard to believe that he can 
                  play like this for two weeks on the trot. “I don’t think this 
                  could be much better,” he said. “If you show Hewitt that you 
                  are broken, the match is finished. Even in the third set, at 
                  5-3 love-40, three match points, he played some great tennis.

                  “Of course, I want to win Shanghai, I want all the money, all 
                  the points, be happy and also win the Davis Cup. I think I can 
                  do it. My tennis is 90 per cent risk, I open the court, go down 
                  the line. If you don’t feel well, you are not confident, you 
                  miss by this much (holding thumb and forefinger a millimetre 
                  apart) and it takes weeks to get that confidence back.” <br>

                  The final yesterday turned on the 15-minute second game of the 
                  second set. Safin had edged the first on a tie-break, having 
                  seen a 4-1 lead whittled away by defiance at its most Hewitt-like, 
                  and broke the Australian’s opening service game in the second. 
                  Safin saw off three break points — one with an extraordinary 
                  reflex forehand played just above the net cord — and raced through 
                  to claim the first love set against the world No 1 in 2? years.

                  Hewitt was never quite fully there. He has been troubled by 
                  debilitating viral conditions for the best part of two years, 
                  which makes you wonder what he might have achieved on his full 
                  physical rations. “I just wanted to come here and try to get 
                  some runs on the board,” he said. “It is a big thrill simply 
                  to get through to the final. I’ve got other things on my mind 
                  at the moment.” <br>

                  It is about holding on through a week in China for which he 
                  will know his round-robin opponents on Wednesday. Safin presents 
                  a threat there, too. “I am enjoying the sport I’ve been playing 
                  since six,” he said. “It is better than cleaning the streets 
                  of Moscow.” <br>
