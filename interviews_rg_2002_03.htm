                    Q. How would you rate your performance today?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: The first two sets was great tennis, I think, 
                    then I lost my game. I had my match in my hands the fourth 
                    set, 3-Love. Just try to make 4-Love. But I just missed everything 
                    and I was a breakdown in the fourth. Was a great fight. I'm 
                    satisfied the way I fought, but not the way I played in the 
                    third and fourth set. <br>
<br>
Q. What happened in the beginning of the third when you had 
                    the break?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Just lost my game, you know. Just I start to 
                    go back. I start to make rallies with him, which is a mistake. 
                    Argentinian players, it's just their game to play on clay, 
                    play long rallies, you know, just stay there, hang in there. 
                    I start to play his game, and that's why I start to have problems, 
                    and that's why I lost my game. My game is just to, you know, 
                    make the point shorter, try to look for the net. That's my 
                    game. After this, is difficult to find your game when you're 
                    already so-so in the first set. Even I had my opportunity 
                    3-Love, and I just -- I didn't play the way I should play.<br>
<br>
Q. Is it a problem of concentration?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No, just like I start to try to play, you know, 
                    for sure. I start to play just not to make many mistakes. 
                    It's not my game. When I start to play from the baseline, 
                    I start to miss anyway. So if I have to look for the net, 
                    I have to put pressure, I have to -- I don't know, look for 
                    the net all the time. That's my game. And I can't play another 
                    game. I'm not good enough, especially if you are playing against 
                    Argentinian guy on clay. Is not a good thing to stand back 
                    and just to make rallies.<br>
<br>
Q. How do you compare your game since the beginning of the 
                    tournament?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Still I make four sets against a guy that he 
                    is a great clay court specialist, I think. To make four sets 
                    is still okay. I mean, I think it's not so bad. But, you know, 
                    could be better. Could finish in three sets. But I was almost 
                    in the fifth set against him, so in the fifth set, you never 
                    know what's going to happen. These kind of matches you have 
                    to finish as soon as possible.<br>
<br>
Q. How is your fitness? It was your hip, I think. <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Difficult. I'm too many kilos and I have to 
                    run on clay. It's difficult. Believe me, it's quite difficult. 
                    But I'm still there, and I have a serve, which is I can save 
                    some points, make a few easy points. Otherwise I'm in big 
                    trouble. <br>
<br>
Q. Now you're in the second week. Do you think it's a new 
                    tournament that begins now? Is it something to be in the second 
                    week?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: You have to go match by match. Now I'm playing 
                    a guy from France. Di Pasquale, he's doing well. He won his 
                    matches quite easy, I think. He's confident. He has support 
                    of the stadium, so it's difficult to play against. But I think 
                    is okay. Second week is already a different game. You have 
                    more confidence. Even the match of today is perfect, just 
                    to have enough confidence to go to second week. It's new tournament 
                    starting. So I think it's good. It's good. I'm feeling comfortable.<br>
<br>
Q. You were good friends with Arnaud a few years ago. Do 
                    you still have relationship with him?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. You know, but the guy had some problems, 
                    injury, so he was out on the tour for one year, I think. He 
                    didn't play so many matches. I didn't see him for a long time. 
                    I know him since 15, 16, so quite good friends. We know each 
                    other quite well. We played a lot of matches when we were 
                    Juniors. So we know each other very good.<br>
<br>
Q. Did you talk with him since the beginning of the tournament 
                    in the locker room or players' lounge?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, yeah. Quite good relationship. <br>
<br>
Q. Back to what you were saying about losing your game, do 
                    you almost expect that when you go on the court? Seems like 
                    you're going great, then without fail, not always a set, but 
                    without fail you can hit a rough spot for a while. Do you 
                    almost expect that?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Can you repeat the question again because I 
                    didn't get any word. Try to make it slow.<br>
<br>
Q. What you were saying before about losing your game, do 
                    you almost expect that when you go on the court, that you're 
                    going to hit a rough patch for a little bit? It seems like 
                    you play well, then without fail there's always a spot where 
                    you sort of get lost, then you come back. Do you almost expect 
                    to lose it?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Of course. I hope I understand your question. 
                    I will try to answer your question. In every match, you have 
                    this feeling that you are losing your game. It means you are 
                    losing a little bit of concentration, you know this. You try 
                    to hang in there. But it's difficult. The other guy is feeling 
                    this, and he's playing much better because he has more confidence 
                    the way the match is going. You have to be careful in this 
                    situation because you know, you can feel it, you're losing 
                    your game, you're losing your concentration. If you miss this 
                    kind of ball, these two kind of balls, probably is the key 
                    of the match because you can get in such trouble that you 
                    not be able to come over. You have to, I don't know, try to, 
                    I don't know, breathe or whatever. Every guy is doing different 
                    things. But it's quite difficult. It's quite difficult. Then 
                    it starts the choking, which is the worst part of the game. 
                    You don't want to get there. You don't want to play these 
                    kind of games. So you try to, I don't know, whatever, just 
                    walk a little bit, try to concentrate as fast as you can. 
                    Because if you lose this moment, you're gone, then you have 
                    a problem.<br>
<br>
Q. It seems like last year you would hit that patch and never 
                    find it. This year we saw it against Rochus even the other 
                    day, you'll find your game again. What are you thinking in 
                    your head to get your game back?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I'm getting older, so I know a little bit the 
                    game (smiling). I know the game a little bit more. But as 
                    soon as you know the game better than before, you start to 
                    choke more. <br>
<br>
Q. You lose either way. <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No. I give you example. When you're 28, 27, 
                    you know the game so well, it's so difficult. When you understand 
                    the game very much, you start to choke. You not understand 
                    it, but the players understand. It's basically that's the 
                    point. So is better to not to understand very well the game, 
                    just play your match the way it comes, you know, just hit 
                    the shots, just give yourself a little bit of space, just 
                    feel free on the court. Because if you start to think what's 
                    going to happen after I lose this court, play cross-court, 
                    miss it down the line, then you have a problem. Just you need 
                    to be a little bit feel free on the court and just play your 
                    game. If you miss it, then you have problem. Then you are 
                    getting into trouble. But you have to risk sometimes. Sometimes 
                    the risk is very important, to be able to risk on some difficult 
                    points. What a speech, huh (laughter).<br>
<br>
Q. Every time after a victory I ask you if you are happy 
                    or not. It's not so obvious even after the match. I would 
                    like to know like you have bad news, like you lost your dog 
                    or something, or is it because you're very focused and concentrated 
                    on the tournament?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Because I'm not happy? <br>
<br>
Q. I always ask you after a victory if you are happy or not 
                    because it's not obvious. I would like to know if you have 
                    bad news, like you lost your dog last week, or just because 
                    you're very focused and serious on the tournament. <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: You cannot be very happy when you're winning, 
                    you cannot be very sad when you're losing. You have to keep 
                    the balance. Is a good answer (smiling)?<br>
<br>
Q. You're in balance?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, I'm trying to -- not to getting too excited. 
                    When you are losing, you can be very sad. I prefer to be okay. 
                    When I'm winning, I'm okay. When I'm losing, it's okay.<br>
<br>
Q. So it's wisdom?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Keep the balance. <br>
               <br>
