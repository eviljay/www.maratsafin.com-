                    MODERATOR: Ladies and Gentlemen, Marat Safin. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You obviously have been trying to work your way in, find 
                    where your confidence level is throughout this tournament. 
                    Is it tough when a guy retires against you? You come out of 
                    the match not knowing exactly where you are. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but I think first set was actually okay. 
                    I played okay. But the second set, he played unbelievable. 
                    Last two games, it was ridiculous. From the volleys, he was 
                    making dropshots, lobs, winners from return. I mean, he's 
                    great player. But he played for like 15 minutes unbelievable 
                    tennis. I couldn't do anything against this. <br>
                    This is why I'm happy that he retired because otherwise it 
                    would be a very big problem to beat him.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. When were you first aware that he was having problems?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I didn't actually realise. I don't know, at the 
                    end I think. He called Doug, the physio.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Second set?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. But he was still playing great tennis. 
                    From the baseline, he was just -- I couldn't do anything against 
                    him. Then he couldn't walk actually. He couldn't run to the 
                    net. He just served, but nothing special. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What did he say to you?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No, what can he say? I'm retiring. I can't play. 
                    Sorry.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Exactly each word he said?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I don't know exactly words.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What are your targets now within this tournament? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Try to play my next match because you cannot 
                    make big plans for this tournament not playing very well actually. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. And the plans for the whole year?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: You never know because my plans for this year 
                    at the beginning of the year was like stay in Top 5. Now it's 
                    my goal to try to be in the Masters, which is 8, 9, try to 
                    be there. I don't know what's going to happen next months. 
                    You can be injured again, just not playing well. Get the confidence 
                    back, play unbelievable tennis here, you can win. I don't 
                    know, some things can change your game completely.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Can you give me an update of the injury situation?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: It was okay, but now I start to have just a little 
                    bit start to bother me again a little bit. But I think with 
                    the time, it will go. I think it's because I played lot of 
                    tournaments. That's why it's very difficult to recover from 
                    the injury completely still playing a hundred percent, still 
                    playing tournaments.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Will you keep on playing a lot of tournaments?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I have to. I mean, I have to. Coming now the 
                    Super 9's, the Masters Series. You have to play. It's things 
                    I have to do, I have to play these tournaments. I can't stop 
                    now and just take a rest, you know, something. I have to keep 
                    playing, take care of my back with physios, with everything, 
                    just try to play.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Yevgeny Kafelnikov was here yesterday and he told us he 
                    spoke to you, maybe expressed his opinion that it would be 
                    better to step back for a while and recover, then return more 
                    stronger. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I don't know, it's his opinion.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You had some words with him about that?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Maybe. I don't remember. But, no, thanks for 
                    his opinion, but I know what I'm doing. Thanks a lot anyway. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Speaking of points, the other day Andrei Medvedev made 
                    the now famous comment that in the former Soviet Union there 
                    was a saying that you won one year, then you celebrated the 
                    next, then came back and won after that. Have you been celebrating 
                    this year? Is there any truth?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I've been celebrating when I have a lot of time 
                    from the injury. What can you celebrate this year? What can 
                    you celebrate this year? What things? That I get injured? 
                    I didn't win one tournament for six months? I just make one 
                    final? <br>
                    You cannot celebrate anything. It's your job. It's a part 
                    of your life. You make money with this. There's no time for 
                    celebration.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Was there any kind of letdown after the US Open breakthrough, 
                    or not really?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No, no. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. An important yet silly question. Why did you cut your hair?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Why I cut my hair? Maybe now I can be more faster 
                    on the court. I don't know. I was try to change something. 
                    Maybe it will change my game.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Has it worked? What do you think?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: You see the people retire, they get scared (smiling). 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What has Mats been telling you about playing on grass?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: He cannot say many words. He can give some advice, 
                    you know, to take care of the serve, very important the first 
                    two points of the game, try to be focused, try to move your 
                    feet a little bit more because the bounces are very bad. Just 
                    this. <br>
                    I mean, you cannot make many comments. Try to play the same 
                    game. You cannot change completely the game for the grass. 
                    You can add some things. Yeah, what I'm trying to do, go to 
                    the volley. You cannot go for the volley each time because 
                    is not my game. Nothing else. Just play the game the way I'm 
                    playing on hard court or clay, the same. Just to try to think 
                    a little bit more, try to play a little bit more focused because 
                    one, two points can decide the match actually.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Is your serve as good as it was at the US Open?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I'm trying to get there, but no, I don't think 
                    it's working a hundred percent. Yeah, it's getting better 
                    compared to weeks before. It will be okay for the second week.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You are a veteran in a short time of the great highs and 
                    the great lows of playing professional tennis. You win a US 
                    Open, then the injury. Andy Roddick is getting this hype around 
                    him. As someone who has been through it, do you have any advice 
                    to give somebody?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I don't give advice. I mean, it's his life, he 
                    has a coach. I am nobody to give advice to anybody. I think 
                    he's great player, that's for sure. It's not secret. I think 
                    everybody knows that he going to stay in Top 10 for a long 
                    time. I mean, is not a new thing. He just has a coach. He 
                    doesn't need anything else. I think the coach, he knows what 
                    to do. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You have a lot of points to defend in the next couple of 
                    months. Does that add a lot of pressure? Does it discourage 
                    you that you have an injury?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I don't care how many points I have to defend 
                    because it depends a lot the way how you play. I mean, if 
                    you play okay, doesn't matter if you have to defend final 
                    of US Open, quarterfinals in all these tournaments. Doesn't 
                    matter. If you play well, anyway you can make quarters, semis. 
                    Is not a problem for me. <br>
                    If I lose the first round, it will not change my life. If 
                    I drop to 20, doesn't matter. I have a coach. I know what 
                    I want. I know my best tennis. So next year. Nothing going
