                    <br>
                    MODERATOR: Questions for Marat. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Could you give us an update on your physical condition 
                    and how fit you feel going in.<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I'm doing better, but I have some -- sometimes 
                    I have pain in my back. I don't know, when I'm getting (tired/tight?), 
                    It's getting tight the muscle, it gives me some problem. <br>
                    But I can serve. I'm okay. It's just a matter of time. Just 
                    make myself a little bit stronger than it is right now. Just 
                    play some matches.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Can you also comment on this surface in terms of how suitable 
                    you feel it is to your game and whether or not there is still 
                    a clay court style like there used to be where some guys would 
                    do well on clay, not anywhere else. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but the reason is, I mean, play on clay 
                    court just for two months maybe, and then the rest of the 
                    year we're playing on hard court. Anyway, if you want, you 
                    have -- at least I have a hard court style. It's like playing 
                    on the line, try to play on the line. <br>
                    Clay court is a little bit different game. You have to go 
                    out, go inside. It's a little bit different game, different 
                    style of game. <br>
                    But it's just the matter of how confident are you. You can 
                    play on clay like you play on hard court, like add some few 
                    things. That's it. Most important is the tactic against the 
                    guys, against guys who you are playing with. <br>
                    Just play game, just try to get the confidence back. Doesn't 
                    matter. If you confident, doesn't matter where you play, clay 
                    court, hard court, indoors, whatevers.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Watching your results this year, for somebody who watches 
                    the game once in a while, they might be very surprised to 
                    see you haven't had many victories lately. Is it really purely 
                    physical from your point of view or is it also fatigue?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I mean, I had the very long last year. I have 
                    been playing so many tournaments in the second part of the 
                    year, and I had no time to prepare for this season at all. 
                    I mean, ten days is not enough to prepare yourself for the 
                    new season. That's why I didn't make any good results in Australia, 
                    nothing. I was very tired, I was dead. After one set, I couldn't 
                    play anymore. <br>
                    Especially the reason, I get injured. I think it's the same 
                    thing. You're not prepared, the muscles are getting (tired/tight?), 
                    You just pull the muscle. That's the reason. <br>
                    The problem is also you get injured. I got injured right before 
                    The Masters Series in Indian Wells and Miami, so I missed 
                    two. I couldn't play Monte-Carlo because of the same reason. 
                    Three Masters Series. <br>
                    I was playing actually very good in Dubai, I start to play 
                    very good. <br>
                    If I'm not getting injured, it's completely different story. 
                    I'm not telling that I could make some good results in Indian 
                    Wells, but I think it's different way, a very different way. 
                    Playing great, confidence, you are not injured, you go to 
                    a tournaments with different mentality. <br>
                    You get injured, you cannot play. You can't play. I couldn't 
                    serve, I couldn't do anything. I lost three major tournaments. 
                    That's why I'm starting again very late. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What is your mentality now?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Try to play some matches. I don't have many matches 
                    yet.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How are you going to prepare for Wimbledon this year?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: The same. I play two tournaments before. Just 
                    play as much as I can on grass. That's the thing that makes 
                    the difference, playing good, playing bad. Play two tournaments 
                    before, make quarters, semifinals. I try to play two tournaments 
                    before Wimbledon so I get used to play on grass.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You look at the results of Guga and Juan Carlos have had 
                    so far on clay this year. It's been pretty impressive. Do 
                    you think if you were able to get yourself in good physical 
                    shape, you'd be able to beat them here?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I don't care what results they have. I don't 
                    care. I mean, it doesn't bother me at all. I'm coming here, 
                    I'm playing my game. I don't care. I don't see who's winning, 
                    who's playing, who's losing. I'm just trying to get my confidence 
                    back, play some matches. If I can win, I can win. That's for 
                    sure. <br>
                    I'm coming here to win, I'm not coming here to make last 16 
                    or quarterfinals. For me, it's nothing. I want to win here. 
                    First of all if I will win, and it also depends of the draw, 
                    who I'm playing, how I'm playing. If I can get confidence 
                    in next round, it would be great. It's completely different 
                    game. <br>
                    For the moment, I'm on the way to playing better. It doesn't 
                    bother me Kuerten or Ferrero. I can play against them. I beat 
                    them already. The guys are playing well, yeah. Too far. Way 
                    too far. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Can you talk about how important it is finishing or reaching 
                    No. 1 compared to winning Grand Slams for you at this point 
                    in your career?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I think it's a little bit different. You can't 
                    compare winning Grand Slam to be No. 1. I mean, if you are 
                    No. 1, you win US Open. If you don't win Grand Slam, actually 
                    doesn't make sense, I think. You have to win at least one 
                    Grand Slam title to be No. 1. Also winning a Grand Slam title 
                    and not being No. 1 is also not good. Together it's perfect, 
                    you know (smiling).<br>
                    I was lucky to be at the time No. 1. I had a great time. I 
                    want to be there again, try to get there again. Obviously, 
                    it's going to be a little bit difficult for some reasons. 
                    I'll try to make it next year, if it's possible. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. The way the game is today, can you imagine anybody staying 
                    No. 1 as long as Pete Sampras did in the 1990s?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No way. Pete, he's the best. He will be the best 
                    for the rest of the future of tennis. I think nobody can win 
                    13 Grand Slam titles. It's no chance. Everybody's playing 
                    quite similar. There's not one guy, you can't play against 
                    him. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How important for you is your mental preparation?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Important? <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Yes. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: It's very important. That's why I have Mats Wilander, 
                    so he can prepare me practically, mentally, technically, everything. 
                    That's why I took him. That's why he wants to work with me. 
                    He want to help me. <br>
                    For the moment, it's very important.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Do you have somebody, a kind of guru they call? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You know what I mean?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I know what you mean.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Someone who makes you stronger. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No. Mats is enough. He's enough. More than enough. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How did winning the US Open change your life? Was there 
                    anything at all negative about it? Was it just a fantastic 
                    change for you?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: It's great. You win US Open, is great. But still, 
                    it's already past. Now we are in 2001. Now everybody wants 
                    to win the tournament, 2001 US Open. They will remember probably 
                    me. &quot;Yeah, the guy, he won US Open 2000.&quot; But you 
                    have to win one more time, another time, try to win it each 
                    year.<br>
                    It was a great time. I enjoyed it very much. Thanks a lot.

                    Q. But it wasn't like a situation where that became sort of 
                    overwhelming and became a lot of pressure for you?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No. I think the people, they respect you more. 
                    I think that's the thing. If you win a Grand Slam title, you 
                    have a name in history. I think it's make difference to win 
                    a Grand Slam title.<br>
