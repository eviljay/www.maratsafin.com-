<td class="article-body"><P><STRONG>Safin tries to hold serve with emotions, career</STRONG> <BR>By Jill Lieber, USA TODAY<BR><BR>Marat Safin had his defining moment when he was 20. He blasted Pete Sampras in straight sets in the 2000 U.S. Open final, playing what Sampras said was "the tennis of the future."<BR>Marat Safin is maturing and looking to build on his 2005 Australian Open win, his first Grand Slam in more than four years.&nbsp; <BR></P>
<P><IMG src="/Admin/spaw/DatabaseImages/2005-04-27-safin-inside.jpg">By Bernat Armangue, AP </P>
<P>He won his first Grand Slam, reached No. 1 in the world and watched his bank account, international profile, social life and material wealth multiply overnight.<BR>Yet, he asked himself, again and again, is that all there is?<BR>"There was nothing else to achieve," he says. "Still, there was an emptiness in my heart. I had everything, but I had nothing."<BR>Today, at 25 and ranked No. 4, Safin still is struggling to find meaning in his life. <BR>On Jan. 30, after a 4 1/2-year odyssey, he won his second Grand Slam, the 2005 Australian Open. He defeated No. 1 Roger <BR>Federer of Switzerland in an epic, five-set semifinal, fighting off a match point and ending Federer's 26-match winning streak. <BR>Then he snuffed out Lleyton Hewitt of Australia in the final, thanks in large part to the calming influence of Federer's former coach, Peter Lundgren, now Safin's coach.<BR>But, true to form, it took Safin about three months to win more than two matches in a row in a tournament after that.<BR>Now his friends and family, his coach and the tennis world are waiting to see which Safin will show up at the French Open, a tournament he certainly has the game and desire to win, beginning May 23 at Roland Garros in Paris.<BR>"The criticism is he's inconsistent and has never taken his talent seriously," says Hall of Famer Jim Courier, winner of four Grand Slam titles. "The truth is he's a terrific athlete who can match up with Roger Federer when they're both having their best day on court. That list starts and stops with Marat. But has he put it all together? We're all still waiting to see that happen."<BR>Adds U.S. Davis Cup coach Patrick McEnroe: "Physically, he's so talented. He is intimidating, just by his physique. He's 6-foot-4, with a monster serve and monster return, which makes it tougher. He's been miserable since Australia. With him, it's always a question of how long he can keep his head together."<BR>Federer isn't shaking in his sneakers.<BR>"The last few months, the beginning of this year, it was looking good for him," Federer says. "But he still needs more than that, I think. ... If he can play all the way through an entire year, then I think that's when we're really going to say, 'Gee, Marat has changed.' "<BR><BR><U>A great show for the fans </U></P>
<P>Safin is one of the most complicated and compelling athletes in sports.</P>
<P>He's a passionate, unpredictable perfectionist with a brooding soul.<BR>He's honest to a fault.&nbsp;<BR>He breaks rackets when he gets disgusted with himself&nbsp;- more than 300, he estimates, at last count.<BR>He berates himself in Russian, Spanish or English when he makes stupid mistakes.<BR>He pretends to cry when he hits balls into the net.<BR>He even dropped his pants to celebrate a spectacular point at last year's French Open.</P>
<P>Courier, arguably the most introspective player of his era, is, not surprisingly, an unabashed Safin fan.<BR>"Marat's one of the most entertaining characters in tennis in the past 20 years," Courier says. "People miss my generation of players. They felt something with us; they knew something about us. Marat's something to behold. Hopefully, people will feel him, and know him, more."<BR></P></td>
