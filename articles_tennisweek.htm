                  tiebreak is tennis' tug of war and tensions tightened four times 
                  today before Marat Safin pulled through with a 7-6 (7-5), 6-7 
                  (2-7), 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-5) triumph over Ivan Ljubicic in an 
                  exhausting second round encounter that spanned three hours and 
                  27 minutes today. <br>
                  <br>
                  It was the ninth straight U.S. Open victory for the defending 
                  U.S. Open champion who fought a familiar foe and faced his own 
                  fears in emerging with the first U.S. Open victory in four tiebreaks 
                  since Derrick Rostagno defeated Jakob Hlasek 6-7, 7-6, 7-6, 
                  7-6 in the third round of the 1991 U.S. Open. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I've known him for seven years. We first played when I 
                  was 14 and he's a very tough guy to play,&quot; Safin said. 
                  &quot;It was very tough. But I was luck on tiebreaks. I was 
                  really scared.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  Fear fueled Safin's aggressive play in the final set tiebreak. 
                  With the score deadlocked 4-4, Safin slammed a 134 mph ace down 
                  the middle and followed by stepping up to the service line and 
                  firing a flat forehand winner crosscourt that landed inside 
                  the sideline to reach match point at 6-4. Two points later, 
                  Safin sealed the match with his 16th ace down the middle then 
                  celebrated by bashing a ball into the stands. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;To keep staying on the baseline and wait for his mistakes 
                  is a little bit stupid,&quot; said Safin of his decision to 
                  attack in the final tiebreak. &quot;I decided to do something 
                  and put him under pressure because the guy was struggling a 
                  little bit with the forehand. I tried to go to the net. I think 
                  it's a good thing to have one match like this, very difficult. 
                  You have to fight.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  A year ago, Safin fought through a similar match in the third 
                  round against Sebastien Grosjean. Two points from defeat in 
                  the fifth set tiebreak, Safin rallied after a rain delay and 
                  stormed back to earn a 6-4, 7-6 (7-3), 1-6, 3-6, 7-6 (7-5) victory. 
                  That match inspired Safin, who dropped only one set the rest 
                  of the tournament. Safin is quick to dismiss comparisons to 
                  his breakthrough at the 2000 U.S. Open and insists he is not 
                  nearly as confident as he was then. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I can't compare myself with last year,&quot; he said. 
                  &quot;Last year I played and everything was perfect. I was playing 
                  unbelievable. I feel comfortable on the court and it was a great 
                  feeling to play. But now, I'm struggling. It's very difficult 
                  to play. It's very difficult to fight because you don't have 
                  enough confidence.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  While his confidence may be waning, Safin's concentration deserted 
                  him in the second set as he let a 4-2, 40-15 lead dissipate 
                  and watched Ljubicic come back to win the set and even the match.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I lost my opportunity, it was like a joke,&quot; Safin 
                  said. &quot;I just completely lost my concentration. I just 
                  went out of the match. I mean, I was completely lost. It was 
                  very difficult to come back, really.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  Earlier in his career, Safin may have responded to the frustrating 
                  mental lapse by smashing his racquet, but instead the man who 
                  once led the ATP in broken racquets rallied by rushing the net 
                  and knocking off a forehand volley winner to take a 6-4 lead 
                  in the third set tiebreak. When Ljubicic lofted a backhand that 
                  landed long by four inches Safin seized the third set. In a 
                  match that featured only two service breaks, one from each player, 
                  Safin's superior play on the big points proved to be pivotal. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;The whole match was so equal,&quot; said Ljubicic, who 
                  surrendered the first set when he double faulted on set point. 
                  &quot;It could go either way. I don't think there is any difference 
                  actually. He served unbelievable.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  The third-seeded Safin meets Moroccan Hicham Arazi in the third 
                  round. Safin said his conquest of Pete Sampras in last year's 
                  final was a once in a lifetime effort he doesn't expect to duplicate, 
                  but he's still striving to regain the rhythm he had last year. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;It was too perfect,&quot; Safin said. &quot;It can happen 
                  once in my life, last year. If you come back and try to win 
                  again it's an unbelievable, beautiful feeling because you have 
                  an unbelievable reason to have a huge party with your friends. 
                  That's why I'm coming here. I want to win again because it's 
                  a nice feeling.&quot;<br>
