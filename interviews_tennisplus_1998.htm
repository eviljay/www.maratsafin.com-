                    1998 - From the Russian Magazine "Tennis+" <br>
                    An interview with Marat and his parents shortly after he came 
                    back<br>
                    from the French Open in 1998. <br>
                    </b></font></p>
                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b><br>
                    Question </b>- In the last couple of days you've given lots 
                    of interviews. The interest of the journalists is absolutely 
                    understandable. But you probably know by now that communication 
                    with press has became a part of your job?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat -</b> Yes, I was already told this by people from 
                    IFT.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question </b>- These meetings and conversations are in 
                    your interest also. When you talk about the match, contestants, 
                    about yourself then there is less chance that somebody will 
                    be false about how the things really are.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat's Father</b> - Unfortunately it has already taken 
                    place when they wrote something he didn't tell in the interview. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat</b> - I don't really care. Let them write whatever 
                    they want. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - That's a risky out-giving...Marat, do you 
                    realise that journalists misrepresent facts not because they 
                    want to offend you or Kafelnikov. Sometimes a reporter catches 
                    his ear at something without having a chance to verify the 
                    information because the player is not very accessable. That 
                    is where improvisations take place. But lets get down to business...You 
                    have already given tens of interviews, what haven't you been 
                    asked about yet? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat</b> - I guess I told everything I ever could about 
                    my tennis life. You know, there came Inna Raskazova from "Moskovski 
                    Komsomolets" and we had a very detailed conversation. And 
                    then she suddenly said: there has already been so much positive 
                    said about you, maybe there also is something negative? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - What is that your coach in Spain Rafael 
                    Mensua gave you that your mother couldn't give? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat</b> - Ask any player and he will tell you how difficult 
                    it is with your parents. There comes a moment when you simply 
                    start sending them to hell in your mind. And if it's a strange 
                    person who is working with you, things change. You respect 
                    him as a specialist, in the end you pay him money... A success 
                    or a failure depend on what relationships you have with your 
                    coach. I am friends with mine.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - They say about you that you are a formed 
                    player of the Spanish school. Do you agree with this formula?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat</b> - Well, if they say so... But actually, tell 
                    me what innovations in the technique of these or that shots 
                    did I get in Spain in comparison to what my mother gave me 
                    in Moscow?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat's Mother </b>- To call him the forsterling of the 
                    Spanish school is the same as to consider Kournikova being 
                    the forsterling of the American school. She used to spend 
                    the entire summer with us on "Spartak's" courts . Her trips 
                    to America can be called practise. But you can be practising 
                    now here, tomorrow there, then some place else but the school 
                    stays Russian.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat </b>- By the way, and what is the core of the Spanish 
                    school? We have to decide on what Spanish school is. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - In the translation of your match with Courier 
                    in the Davis Cup after a couple of obvious mistakes when playing 
                    volleys they said: well, what did you expect Spaniards are 
                    not too good playing at the net.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat's Father</b> - What journalists are saying is just 
                    nonsence: "He can't play at the net" What makes them think 
                    this way? If Marat is playing really well at the base line, 
                    if he doesn't come to the net too often, it is not the basis 
                    for such statements. Marat's present game was given to him 
                    by his mother - the coach. Rosa liked playing at the net herself. 
                    Remember how Marat did at "Roland Garros". Typical episode. 
                    I was listening to Alik Mitrivelli's comments: "It would've 
                    been great if he approached to the net right now." And Marat 
                    as if he could hear him came to the net and successfully won 
                    the point...It's just that he is lacking game experience yet. 
                    Practice. Not the one that you can get while training but 
                    just game practice. By the way, something of that sort happened 
                    to Andrei Medvedev, but he just let this moment slip away.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat</b> - And all this has nothing to do with the Spanish 
                    school. Moya plays really well at the front, comes to the 
                    net very often. It shows especially if you are not playing 
                    doubles...Alex Corretja plays. Even Alberto Berasategui does. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - What about you, are you going to play doubles?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat </b>- I can't get anywhere yet, my ranking is too 
                    low. But I would like to, with great pleasure. Right now I 
                    will try to solve this problem somehow.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - Do you have any distinct options?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat</b> - I've got a contract with IMG. I asked people 
                    from the agency to help me get a wild card for doubles. I 
                    want to play. It's interesting, plus the money. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - Well, it's not only the money. Kafelnikov 
                    explained that he improved his game in singles after he got 
                    the feel of the doubles. And money goes next. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat </b>- How can I understand this? Money don't go next. 
                    Money is always money...Why play doubles? To earn money in 
                    the first place. There is nothing to be ashamed of here. Then 
                    doubles is the same practice only that you are paid for it. 
                    Profitable and pleasant together.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - Mixed? Marat - That's not serious.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question </b>- OK, but lets get back to the question of 
                    the "Spanish school". <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat </b>- Spanish school? Well you will write everything 
                    as it is. And what's the good of it? Probably none of the 
                    journalists will even read it. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - I'm bound to think that they will. We have 
                    noticed and not even once that those who write about tennis 
                    borrow materials from "Tennis +". In the end we are the only 
                    specialised edition.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat </b>- I think I have Russian school, and I don't 
                    really understand why journalists write about my Spanish school. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - Tell now, can it be asserted that the favourite 
                    surface is clay?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat</b> - I've been playing on clay for 4 years. But 
                    I'm doing pretty well on hard too. A couple of weeks of training 
                    and everything will come. I don't have like, say Berasategui, 
                    such an extreme addiction to clay. For him it really takes 
                    a lot of guts to play on hard. But he does play and even not 
                    too bad at times. Where did he beat Krajicek? I guess in Paris, 
                    in Autumn, on the carpet. And Ferreira - he beat him on hard 
                    in America. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - Are hard courts widespread in Spain or they 
                    only have clay courts? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat</b> - There is one satellite on hard. The rest are 
                    clay courts and tournaments. Question - Have you played challengers 
                    on clay?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat </b>- In summer I tried to play in Portugal on hard. 
                    Then October through December I played all the tournaments 
                    on hard only. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - Now everybody quotes Ivan Lendl:"Grass is 
                    for cows". What do you think?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat </b>- I never even tried to play on grass. Maybe 
                    I'll like it. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - Let's pass on to something else...Your mother 
                    said that you were going to take the exam for drivers licence. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat </b>- I've already taken it. Here, take a look. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - What car do you have? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat</b> - Used "Golf", something like "Felicia". I almost 
                    got it for free. It hasn't been a long time since I learned 
                    to drive, I don't really want to smash a new car. I'll change 
                    it later for "Mercedes". They promised to give it to me already 
                    this year.<br>

                    to be working at now? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat</b> - The main thing is game at the net. The rest

                    <b>Marat </b>- I don't like American Twists. That's why it

                    <br>
                    <b>Marat</b> - Mother taught me the technique. And then the 
                    main things are your motions, catching the rhythm. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - When our team was playing Davis Cup finals 
                    with Sweden and then with America were you in Moscow or in

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    invite you to the Davis Cup team? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat </b>- I was in Austria then. Mother said that Shamil 
                    Anviarovich Tarpischev called and invited me to play for the 
                    team. I first came to the Davis Cup when we were playing with 
                    Romania. Our team won. And then Shamil Anviarovich told me 
                    about America. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - Did he tell you that you were going to be 
                    number 2? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat</b> - No. Then everybody were in the team: Volkov, 
                    Cherkasov, Olhovski. But it happened so that I was the one 
                    who played.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - Does TV in Spain, in the apartment that 
                    you rent, get the channels from Russia? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat</b> - No.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - So you detached now from life in Russia? 
                    You learn about what is going on here from what your parents 
                    tell you?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat</b> - Yes, in general. You can also learn something 
                    from local TV news. <br>
                    <b><br>
                    Question </b>- Do you speak English?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat</b> - Not too well really. I normally speak with 
                    Spaniards and our guys. Well, I can speak English. I don't 
                    know if I say properly what I want to express, but here the 
                    important thing is to be understood.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> -...and you haven't had any misunderstandings? 
                    You have already said quite a lot of interesting things in 
                    Russian. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat </b>- What do you mean?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - The interview in "Moskovski Komsomolets"<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat</b> - That's what you mean...the journalist asks 
                    me: "Do you drink?" Our conversation took place during the 
                    tournament, plus it was the tournament where I was playing 
                    for the first time. Was that serious to ask me that? So I 
                    answered, in a joke: - I do. - Do you smoke? - I don't. - 
                    Did you go some place here? - I did. - What did you drink? 
                    - Whisky... That was the funny conversation we had. And then 
                    I found out from the newspaper that I liquor up every day. 
                    What I just can't understand is how did I manage to have enough 
                    strength for seven matches, three of which, with Kuerten, 
                    Agassi and Pioline, were five sets matches... <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - Lets move on. Do you have a girlfriend? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat</b> - Her name is Silvia. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - Does she also play tennis?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat</b> - She used to. She had a trauma of her leg. Her 
                    sister still keeps on playing. We are in the same club with 
                    her. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Question</b> - You live not far from each other?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Marat</b> - 10 minutes. Valencia is not a big city. <br>
