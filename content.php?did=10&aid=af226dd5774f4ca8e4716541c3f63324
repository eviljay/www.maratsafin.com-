<P><FONT size=2>The Man Who Loved Tennis<BR>Peter Bodo<BR>Posted 3/16/2006 @ 8:14 PM</FONT></P>
<P><FONT size=2><EM>Peter Bodo is a well known writer<BR>in the tennis world and writes a blog<BR>on Tennis.com. To read the full <BR>article <BR></EM><BR>After Marat Safin lost to Jarkko Nieminen the other day, he came to the interview room and very rationally and analytically de-constructed the way his mind – and game – were blown by a bad call he got while leading 4-2 in the first set of their encounter.<BR><BR>One bad call and the next thing you know, Nieminen has his arms high in the air, and he might just as well be proclaiming, “I am Jarkko, master of all I survey!”<BR><BR>Safin performed the autopsy looking very much like a cross between a dissipated rock star and a prophet, his voice deep and resonant, a smile on his face, his glittering eyes framed to the chin on either side by limp hanks of wet, curly hair.<BR><BR>Of course, fans of the games most lovable – and intelligent – knucklehead will recognize this as classic Safin: Find some incredibly dumb way to lose a match to a guy – Jarkko Nieminen! – you ought to crush, and do it after taking out Carlos Moya and the redoubtable Nikolay Davydenko in succession in your previous two matches.<BR><BR>Marat. We love you, big guy, But what on earth are we going to do with you?<BR><BR>Well, I couldn’t resist asking Safin why, if he could be so honest and level-headed in the presser about what happened out there, why couldn’t he sort of take the same approach when the incident that tripped him out for the entire match actually occurred?<BR><BR>He replied:<BR><BR><BR><EM>“Well, I'm getting old (smiling). No, you get mature. I mean, experience-wise. You see. You see yourself a little bit from outside of the court. You know what's going on in your head. You really understand what is going on, and you actually cannot do anything about it. The only thing you can do is to laugh inside of yourself, just take it as easy as possible. Because it's already enough that I lost to the guy that I win last five times. Just the situation that you find yourself in the court, it's already in a hole. <BR><BR>So at least give yourself a credit and say to yourself that you've been out for seven months, you beat a good players. There is one bad day at the office. Don't be too hard on yourself. It's another five years of career, at least these kind of losses will happen. Of course, it really hurts, this kind of things. That second set, you just -- you don't know what you're doing.<BR><BR>But also it's a little bit understandable also for me being out for so long. You don't really know when to come in, when to stay. You always choose the wrong -- you make the wrong decision. So there's nothing wrong with that.”<BR></EM><BR><BR>Clearly, a little got lost in translation there; to a follow up question on the subject, he answered that it was a big point – a break point that wiped out his break advantage and ultimately cost him the set. In that sense, it was more than just a bad call. <BR><BR>Okay, got it. But still, top players don’t lose matches because of one bad call early in a match; it isn’t exactly how you become – or stay – a top player. But Safin is different. The player he’s most like, emotionally, is Ilie Nastase, that awesome talent and lifelong, unreconstructed flake. There is one crucial difference, though. Safin never makes things ugly, or infuriates his fellow players with gamesmanship the way Nasty did so often.<BR><BR>My take: If Safin weren’t so complex an individual, he’d have half-a-dozen Slam and be up to his ears in a rivalry with Roger Federer. This may get a few fans of The Mighty Fed steamed, but I wouldn’t want to hazard a guess on who would lead that rivalry, either. For if Federer has more tools, Safin has a bigger game. Federer may have a smidgen more all-around talent, but Safin has a genius for the minimal (his U.S. Open final win over Pete Sampras was the ultimate combination of simplicity and beauty). And they both are creative, instinctive shotmakers.<BR><BR>All in all, though, it was a great week for Safin, and you could read it all over his broad, tanned face. For those of you who aren’t exactly sure of what’s been going on with him, here’s the short version: He’s just coming back from a seven-month forced absence due to a knee injury. <BR><BR>Safin tore ligaments under his left kneecap early in the middle of last year and, after consulting various doctors, declined to undergo surgery (ironically, this would have shortened his down time). Instead, he bit the bullet and took the six-month-plus break to treat his injury with rest, therapy, and other non-invasive procedures. These presumably were sophisticated treatments, because Safin himself dismissed cortisone as “so past century,” although he conceded it might be okay for journalists.<BR><BR>Here's Safin's rationale:<BR><BR><BR><EM>”If you get operated and something can go wrong and you can just say bye-bye to tennis, because it’s never sure what’s going on in the surgery. . .Of course there is a lot of geniuses who that think they know better than the others, they say just to open me, let me have the surgery. But another 50 say don’t do it because something might go wrong and you are done.”<BR></EM><BR><BR>So Safin took the long route back, and it's great to have him among us again. Here's another thing about this guy: At a time when the committment and professionalism of so many top players is questionable, he's got a refreshing love for the game.<BR><BR>Safin is a celebrity who transcends the sport in many of its capitals, a chick magnet extraordinaire, and a thoughtful guy who has never been mistaken for a racquet-toting robot. But listen to what he said when I asked him if it was difficult for a freewheeling guy like himself to observe the discipline required by therapy and rehab:<BR><BR><BR><EM>”Everything what is surrounding tennis, being on the tour, it's already a good thing. It doesn't matter if you -- take you two hours before you going on the court because otherwise what are the options? I've been out for seven months and I was begging to come back, the doctors, to hurry up the process.<BR><BR>For four months, I was wishing to come back, even do the stretching, do everything that is possible just to be on the court, go out on the court and see the spectators watching the game, to be able to run and play the full power.<BR><BR></EM><BR>Someone threw in, (Even when you) Get a bad call?<BR><BR><BR><EM>“Doesn't matter. At least I'm sitting here right now, which already make me happy. Really appreciate actually everybody who helped me to come back because I cannot explain. This is your life. I've been doing this for 20 years. All of a sudden you get injured and you never come back. This is completely changing your life and changing your way of thinking.”<BR></EM><BR><BR>Welcome back, Marat. I hope you win a major soon.<BR></P><!-- google_ad_section_end --></FONT></TD></TR>
