                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On Tuesday, Russian No. 2 seed Marat Safin was defeated in 
                    his opening round against Sweden's Thomas Johansson.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    MODERATOR: Questions for Marat.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Is the back as troublesome as it was in Dubai? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No, it's getting much better. At least I could 
                    serve a little bit better than Dubai. But, of course, it wasn't 
                    enough. Also I think I didn't practice for one week. I tried, 
                    you know, to stay relax and try to take care of my back, so 
                    that was the reason. I make some easy mistakes because not 
                    playing for one week. Of course, I was all the time under 
                    pressure. It's difficult to play against these kind of guys 
                    like Johansson who has a big serve, and he makes very easy 
                    point. You have to be very careful with the serve. But at 
                    least I make a good match, 7-5, 7-5. I'm a little bit disappointed 
                    that the injury is this week, which is Masters Series, is 
                    very important for me. But still I'm happy that even playing 
                    this way I make not bad result. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. I saw you the other day hitting the ball with the big belt. 
                    You can't play that, obviously? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, of course. You can play. I can play from 
                    the baseline. I can play from the volley. The problem is that 
                    I'm scared a little bit to get injured again. Still I have 
                    a little bit pain inside, but it's more you get scared. Some 
                    bad movements on the serve, again one week and a half, two 
                    weeks, maybe more. I have to be careful. I think is even better 
                    to lose here in the first round, to prepare myself to Miami 
                    and be a hundred percent. Otherwise it could be worser, you 
                    know. If I would win, play the next day, play more and more. 
                    Then it's getting tighter or getting worse. But I'm happy 
                    for one part, but another part a little bit disappointed.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Do you think the time off between now and Miami is going 
                    to be enough? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Of course. I have almost how many days? I'm seeded, 
                    I think, still seeded (smiling). I start on Saturday. Today 
                    is Tuesday. I have enough time.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. When you hurt it, did you hurt it serving? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. When you were playing today, is that the only part that 
                    hurt? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, because you have to be careful. All the 
                    time you're afraid to make a movements on the serve. You cannot 
                    serve hard. You don't make normal movements when you serve. 
                    So when the serve go, it's like 90 miles per hour. It is not 
                    enough, of course, to play.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Have physicians advised you that you can't aggravate your 
                    condition by continuing to play? Have they told you that your 
                    shoulder can't get worse, or your back can't get worse, if 
                    you continue to play? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: If it can get worse? <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What did the doctor say? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: The doctor said I have to be careful what I'm 
                    doing. I can play, but the problem is if it happens again 
                    and I break the muscle, then I have to go to the hospital 
                    for three months. I don't want to do it, so I prefer to lose 
                    - not to lose. I mean, I try today. It's better to lose first 
                    round in Indian Wells without any points than to lose two 
                    months, three months, lose all the other events like Monte-Carlo, 
                    Hamburg, Rome, Roland Garros. I think is better to lose here.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Why not default, withdraw? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: You have to try. Why not? I tried. I mean, I 
                    didn't lose 6-Love, 6-Love. I tried. I had even opportunities. 
                    I was break up in the first set, 4-All in the second set, 
                    15-40. I mean, the guy, he played very well at these moments. 
                    <br>
                    Even like this, I had chances. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How pleased are you to have Mats Wilander by your side, 
                    how did that come about? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Actually, I'm very happy that Mats, he came here. 
                    He played the tournament in Naples, in Florida. He came here 
                    especially, you know, to start with me. I'm trying to be nice 
                    to him (laughter). You know, we would like to try. If it works, 
                    it works. If it doesn't work, it doesn't work. But we need 
                    time to get know each other, these kind of things. For the 
                    moment, is going not bad. Even I lose, but he was happy with 
                    me.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How are you trying to be nice with him? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: What? I pay the bills, I pay everything.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. It was once said that Wilander's greatest strength was 
                    his brain. Do you get the sense that he's a really smart guy? 
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I think it can help me a lot, the brain of Mats. 
                    But I think we have a different characters, you know. I need 
                    what he has, and actually he needs what I have. But he's a 
                    coach, so I'm trying to - he will teach me, for sure, be a 
                    little bit more calm on the court, be nice with the people, 
                    I don't know, stay calm, think a little bit what are you doing 
                    on the court, which moment of the match you have to go to 
                    the net, stay back, do whatever. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Is he someone that you thought of or that somebody else 
                    suggested, &quot;Why don't you ask him?&quot; <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Actually, he has a friend and we meet in St. 
                    Polten, Austria, December. He was sitting on a bar, drinking 
                    a beer. Listen, I don't know if I'm allowed to say this, because 
                    Mats - I tell you. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. We don't think he'll mind. We won't tell him. <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Okay, okay. Sitting in a bar talking. He says, 
                    &quot;Mats, he's interested in just teaching you, coach you.&quot; 
                    &quot;Yes, yes, is okay.&quot; But the next day I start to 
                    think, it's not bad idea. I have no coach. I have nobody. 
                    I try alone. I need to spend the money on somebody. So I think 
                    it was a good idea. Also Sasha said, &quot;You have to go 
                    with Mats, don't be stupid. Make him come to the tournaments. 
                    Pay whatever it is.&quot; You cannot find these kind of guys 
                    every day. I think it's a big opportunity for me to learn 
                    something big. Of course, thanks a lot to Sasha, to Andrei, 
                    to help me a lot. But now Sasha, he told me that I have to 
                    make this choice and take Wilander. I think he was right. 
                    I'm happy.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You got angry a lot today. Was that because you were frustrated 
                    with your back, that you couldn't play as well as you can 
                    play, or was it just line calls? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Some of them is like frustration. But some of 
                    them I think, I don't know, but I feel sometimes today the 
                    chair umpire, he makes three mistakes. For me, it's important. 
                    For the first time in two weeks I make an ace, less than a 
                    hundred miles per hour. The guy doesn't see this ball? The 
                    question, &quot;What are you doing sitting there?&quot; I 
                    was pissed with him. He know why. I think it's normal. Everybody 
                    is trying to do all our best there. It's our business. It's 
                    our job. Be a man. When I'm talking to him, I didn't felt 
                    that he was there on the court. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Was that baseline call in the last game another one you 
                    didn't like?<br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: The last game? <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Yes. <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I serve? <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. No. One on your baseline, when you threw your racquet down. 
                    Looked to us as if it was right on the line. It was called 
                    out. Don't remember it? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Doesn't matter. Now doesn't matter.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What crossed your mind when your opponent in the match 
                    got the ball around the post? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: That it is not my day. I mean, it's not every 
                    day happens to me these things. The guy, I have the opportunity 
                    4-All, 15-40, to break him. Yeah, I make only one mistake. 
                    Then he played unbelievable shots. What you can do? You can't 
                    do anything. I try it. He was much better than me in this 
                    game. The next game I had the opportunity. This ball, he get 
                    there, I don't know how. He make two big shots. It's not my 
                    day. Nothing to do. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Has becoming the US Open champion changed you in any way? 
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: In which way I have to change? Better or worse? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Either way. <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I have to change, of course. I have to bring 
                    something new. I have to learn something new because everybody 
                    know how to play against me. You have to bring something each 
                    day. You have to bring something new, make different game, 
                    volley, serve and volley, return volley. Just bring something, 
                    otherwise it's starting - now it's easy to play against me. 
                    Everybody knows what I'm going to do. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You've been under such a microscope in terms of media. 
                    Has that added a lot of pressure for you? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I'm trying to do my job. I mean, my job is to 
                    play tennis, make people happy, talk to you guys. I'm having 
                    fun right now. This is kind of a job, and I like it. That's 
                    my life, and I like it. Why I have to feel pressure? If something 
                    going wrong is because has to go wrong. I'm trying to do my 
                    best. I'm injured right now. When I'm going to be okay, I 
                    will try to win other tournaments. If it doesn't work, what 
                    can I do? I give my best every day. </font></p>
                  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><p>Q. Do you honestly think it's going to be enough time from 
                    now to Miami? When you were leaving Dubai, you thought the 
                    time from the end of Dubai to here was going to be enough. 
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I think it has to be okay. I spoke with my doctors. 
                    They said like it's going to take two weeks, maximum two, 
                    three weeks to be sure. I'm taking pills. I'm having treatment 
                    with the physios which is taking care of me. Unbelievable. 
                    Thanks a lot. I'm getting (inaudible) and everything into 
                    my body to be okay for Miami. I think I'm going to be okay. 
                    I hope so. </p>
                  <p>Q. Were you wearing a brace today of some kind? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No, it's okay. It's okay. </p>
                  <p>Q. The other day Pete Sampras said to us that he believes 
                    that the future of tennis is you and Guga. What do you think 
                    of that kind of statement? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: It's a difficult question because, I mean, when 
                    you ask the people, you coming somewhere to a tournament, 
                    yeah, we are new names, Kuerten is good player, Safin is okay, 
                    Hewitt is also okay. Ferrero is not bad, Federer. Two names, 
                    big names, Andre and Pete. That's it. For them is the best. 
                    They are Gods. We are just nothing special. &quot;Yes, he's 
                    okay. Future. Is okay, is the future.&quot; It's different 
                    story. Is not like before that every tournament the same people 
                    play in the quarterfinals. Now everything is equal, like guy 
                    from No. 1 up to 30 can beat. It's equal, many names. The 
                    people, they don't know us very well. They know, but we need 
                    time. Guys are promoting us and trying to do all the best, 
                    New Balls campaign. They're doing well. I think we'll need 
                    two, three years to be at least a little closer to these guys, 
                    Andre and Pete. It's impossible, but we're trying. Also these 
                    guys, I think they're trying also to promote us.</p>
                  <p>Q. The plan with Mats is Miami, and after that? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: If he don't like me, we stop. If he likes me, 
                    we talk about business.</p>
                  <p>Q. Does it go until after Miami? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I would like. I would like. I would like. I would 
                    like to convince him to work with me. I think it's going to 
                    work. I hope so.</p>
                  <p>Q. Before you got injured, what were your goals this year? 
                    Two Grand Slams? No. 1? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I definitely want to win another Grand Slam, 
                    I think I can make it, and stay in Top 5. I mean, is going 
                    to be difficult because Andre is playing very good. He won 
                    the Australian Open. Guga, Pete, Yevgeny, many guys. I'm one 
                    of them. For the moment, it doesn't go very well, but I'm 
                    fighting, I'm trying.</p>
                  <p>Q. Which Grand Slam do you think you have the best chance? 
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Roland Garros.</p>
                  <p>Q. So that's your major goal? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: That's my target.</p>
                  <p>Q. When you said you had three aspects to your job: play 
                    tennis, entertain the fans, and talk to us. Of those three, 
                    which is the most challenging, hardest? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Hardest? The hardest, to be nice to you. I mean, 
                    the most important thing is that you guys write quite well 
                    about us. Sometimes we have a bad day. Sometimes frustration. 
                    Like Philippoussis, he came to locker room. He was upset. 
                    He said many good words. You know, you have to understand 
                    sometimes people, Philippoussis, many guys like me, we feel 
                    frustration. I mean, if one day we are not nice to you, it's 
                    because we want to win and make people happy on the court. 
                    But sometimes it doesn't go this way. Sometimes we're not 
                    nice to you. Sorry, but you have to understand. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What were the many good words that Philippoussis said in 
                    the locker room? <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Ask him. He will tell you (laughter).<br>
                    <br>
