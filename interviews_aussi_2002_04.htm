                    Q. Marat, is it good or bad to play only seven games in a 
                    Quarter-final?<br>
<br>
A. Again?<br>
<br>
Q. Is it good or is it bad to play only seven games?<br>
<br>
A. Oh, I think it's just - for me it's great. I think so. 
                    I don't have to spend too much energy on the court and don't 
                    have to make a lot of kilometres on the court, and I can save 
                    my energy for the Semi-finals. I was lucky, yeah.<br>
<br>
Q. The match was so fast I almost didn't have a chance to 
                    get up to see how beautiful the bench was today?<br>
<br>
A. Today, was quite empty.<br>
<br>
Q. Empty?<br>
<br>
A. Yeah.<br>
<br>
Q. Any reason?<br>
<br>
A. No. Just some people, they have to work also; so not only 
                    me is work. I am not only the one who is working.<br>
<br>
Q. Maybe they knew you weren't going to work overtime today, 
                    so they didn't have to come?<br>
<br>
A. Maybe. But I think they have to make money, you know, 
                    by themselves also, so they can come to enjoy the tennis.<br>
<br>
Q. Looking back, now, with a bit of time, after beating Pete, 
                    how satisfied are you with the performance?<br>
<br>
A. I'm great. I'm feeling well. I'm confident, and I'm in 
                    Semi-finals. I'm feeling well and I want to have the bit opportunity 
                    to win. You know, I'm doing well, so I would love to win this 
                    tournament and I am, this time, closer and closer to the Final.<br>
<br>
Q. Easy tournament, seven games?<br>
<br>
A. Nothing is easy in this life. Sometimes you have to work 
                    a little bit more than normal, like I did against Pete. I 
                    think was a great match, so I deserved to win, and today was 
                    a present, I think.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, I was reading - I've actually been visiting your 
                    website and reading an interview you gave last year when you 
                    were talking about after the US Open, and you described it 
                    as this, almost like being on this wave, and you how just 
                    felt sort of indestructable, and like, you know, you'd just 
                    kept winning and it wouldn't stop. I just wonder whether you're 
                    getting any sense of that feeling back at the moment, the 
                    sort of tennis you play?<br>
<br>
A. No. But you have to be careful, you know, with this feeling, 
                    because it's not really good feeling. You know, if you feel 
                    a lot of confidence it's a little bit dangerous. So it's better, 
                    you know, be careful against who you are playing, and just 
                    go to the court, concentrate and just do your work, you know, 
                    just give everything that you have, and that's it. It's just 
                    two, three hours on the court. It's not so much. But you have 
                    to give, definitely, hundred per cent, and just show to the 
                    guy that you are better than him. I think that's the most 
                    important out there. Also the confidence, of course. With 
                    the confidence you play much better. But you have to be careful. 
                    It's quite dangerous.<br>
<br>
Q. Did you think that's a lesson that you learned from the 
                    - - -<br>
<br>
A. Yeah, I'm learning. You know, I'm growing up also, so 
                    you learn. You learn about everything.<br>
<br>
Q. Do you think you are a lot smarter than the bloke who 
                    won the US Open?<br>
<br>
A. Yeah, I think. But I have - I have like Chesnokov, Volkov 
                    and Wilander. They were my coaches, so you have to learn something 
                    from them. They are great players and just, you learn, you 
                    listen to them and just you keep it, try to keep everything 
                    in your head.<br>
<br>
Q. So have you talked to Wilander?<br>
<br>
A. No, not yet. I have to.<br>
<br>
Q. It's bad luck if you talk to him. It's better - - -<br>
<br>
A. I don't think so. I mean, Mats is very respectful guy 
                    and he is my friend. He work with me last year, and I hope 
                    that we are going to work this year also. And he explain me 
                    a lot about tennis but - he's working 2002; he didn't work 
                    2001, but he's working right now. That's good.<br>
<br>
Q. Mats also won a lot here; does that help?<br>
<br>
A. What can help?<br>
<br>
Q. Well, he won this tournament three times?<br>
<br>
A. But he's not playing, he's just coaching.<br>
<br>
Q. Has he helped you?<br>
<br>
A. Yes, of course he give you. But just, he gives you a lot 
                    of confidence, you know, so it make your life easier. I don't 
                    have any pressure, I'm playing better, and I feel comfortable 
                    on the court. These kind of things that just, he showed me 
                    last year. He explain to me in simple words and I understood 
                    them; and it's just, I'm working on them.<br>
<br>
Q. And did he help you prepare for this tournament?<br>
<br>
A. No. Just, I think it's, you have to be a little bit smarter 
                    on the court, you have to see right away what is going on 
                    on the court, how the opponent is playing, what is he doing, 
                    and all these kind of things. Small things that helps you 
                    a lot, that helps you to win the big matches, like against 
                    Sampras.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, what did you say to Wayne today after he retired?<br>
<br>
A. I just ask 'What is going on? What is the reason?' I mean, 
                    it's just - I think it's, you have to know what'S going on. 
                    I feel sorry. But also, I'm very lucky. I'm definitely very 
                    lucky to not playing there. Against Wayne, you never know 
                    what is going to happen, you know because he's a great player. 
                    He's playing great right now, and just, he couldn't run any 
                    more, I think. He was so tired. He played twice five sets, 
                    and he just pulled his muscle, I think, on the stomach.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, what would the achievement of winning a second 
                    Grand Slam title say about you as a competitor, as a player?<br>
<br>
A. First of all, I am just only in the Semi-final. I can 
                    tell you what is the feeling after the Final, if I get there. 
                    But for the moment I just, I have very difficult opponent, 
                    you know, next round. It's Rios or it's Haas. So I have to 
                    be careful and just to prepare myself, and then we will see.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, you have spoken before that you're not a fan for 
                    big long practice sessions. But because today didn't go very 
                    long, will you do anything different now over the next couple 
                    of days? What do you have to do to sort of make yourself right 
                    for the next match?<br>
<br>
A. No, because you cannot practice for a long time because, 
                    as you can see, it can be very hot. So you don't have to, 
                    you don't have to spend all your energy on the practice. You 
                    have to spend your energy on the court, you know, playing 
                    matches. So you have to - very important is the quality of 
                    the practice; not the hours you make. It's enough to make 
                    45 minutes, one hour, a day. But very good quality, and it's 
                    more than enough - just, feel the ball, feel the motion, and 
                    just keep your timing, and that's it.<br>
<br>
Q. So between now and your next match you'll probably have, 
                    what, just an hour, say, tomorrow?<br>
<br>
A. Yeah, not just - yeah, not more than that.<br>
<br>
Q. Yeah?<br>
<br>
A. Very simple practice, and enjoy.<br>
<br>
Q. And who are you going to practise with?<br>
<br>
A. Is not many players left, so I would have to find somebody. 
                    I hope some juniors, they would love to practise with me - 
                    I hope.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, they showed on TV today the little limp back to 
                    the woman, and all that. Have you talked to - you know, your 
                    thing on Saturday, I guess it was, against Youzhny, the problem 
                    with the ball woman, the linesman that you hit?<br>
<br>
A. Yeah, yeah.<br>
<br>
Q. And it didn't look very bad. Have you solved that whole 
                    problem? Have you talked to any of the other players? Did 
                    the other players say to you that &quot;This is crazy&quot;?<br>
<br>
A. No, nothing to say. I think I have no reasons to hit this 
                    woman. I have nothing against her. It's not - I apologise 
                    on the court and she said &quot;It's okay. It's not a problem&quot;. 
                    But just, I don't know, the chair umpire, he thought that 
                    was a big problem. But that's it. It's over. And I don't want 
                    to discuss it any more. It's gone.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, a lot more confidence on your forehand. Did beating 
                    Sampras help you there?<br>
<br>
A. Yeah, I'm feeling, feeling great for my forehand, and 
                    I'm moving well on the court, and I'm just - I mean, you have 
                    confidence, everything is much easier. You know, the serve 
                    is working, the backhand is perfect, the forehand is doing 
                    well, and that means confidence, that you are confident.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, what are your records against Rios and Haas?<br>
<br>
A. Haas.<br>
<br>
Q. What have your experiences been there when you've had 
                    to deal with them? <br>
<br>
A. I think against Rios I'm 2-1 up, and against Haas I'm 
                    2-1 down, or something like this. So it's just, I don't know, 
                    you have to<br>
                    - it's normal match. It's Semi-finals where everybody going 
                    to be nervous. Just play your game and try to do something 
                    as fast as you can, you know, just to find your game, find 
                    your confidence on the court, and that's it. That's going 
                    to be the key with the match.<br>
<br>
Q. Which one would you rather play, of the two?<br>
<br>
A. Which I prefer?<br>
<br>
Q. Yes. Or how would you play it differently against one 
                    or the other?<br>
<br>
A. Rios, I think, against Rios, you have - everybody knows 
                    that he is very talented. But he doesn't like to run, so it's 
                    - it's part of his game - so you have to move him a lot and 
                    just to stay with him. Against Haas, is the same thing, I 
                    think: just to stay, stay and fight and run, and just take 
                    your, take your chances. You have some small chances, then 
                    you have to take them.<br>
<br>
Q. Marat, did you ever, in your dark periods last year, feel 
                    that you might not regain your confidence and your high standing 
                    that had in 2000?<br>
<br>
A. I was afraid, of course. You have - I had this in my mind, 
                    you know, that I felt like I couldn't find my game. After 
                    the injury I couldn't play, you know, I couldn't find my game 
                    at all, and nothing was working, and just, I didn't know what 
                    to do. But then, slowly, slowly, I won two tournaments, I 
                    make Semi-final in US Open, and Quarter-finals Wimbledon. 
                    And then, more less I played, I could play tennis. But at 
                    the beginning, you know, like in May and up to Wimbledon, 
                    I couldn't play at all. I just was, I felt so bad. At the 
                    end was, was more or less okay. But then I didn't expect many 
                    things from the last year, so I just start preparing for this 
                    year. So that was my goal, because I couldn't finish No. 1 
                    in the world last year; so particularly I tried to do my best 
                    and play some more tournaments and try to do my best. But 
                    it's difficult to play when you cannot be, you cannot fight 
                    for the top, for the top.<br>
<br>
Q. Was it depressing, looking for this game and not finding 
                    it?<br>
<br>
A. It's depressing, it's difficult, and you have to spend 
                    a lot of hours, and just practising, practising; it doesn't 
                    come, it doesn't come. It seems like it's coming right now, 
                    so it was good that I stayed there. I didn't - and I never 
                    give up, and I practice, and I spend a lot of hours and now 
                    it's working, so I hope that tomorrow will be successful. 
                 <br>
<br>
Q. So that's a positive thing too, that you didn't give up 
                    when you were depressed never. ?<br>
<br>
A. Never give up. Last year, I was trying to give up but 
                    I couldn't.<br>
<br>
Q. What was the part of your game that you developed the 
                    most in the past year, do you feel?<br>
<br>
A. I just, I improve my volley. But I didn't go to the net 
                    at all here. I had no chance to go there, and then I had no 
                    - I play against Sampras, and I think everybody knows that 
                    if you go to the net with him you have no chance to beat him, 
                    because he has the great passing shots and you have to be 
                    careful. So it's - against Sampras, you don't have to go to 
                    the net very often. Just, maybe, we will see. Maybe in next 
                    tournaments, maybe I'll make serve and volley. We will see 
                    that I improve my game.<br>
