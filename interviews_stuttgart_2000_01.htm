                        the six meetings between the two and he did so in two

                  MODERATOR: </b>Questions for Marat, who overcame his 5-0 deficit 
                  from Santoro. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> How does it feel?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Best day in my life.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>What did you do better today than the other days? 
                  <br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> I just tried to convince myself that I have 
                  enough game and I have enough power to beat him. I have everything, 
                  but it was just mental problems. I was scared already before 
                  the match, and it's difficult to play like this. I play today 
                  like against a normal guy. I try to make what I have to do. 
                  I knew that sometimes in some moments I will have to rush a 
                  little bit, you know, to risk. But I think I played in the right 
                  way and I make the things great. Not perfect, but I made my 
                  game. It's more important.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Did you feel frustrated at the beginning of the match, 
                  first couple of games? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, I was really scared at the beginning 
                  of the match. When I went to the court, I was very scared. My 
                  serve in the first game didn't work. I couldn't run. I was very, 
                  very nervous. I couldn't play my game. But just after two games, 
                  I start to run, I play my game, and I start to build, you know, 
                  point by point and try to make my things. I didn't look at him, 
                  what he was doing, because when you look at him, you forget 
                  how to play tennis, for sure. You know, you start to risk, you 
                  start to make some crazy things, dropshots. So just I had to 
                  play my game, that's it. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> How important was it for you to get out of that 4-All, 
                  15-40 in the second set?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> 15-40?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>Yes.<br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> I don't know. I played my game like I played 
                  before. Why I made 15-40? I miss two shots that normally they 
                  have to go inside the court. After this, I try to make the same 
                  game, and I made it. Probably I was lucky because he hit two 
                  times in the net. If it's a little bit higher, it's a point, 
                  probably a set. But I just made my game, even when I was down. 
                  I'm satisfied that I didn't get scared, I didn't get paralyzed 
                  on the court.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>So you can forget all about this now and just play 
                  naturally next time? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I hope so I can forget. It would be great. 
                  I think it's next step in my life, in my game. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>Was he the only one? Is he the only guy on the tour 
                  that --? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yes. He's the only person in this world 
                  who can beat me - no, I mean who beat me five times in a row 
                  without any problems. All my respect to other players, but I 
                  don't want to say the other ones don't know how to play tennis. 
                  This is the only one who can drive me crazy on the court like 
                  he did already for two years.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>How do you look forward to the Rusedski match next? 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> It will be decided probably two, three points. 
                  Just you have to pay a lot of attention on the return. If I 
                  hold my serve, I have to put pressure on the return. I mean, 
                  from the baseline, I'm better than him. He is better in the 
                  volley. But I think the courts are slow enough, go from the 
                  baseline and just try to hold the serve, try to push on the 
                  return. Just try to make your game.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>He's serving very well at the moment, isn't he? <br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: </b>Yes. That's why I'm telling you I have to pay 
                  a lot of attention on the return, because it's going to be one, 
                  two points in each game that's going to decide probably the 
                  set. Who going to be more lucky, who going to be a little bit 
                  more concentrated at the moment going to win. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> What have been the big changes for you since the US 
                  Open?<br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> I mean, big changes, no. The things, they've 
                  been going the right direction probably. I mean, I want to say 
                  that I play against Fabrice in the Olympic Games. I went there 
                  with all the confidence of the world, and he drove me crazy 
                  one more time. It was 6-4 in the third. Then I came to Vienna, 
                  another French guy, he drive me crazy, 7-6 in the third. I was 
                  unlucky probably. Then I went to Moscow, I lost in semifinal. 
                  But already I didn't play my best tennis. Here I try now. With 
                  the match of today, I feel comfortable. I feel okay - better 
                  than that month before.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> What makes you feel more comfortable? <br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> Just because sometimes you feel uncomfortable 
                  with your shots or you're running not in the right direction 
                  because you don't feel the game sometimes. Now you feel the 
                  game, you play a bit easier. You just to get to play inside 
                  of the court. Sometimes when you are out of confidence, you 
                  don't see what going to happen in the next shot, where the opponent 
                  going to put the ball. But when you're with your confidence, 
                  you can see it. This is more important, to get confidence back. 
                  It can make your tennis easier. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Is that the first time you'd been back to Moscow since 
                  winning the US Open?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Did you notice a change in how you were viewed by 
                  the people? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think the people, they were perfect, but 
                  sometimes they want too much from me, because they think if 
                  I won the US Open, I have to win all of the tournaments of the 
                  world. Is not possible. Also, of course when you go back to 
                  home, you want to give everything for the people, you want to 
                  make them satisfied with your game. Already you get scared when 
                  you go onto the court because there is 5,000, 10,000 people 
                  watching you. They want more and more each time. It's tough 
                  to play also because I made a lot of press. I think it's important 
                  because the people, they want to know you a little bit more. 
                  It was a little bit tough, but I think next year I'll be perfect 
                  there. I have used to do this. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>With you winning the US and Kafelnikov winning the 
                  Olympic gold medal, how big are tennis players in Russia compared 
                  to, say, soccer players, athletes? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think the tennis is going up in Russia. 
                  You see we have Kournikova, they drives everybody crazy. Dementieva, 
                  also she's coming out. I don't know, she's Top 20, for sure. 
                  She's making great tennis. Also Yevgeny. I'm going inside there 
                  upstairs. I think it's very important for us and for the country 
                  that we are improving our tennis. Also it's very nice, I think.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>You have quite a lot of junior girls coming through 
                  in Russia. What about junior boys?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> They're there. I know the ranking sometimes 
                  doesn't matter. There is one guy, he's 117. They can be in the 
                  Top 100 right now, in the next month. For sure they going to 
                  be next year, I promise. If not, I stop to play tennis, if you 
                  want (laughter). Another few guys like 220, 300, but you can 
                  see the potential. They can be Top 100. They can be there, but 
                  they need some help, they need some good advices. But I think 
                  it's going -- we need one more year, one year and a half to 
                  get all the guys in the Top 100 because there is the talent.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Has Youzhny got the potential to get up there with 
                  you and Yevgeny?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I don't think so. I don't want to offend 
                  him, but he's too young. I think, first of all, he has to make 
                  it to the Top 100, first step. Second step is the Top 50. Third 
                  step is already Top 20. If he can pass all these steps, if he 
                  is Top 50, maybe I would change my mind. For the moment, no. 
                  Also the kid, he said that he discussed about how to play against 
                  Fabrice. He said he didn't ask Marat Safin, but he asked another 
                  person. I mean, what is this?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>You said "step-by-step." Now you are top two. What 
                  is your next step?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> No. 1, and after I retired. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> How will you say it's advisable for young Russians 
                  to follow your example, to train abroad? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think everybody going out because it's 
                  difficult to practice in Russia. It's different life. You don't 
                  have many things for practice there. I mean, all the guys are 
                  going to Germany, coming to Spain. I think they're making good 
                  choices because it's a big school there, Germany, Spain especially. 
                  It's very good school for the young players. You can see how 
                  many, 14 Spanish guys in the Top 100. Spain is quite small. 
                  I mean, it means there's a lot of potential there. It's very 
                  important for them to start there because there's satellites, 
                  you have to pass through all the satellites. I don't understand 
                  when the Russian goes to Japan. I don't want to say anything 
                  against the people who are going there, but I think is more 
                  important to go to Spain and try your power there. If you are 
                  good there, don't worry, you going to be Top 100.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>What is the biggest problem? Lack of facilities to 
                  be able to play or lack of top coaches? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Probably both things. There are futures, 
                  satellites, but it's not enough schools, not enough, how to 
                  say, to start with it because there's not enough level. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Not enough people playing the game?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Also. You go to Spain, you see the draw. 
                  It looks likes challenger. I think it's more important.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Do you see facilities improving? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Facilities is not a problem. You can practice 
                  there. I'm telling you, the level of tournaments is not enough. 
                  Also, of course, there is a lot more people in Spain practicing 
                  there, a lot more level. You can find, but it's a little difficult. 
                  Everybody is traveling all the year. In Spain, for sure, you 
                  don't have to move a lot. In Spain you have everything, challengers, 
                  satellites, futures, two ATP tours. You don't have to spend 
                  a lot of money. You playing in a good level. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Are you back full-time with your Spanish coach now?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Yes. We're trying to, until the end of the 
                  year. I don't want to promise anything. I didn't want to promise 
                  anything to him. I just want to see - have to be sure what is 
                  going on. I have to be sure in my head what I want. For the 
                  moment, this is until the end of the year. After, we see. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Are you still talking to Tony Pickard from time to 
                  time? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yes. He called me when I was in Moscow. 
                  It was some good advices.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Will you talk to him before playing Rusedski? <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No. I have my head also. I have a brain. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> You know what you need to do against Rusedski?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I know. I know. But if I can do this. I 
                  play twice, so at least I know how I have to act on the court. 
                  Just if I can do it, I can beat him. If I will not do this, 
                  these things, it will be a little bit more difficult. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> You were saying with your old coach in Spain that 
                  the problem you found was that you reached the point where he 
                  was talking to you more like a father than a coach, you weren't 
                  listening anymore, even though people like Chesnokov said the 
                  same things to you, you would listen to them because maybe it 
                  was a different voice. Have you come to terms with that since 
                  you returned to your old coach?<br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> No, it's just I thought -- I thought about 
                  this when I played the USA. I sit alone, myself, me and myself. 
                  Because I'm a different person, I think on the court I'm a different 
                  guy, different mentality, and we can arrange it to try to try 
                  again. I'm not tanking any more matches, I'm not doing stupid 
                  things anymore. Maybe it can work. For the moment, is going 
                  in the right direction. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> About the court itself here, we've heard that the 
                  court is fairly slow for indoors, but maybe because of the altitude 
                  the balls are flying pretty quick. Have you found that, as well? 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah. The courts are slow. I think is okay 
                  because also we're playing for spectators, first of all. If 
                  tennis want to survive, we have to do something. If it's very 
                  fast, you don't see any points, any rallies. Nobody will give 
                  any money, no sponsorship. We need to do something with this. 
                  I think that's why ATP, they make it a little bit slower so 
                  at least there's some rallies, it's more interesting. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> But the balls are flying?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, they're flying. It's a question of 
                  two, three days, just pay more attention. We have enough experience 
                  with this, so it's just one, two days, no problem. <br>
