                    An Interview With: MARAT SAFIN<br>
                    <br>
                    ATP: Questions, please.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Well done. Do you feel you are starting to pick up a bit 
                    of form now?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, I am glad that I am backing in, trying 
                    to get my confidence back. I am feeling okay and I hope I 
                    will be perfect already this week, can make some results and 
                    I can play my best tennis as soon as possible. That is very 
                    important for me because I will need everything for French 
                    Open.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Is that the best you have served since you were injured?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. I served much better. I feel okay and just 
                    I need to win some matches before the French Open.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Before when you were serving not at full pace, was that 
                    still a physical problem or was it a mental?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No, more mental because I mean, I am okay actually. 
                    But sometimes muscles get tight because, I didn't work for 
                    actually for one month and a half, I couldn't do many exercises 
                    with my back because otherwise it gets worse and worse. So 
                    I tried to warm-up a little bit and then I start to serve 
                    full power and I think okay.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Is the warming down also important for the back as well 
                    as the warming up?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, of course. If you don't take care of it 
                    -- it is a very special part of my body.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. I saw you flexing a little bit during the match. It was 
                    all right?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: It is okay. I am happy. I am satisfied for the 
                    first round. Also the conditions are not so great. I mean, 
                    because it is cold, no sun, and courts are little bit soft 
                    so they bounce and baseline is a little bit, not very good 
                    because I think I am moving too much there and the courts 
                    are not -- not perfect.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How much is Mats Wilander helping you and how much is he 
                    helping you mentally in particular?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I think it is very important to have the confidence 
                    that the coach give you confidence, enough confidence to make 
                    you play better and better even if you are playing not great 
                    tennis, he has to give you confidence because as soon as -- 
                    I mean, when start to give you confidence, nothing happens, 
                    okay, that is trying, not playing, okay, come on, you are 
                    playing okay, you start to realize actually you are not so 
                    bad. You get confidence much faster than when you are just 
                    too long down and just trying to win one match for few weeks. 
                    That is why I need Mats to give me confidence so can pass 
                    this period for one, two weeks maximum.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Has he been with you at all between Key Biscayne and here 
                    because you have been injured?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I was with him one week practicing and now.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Where was that?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: In Monte Carlo.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. He is through with you now through the end of Wimbledon 
                    or what?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I don't know. <br>
                    <br>
                    (Laughs) no, because I think he has some things to do and 
                    he is coming Thursday or Wednesday before French Open. So 
                    goes for two days and he is coming back.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Have you felt you spent too long on the Tour maybe either 
                    on your own or with different people with you and no consistent 
                    companion?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Of course, every person is bringing something 
                    new and first of all, the person if you start to work with 
                    somebody you have to get to know him. You can't start working 
                    with a guy if you never talk to him and you don't know, he 
                    has to know how are you, who you are, actually, I mean, it 
                    takes a few weeks until you start to understand each other 
                    and start to working.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What has been the lowest point for you in the last few 
                    weeks?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Monte Carlo. I mean, worse it cannot be. I think 
                    it was like no comments.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. In a way do you feel that you are actually starting your 
                    year again now?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: It is a little bit too late, I think, to start 
                    the year, we are already in May and I will try to make -- 
                    difficult now to talk if I can finish No. 1, No. 2, Top-3 
                    - very difficult because I mean, the guys like Andre, Kuerten, 
                    Ferrero is playing great tennis. It is very difficult to catch 
                    them. I hope that they have -- they can play normal tennis 
                    and wait for me a few weeks and after I can go with them, 
                    I don't know, forward. It is a little bit difficult. So I 
                    will try to -- I would like to make -- finish the year at 
                    least in the Masters, it would be great for me.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Are you looking forward to the hard court season?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. I have to. The clay court is already finishing. 
                    It is like French Open, two weeks more. Then the grass coming 
                    so actually I have chance probably I will try to make some 
                    results there and then starting the USA again.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You are breaking anymore rackets this year?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but less. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Much less?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Less. Less.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Is that due in part to Mats Wilander?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, I get fined with him.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How much?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: $100.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. For each racket?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, it's enough, no? <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. He wants you to break more?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I don't want to make him rich.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. When did you start your new contract with Dunlop?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Miami. They couldn't give me so much racket so 
                    I have to buy them.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Any likelihood of you talking to Pickard during Wimbledon 
                    or not?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: He is a good friend of mine, but I have a coach, 
                    I have to respect my coach. But I think it would be ---<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. He knows Mats well.<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Not a problem. But it's okay, I can -- now at 
                    least I have a coach, a stable coach and I am very glad and 
                    very happy so I'd like to spend all the time with him to learn. 
                    Also I have to make some results here so I have to listen 
                    to him.<br>
                    <br>
