                  <br>
                  Marat Safin is the future of tennis. Who says so? Well Pete 
                  Sampras, among many others. The man who will be king talks to 
                  Tim Adams about success, successions and celebrity <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Palm Springs is where corporate Californians come to die, the 
                  happy hunting ground of the golden state. Time here is measured 
                  out in long, air-conditioned days behind the high walls and 
                  digitally operated drawbridges of country clubs; by night the 
                  only signs of life are the thousands of automatic sprinklers 
                  which irrigate the desert's 100 impossibly verdant golf courses. 
                  Beyond this manicured green belt, snow-topped mountains rise 
                  up too high and fast from the dusty plain. These peaks form 
                  the stage-set backdrop for the city's one-week-a-year shrine 
                  to eternal youth: the Indian Wells tennis tournament.<br>
                  <br>
                  The new purpose-built stadium for this ritual event is almost 
                  cruelly vertiginous too, and each time play gets under way on 
                  court some of the more elderly locals are inevitably still feeling 
                  their way toward their seats, shuffling gingerly down steepling 
                  aisles, trying to decipher their ticket stubs through the wrong 
                  glasses, deaf to the patient promptings of an umpire asking 
                  them to hurry. There is a curious quiet everywhere. The only 
                  noise in the hot desert air, apart from the low thwack of balls, 
                  comes from the tennis village outside where a Simon and Garfunkel 
                  soundalike duo, Sounds of Silence, run through their acoustic 
                  repertoire and, every afternoon, Nick Bolletieri, tennis guru 
                  to the stars, explains on stage how terribly strange it feels 
                  to be seventy.<br>
                  <br>
                  In among the taco bars and power juice tents Silicon Valley 
                  snake-oil salesmen offer wrinkle creams and anti-ageing elixirs 
                  to ever hopeful disciples. It seems they need hardly bother: 
                  out on the practice courts nearby there seems enough energetic 
                  life force for it to be bottled, or received by osmosis. It 
                  is perhaps for this reason that a large woman, carrying two 
                  giant Slush Puppies, a small sack of pretzels and an oversized 
                  tennis ball, is breaking into an unaccustomed trot down the 
                  main concourse in the midday sun. She seems to have identified 
                  an urgent need to be in close proximity to some of this carefree 
                  physical power.<br>
                  <br>
                  As she jogs, sunglasses bouncing on the bridge of her nose, 
                  sweat breaking on her shoulders, her vast shorts straining to 
                  contain the geographical expanse of her behind, she calls to 
                  her friend, who is a few yards off her pace, to keep up. Then, 
                  nearing the court, where a crowd of like-minded over-nourished 
                  souls is already gathering, she half-turns to see her companion 
                  dropping back into the throng, and stage whispers one last exhortation: 
                  'It's a big Russian guy,' she says, holding her place with one 
                  vast arm through the swelling crowd, 'and he's wearing some 
                  kind of pantyhose.'<br>
                  <br>
                  The big Russian guy in question, Marat Safin, 21 years old, 
                  the reigning US Open champion, and tennis's undisputed Next 
                  Big Thing, is indeed on court wearing a flesh-coloured reinforced 
                  girdle and baggy check shorts. He stands around six foot six 
                  in his technologically sculpted trainers, has a crew cut, the 
                  torso of a heavyweight boxer, and what look like dog tags around 
                  his neck. The girdle, which could be a surgical bandage, gives 
                  him the appearance of a war hero, and he is addressing the ball 
                  with something like the pent-up ferocity of a battle-fatigued 
                  conscript, smiling occasionally as if at his own easy aggression, 
                  and every so often feeling his rib cage where a troublesome 
                  muscle injury has kept him out of the previous three tournaments 
                  and threatens his participation in this one. <br>
                  <br>
                  At courtside, next to me, two teenage girls, giggling, smitten, 
                  are also concerned about Safin's back; in particular about the 
                  passionate provenance of a line of five parallel scratch marks 
                  just under his shoulder blade.<br>
                  <br>
                  In one corner of the court, by way of contrast to the intimidating 
                  presence of the Russian, is Mats Wilander, the winner of six 
                  grand slams, who today has embarked on a new life as Marat Safin's 
                  coach, the latest in a longish line. Wilander, a wiry figure, 
                  bandy legged, is watching his charge from behind Lennon-framed 
                  shades with a half-smile on his face, occasionally throwing 
                  Safin a ball and asking him how his injured ribs are holding 
                  up. 'There is pain,' Safin mutters darkly, 'but the doctor said 
                  there would be pain. Pain is normal.'<br>
                  <br>
                  Wilander is the only person in the stadium complex, and probably 
                  in the whole of Palm Springs, who is wearing clothes that do 
                  not appear to have been removed from their branded packaging 
                  that morning: he has on a washed-out khaki sweat top and well-travelled 
                  green shorts; his rackets are in beaten-up holdall; he hasn't 
                  shaved. His coaching, in this debut session, is limited to wry 
                  glances and the odd cryptic comment: 'Sometimes the balls look 
                  big here and sometimes they look small,' he says at one point. 
                  Safin nods agreement. 'They look pretty big today,' he says.<br>
                  When the pair eventually wander back the couple of hundred yards 
                  to the locker room, they lose each other on the way. Wilander, 
                  in his veteran kit, is allowed to pass through the crowds unmolested 
                  and unrecognised while a gaggle of fame-seekers swarms around 
                  the legs of the giant Safin, some touching his flesh or his 
                  corset as if to confirm he is real. The woman with the outsize 
                  ball holds it up for him to sign, and then studies the signature. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  'What's your name?' she yells at him.<br>
                  <br>
                  'Safin,' comes the smiling reply, 'Marat Safin.'<br>
                  <br>
                  And she goes off to repeat it, incorrectly, to her friend.<br>
                  <br>
                  It is a fair bet that it won't be long before most of us know 
                  Marat Safin's revolutionary name rather well. The day before 
                  he arrived here, I watched Pete Sampras, whose game Safin dismantled 
                  at Flushing Meadow, speak of the young Russian with something 
                  approaching awe. As he talked about Safin as 'the future', Sampras's 
                  weary body language clearly remembered the September afternoon 
                  in New York last year when his young opponent made him look 
                  like a balding 29-year-old who had just got married and had 
                  $100 million in the bank: a man who, having overwhelmed the 
                  court for a decade, suddenly found himself diminishing in stature 
                  point by point. <br>
                  <br>
                  The impression - despite Sampras's protestations to the contrary, 
                  and an avenging defeat towards the end of last season - has 
                  undoubtedly stuck. Tennis has long looked for a natural heir 
                  to the Agassi-Becker-Sampras generation: in Safin, to Sampras's 
                  eyes at least, it would seem the pretender has arrived.<br>
                  <br>
                  Off court, showered, and sprawled on a sofa in the player's 
                  lounge, Safin seems even bigger than he did whacking backhands 
                  in the afternoon sun. Though he is surrounded here by men of 
                  similar gargantuan build - Goran Ivanesevic, his hero and role 
                  model, is playing table tennis nearby (and losing, stylishly), 
                  Mark Phillipoussis is checking the draw on a TV screen - Safin 
                  generates an extra presence born of extreme physical confidence. 
                  He seems in no doubt he is an alpha male in this exalted company, 
                  the challenge now is getting the public to realise it, too. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  'It's a little bit of a difficult time for us new guys,' he 
                  says, by which he means Gustavo Kuerten, and Lleyton Hewitt 
                  and Juan Carlos Ferrero in particular, 'because no one actually 
                  knows us very well still. They still think that Pete and Andre 
                  are the only players to see. They don't realise we are around 
                  yet.'<br>
                  <br>
                  So does he think that it's time Sampras and Agassi called it 
                  a day? 'No,' he says, with his lugubrious Russian inflection, 
                  'we need them for a while longer so people still come and the 
                  prize money stays high.' He smiles slowly. 'When the fans know 
                  us, then those guys can go quietly. . .'<br>
                  <br>
                  There are certain subjects that tennis players traditionally 
                  will not talk about in interview. These include their interior 
                  life; other players; romance; money; emotions; politics and 
                  ideas. The things they will talk about, in their place, generally 
                  involve the current trajectory of their ball toss, and the particular 
                  degree of their focus on the coming match. Among the press corps 
                  who witness the mandatory post-match interviews, Safin is considered 
                  something of an exception to this rule. Veterans of a thousand 
                  quote-free Q &amp; As with Henman ('he raised his level at a 
                  crucial time') or Hingis ('I raised my level at a crucial time') 
                  have warmed to the Russian - who doled out irony and vodka to 
                  the hacks in Flushing Meadow - as something of a raconteur. 
                  The distinction, you have to say, is a fine one, however.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin can rattle off the story of his efforts to hold on to 
                  the No 1 ranking at the end of last year's Masters race in Muscovite 
                  shorthand - 'I make what I could; for the final I was unlucky; 
                  he was better this day. That's life' - and he has off-pat the 
                  particular reasons for his sluggish start to the season. His 
                  back, his back and his back. <br>
                  <br>
                  But ask him about life off court and he will tend to reply in 
                  a series of upbeat catch-all catchphrases, generally delivered 
                  with a raised eyebrow that hints at greater complexity: <br>
                  'I enjoy my life'<br>
                  <br>
                  'I just want to people to enjoy themselves'<br>
                  <br>
                  'I am very happy'<br>
                  <br>
                  'I just want to make everyone happy' <br>
                  <br>
                  In America, People magazine recently named Safin one of the 
                  25 most intriguing people in the world, and in a way you can 
                  see its point. As an interviewee Safin serves up some of the 
                  same contradictions he reveals on court: he is both relaxed 
                  and intense, boyish and self-assured, all-conquering and oddly 
                  fragile.<br>
                  <br>
                  Some of this perhaps has to do with his upbringing. Like nearly 
                  all modern players, he was born into a tennis dynasty: his mother 
                  was a top 10 player in Russia , his father ran the Spartak club 
                  in Moscow, one of the very few serious tennis clubs in the Soviet 
                  Union at that time. Safin, who began playing aged three, was 
                  schooled in the regimen of Eastern Bloc sports stars, but when 
                  he was 13 his parents decided to take advantage of the liberalised 
                  political climate and sent him abroad, to a tennis school in 
                  Valencia, to develop his game further. There, he was taken under 
                  the wing of the Spanish coach Rafael Mensua, who seems to have 
                  instilled in Safin not only those enormous groundstrokes, but 
                  also a certain flexibility of thought. He was obliged nevertheless 
                  to fend for himself. Looking back, I wonder if he resented being 
                  sent away from his family at an early age?<br>
                  <br>
                  'No,' he says, eyebrow raised. 'I am very, very happy about 
                  that.'<br>
                  <br>
                  Why exactly?<br>
                  <br>
                  'I think as a guy you need a little bit to be on your own from 
                  early on, to start to live your own life, and try to understand 
                  what is going on around you, you have to be able to survive. 
                  . .'<br>
                  <br>
                  He contrasts his situation with that of his 14-year-old sister, 
                  who is the top-ranked Russian junior in an increasingly competitive 
                  field. 'My parents now work full-time to take care of her, because 
                  the most important thing of course is to make a family. They 
                  now try to give my sister the things I could not have because 
                  I was away.'<br>
                  <br>
                  Does he regret at all not having had that support himself?<br>
                  <br>
                  'No,' he says. 'I am happy. I am very, very happy that I did 
                  not have all these things. . .' (Later, when I speak to his 
                  sister, Dinara, who is playing in Spain, her mother in attendance, 
                  she seems to have inherited the family's capacity for boundless 
                  contentment: 'I am extremely happy to have Marat's example,' 
                  she says, 'and very happy to be playing my own game here, too.')<br>
                  <br>
                  When Safin started to achieve a measure of success, he left 
                  Spain and went to live in Monte Carlo, which is home to about 
                  half of the top ranked European players on the tour. It is also 
                  the power base of Ion Tiriac, the Romanian tennis svengali who 
                  was Ilie Nastase's doubles partner. Tiriac, whose company now 
                  manages Safin's business interests, compares him to a young 
                  Boris Becker, not so much in his style of play - for all his 
                  reach, the Russian still tends to win his points from the back 
                  of the court rather than at the net - but for the way he believes 
                  in 'the purity and simplicity of just playing tennis'.<br>
                  <br>
                  This faith seems to manifest itself in different ways: when 
                  things are going well it gives the Russian's game the promise 
                  of an almost beatific ease. But when things are going badly, 
                  as with Becker, it can unleash demons. At the end of his first 
                  punishing year on the tour, Safin admitted to having broken 
                  48 rackets in anger, more than one per tournament. He puts this 
                  down now to 'the way I am', and the fact that 'no one likes 
                  to lose. I'm just trying to do all I can to beat the other guy. 
                  You get nervous and angry. But if you don't like to see the 
                  way I play, don't come.' (In fact, so certain are the tennis 
                  authorities that this violent emotion is, in fact, what crowds 
                  do want to see, and so anxious are they to create 'characters' 
                  in the game, that they have relaxed the laws on 'racket abuse', 
                  apparently for Safin's benefit.)<br>
                  <br>
                  For all this ferocious will to win, however, Safin remains the 
                  only player on the modern tour ever to have been pulled up for 
                  'tanking' in matches: throwing games by not trying. He was fined 
                  $2,000 for this offence at the Australian Open last year: the 
                  referee suggesting that he gave up in his first-round match 
                  against the South African Grant Stafford, and apparently, on 
                  one point, caught his opponent's serve in his hand and tossed 
                  it back underarm. Safin denies this incident happened, and claims, 
                  still annoyed at the implication, that 'people made a bigger 
                  story from this than it was. The guy who handed out the fine, 
                  obviously he knows much more about tennis and much more about 
                  me than I do. He's a very smart guy. Very smart. . .'<br>
                  <br>
                  Still, such incidents point to a psychology somewhat at odds 
                  with Safin's laid-back off-court persona. Does he recognise 
                  the contradiction in himself?<br>
                  <br>
                  'Oh,' he smiles, predictably, these days he's 'very happy off 
                  court and on', and anyway he has been breaking far fewer rackets 
                  of late.<br>
                  <br>
                  Does he manage to find enough distractions in Monte Carlo? I 
                  wonder.<br>
                  <br>
                  He laughs a little: 'I try to do my best to have fun off the 
                  court,' he says. 'You are only 21 once. I am aware I will never 
                  get back to this time. You cannot make big parties, you cannot 
                  take cocaine or whatever, obviously, but there are plenty of 
                  other ways of having fun. And anything you can do you ought 
                  to do I think.'<br>
                  <br>
                  Such as? <br>
                  <br>
                  He searches for an appropriate vice, grinning. 'Oh, cars,' he 
                  says, 'cars, cars, cars, so many cars.'<br>
                  <br>
                  Does he ever find it hard to concentrate on playing?<br>
                  <br>
                  He looks around the room, studies the pool players, smiles at 
                  compatriot Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who is sitting at the next table, 
                  'No,' he says finally, eyebrows raised. 'It's not hard to concentrate. 
                  It's all business to me and this business is a business I like 
                  very much.'<br>
                  <br>
                  There have been times in his career when this sense of well-being 
                  has seemed like a distant prospect, however: as recently as 
                  a year ago, at Indian Wells, Safin was considering giving up 
                  the game for good. The man who changed his mind then was Andrei 
                  Chesnokov, the former Russian Davis Cup player, who has known 
                  him since he himself was a boy training at the Spartak club 
                  and Safin's mother used to bring her baby to courtside in a 
                  pram.<br>
                  <br>
                  Speaking from Paris, where he is playing, Chesnokov explains 
                  that by the time Safin was 13 he could see that he was going 
                  to be a very great player - 'he had very good hands, a perfect 
                  feeling for the ball, he always saw it early and hit it with 
                  great power' Subsequently he saw the prodigy come of age, beating 
                  Agassi at Roland Garros in 1998 as a qualifier. Two years later, 
                  though, out of the blue, Chesnokov got a call from 'one of Marat's 
                  agents', as he says, who told him that Safin no longer wanted 
                  to play at all; after a run of dramatically poor results he 
                  was thinking of quitting the game. The agent wondered if a Russian 
                  might be able to help, someone he could communicate properly 
                  with.<br>
                  <br>
                  The first thing that Chesnokov tried to establish was that Safin 
                  had informed his mentor Mensua that he was seeking a new coach. 
                  He hadn't, so it was a few weeks before the pair joined up, 
                  at Barcelona. Safin had, at that stage, won four matches in 
                  five months. On the practice court, Chesnokov says, he just 
                  watched him without speaking for an hour. 'Then I said to him, 
                  &quot;The way you practise is no way to practise.&quot; His 
                  mind was not on the court, he was talking to people as they 
                  walked by, always looking around for what was going on. And 
                  he was trying to hit every ball as hard as he could.' <br>
                  <br>
                  Chesnokov says that he did not coach Safin, so much as help 
                  him get his head together; but the results were immediate. He 
                  won in Barcelona and then again the following week in Mallorca. 
                  In a few months his ranking went from 123 in the world to No 
                  9. Looking back on that change of fortunes now, Safin recalls 
                  how, previously, 'If I was playing good, I was playing unbelievable, 
                  but when I was playing bad, I couldn't beat my mother. [With 
                  Andrei] I started to practise with my head, not my strokes and 
                  everything came together.'<br>
                  <br>
                  Oddly, the relationship did not last. Characteristically, it 
                  seems, having learnt what he thought he could from his friend 
                  the single-minded Safin simply moved on. After the French Open 
                  Chesnokov heard that Safin had gone to practise on grass with 
                  Tony Pickard, Stefan Edberg's former coach. There was no phone 
                  call, no explanation. ('Why would he do that, when we had just 
                  won everything together?' Chesnokov still wonders). When he 
                  called the office of Safin's agent, at the time, he says someone 
                  told him: 'Don't you fuck with us.' The pair, not surprisingly 
                  have hardly spoken since though Safin, when he is listing his 
                  closest friends, still numbers Chesnokov among them. 'I can 
                  talk to Andrei, for example, about anything,' he says, apparently 
                  oblivious to the bad feeling he has caused.<br>
                  <br>
                  In some ways, Safin has many reasons to be thankful to players 
                  like Chesnokov , and not just for helping him get his game back 
                  on course. In recent years with the on-court success of the 
                  likes of Kafelnikov and the off-court success of Anna Kournikova, 
                  tennis has become more popular than ever in Russia, and there 
                  is a whole group of young players ready to follow in Safin's 
                  size elevens. Yet a generation ago tennis was hardly even recognised 
                  as a sport, and dismissed as bourgeois by the Olympic-obsessed 
                  Soviet authorities. When Chesnokov first played the game at 
                  school in the Seventies he went home and told his family that 
                  he was going to be a tennis player, and they had never heard 
                  of the game. Even in the Eighties when people asked him about 
                  what he did, and he explained, everyone would assume he was 
                  a table tennis star.<br>
                  <br>
                  It would take many days, he tells me a little wearily, to describe 
                  the particular differences between his era and Safin's but he 
                  names a few: for a start it was almost impossible to travel; 
                  for another thing, Russian players could not compete in tournaments 
                  that included South Africans or Israelis; and wherever he went 
                  Chesnokov had the KGB with him, too, making sure he did not 
                  fraternise with the wrong people. Things began to change with 
                  glasnost, and the game really took a hold under Yeltsin, who 
                  was himself a keen player. Now, tennis is Russia's fastest growing 
                  sport.<br>
                  <br>
                  When he looks at the earning potential of the likes of Safin 
                  now, Chesnokov says, he wishes them good luck and does not dwell 
                  on the fact that at their age he was not allowed to claim any 
                  prize money. He is philosophical, too, about the different pressures 
                  players like Safin are now under. Does he think, I wonder, given 
                  all of Safin's advantages, that he can achieve all that he promises 
                  to achieve, or does he believe that his head might still get 
                  in his way?<br>
                  <br>
                  'I think,' he says, 'Marat will become a great, great player. 
                  As long, that is, as he chooses the right people to have around 
                  him.'<br>
                  <br>
                  The latest Mr Right, for Safin at Indian Wells is, of course, 
                  Mats Wilander, and when he talks of his coach it is with the 
                  excitement of a new flirtation, his latest squeeze. The pair 
                  were set up as a blind date by a mutual friend; in the few days 
                  they have been together here they are enjoying first impressions. 
                  'It's not that often that a guy like this comes along,' says 
                  Safin, deadpan, 'so I'm trying to be nice to him: I make sure 
                  I pay all his bills. But I think we have very different characters, 
                  you know, I need what he has, and actually, he needs what I 
                  have.'<br>
                  <br>
                  Wilander, now 36, is still playing the seniors tour and, without 
                  too much sweat, still beating most people ('except McEnroe, 
                  of course'). He has four children and a single-figure golf handicap. 
                  The incentives to go back on the road for 20 weeks a year - 
                  'the minimum you need to do, I guess' - are, you suppose, not 
                  that great. The thing that persuaded him was, he says, seeing 
                  Safin play last year. He had been playing golf in Sun Valley 
                  about four weeks before Flushing Meadow, 'and everyone was asking 
                  me who would win the Open, and I'd been watching Marat, and 
                  I just asked them if they had seen him. No one had of course. 
                  So I said, &quot;You know unless this guy gets injured, there 
                  is no way Sampras is going to win a set off him.&quot; And they 
                  are all like, &quot;Yeah sure Mats.&quot; But it was simple 
                  to see really...'<br>
                  <br>
                  When his prediction came true Wilander was more excited than 
                  ever about Safin's game. 'In the finals he was maybe playing 
                  50 per cent of his ability,' he says, warming to the vicarious 
                  pleasures of the cornerman. 'He didn't get carried away like, 
                  say, Phillipoussis did when he got into the final of a slam, 
                  or Henri Leconte. Safin proved he was on a different level to 
                  that. He proved that mentally he is all there. He has it. It's 
                  just that sometimes he takes his eye off it. But on that occasion 
                  he just said: &quot;Here I am, I'm better than you, and here 
                  it all comes.&quot; And he was playing easy percentage tennis. 
                  Against Sampras. No one has ever done that. . .'<br>
                  <br>
                  In the short time they have been together, Wilander seems to 
                  have formed an easy bond with his charge - he speaks of him 
                  as a favourite son and fellow traveller: another cool European 
                  in a land of college jocks. Attempting to explain why Safin 
                  will win many more grand slams, he explains that he sees the 
                  time the Russian spent in Spain as crucial to his development 
                  (tennis, it seems, lends itself to easy national stereotypes): 
                  'He's much softer, if you know what I mean, than the generic 
                  Eastern European guys,' Wilander argues. 'I mean I love them 
                  all. But, say, with some of the Czech guys it looks like they 
                  have a hard time really giving, getting in there and fighting 
                  really hard.<br>
                  <br>
                  'Not even Ivan Lendl was able to do that until his latter years. 
                  He was in many ways a typical Eastern Bloc athlete: he'd be 
                  there for the money mostly. Yevgeny has a bit of that in him 
                  too [Kafelnikov, who is worth upwards of ?15 million, recently 
                  complained that tennis players were not properly rewarded], 
                  you can see him fight sometimes but sometimes it's just kind 
                  of shallow...' Safin, by contrast, is there purely for the game, 
                  Wilander believes.<br>
                  <br>
                  I wonder if there are elements of his own personality at 21 
                  that he now recognises in the Russian? He leans forward, takes 
                  his sunglasses off, becomes animated. 'He's very curious,' he 
                  says. 'In people, in tennis, in what everyone is doing. You 
                  know he always asks - &quot;Did you go out last night? Where's 
                  a good place to go?&quot; - and you need to have that. Your 
                  brain cannot stop expanding just because you are a tennis professional. 
                  You know, I like the glint in his eye. . . If you have that 
                  you are bound to do better over the course of a career and are 
                  bound also to have more peaks and valleys. <br>
                  <br>
                  'You find that the players who just go along straight,who never 
                  have a bad day, are never ever going to win the big tournaments, 
                  like Medvedev, or Corretja, say. They play just the same at 
                  the slams, and that's never going to be good enough. Marat has 
                  this kind of Tiger Woods mentality, he knows that the moment 
                  itself will fire him....'<br>
                  <br>
                  At Indian Wells, unfortunately, the moment, such as it is, in 
                  a half-empty, sepulchrally quiet stadium is nowhere near enough 
                  to fire Safin, still hampered in his flesh-coloured corset. 
                  Serving at about 40 miles per hour below his normal pace he 
                  succumbs to the hustling Swede Tomas Johansen, pausing only 
                  to hurl his racket at the foot of the umpire's chair in disgust.<br>
                  <br>
                  Afterwards though, he is happy enough. Pleased he came, glad 
                  he tried (and, you suspect, though he does not say as much, 
                  content to have secured the extra money that will be due to 
                  him at the end of the year having played, injured, in this 'mandatory' 
                  tournament). He is still having fun, too, with his new coach 
                  ('I lose,' he says, 'and even then he was happy with me.') He 
                  has, he is sure, plenty to look forward to, knows this is just 
                  a stutter, his ambition is set firmly on next month's French 
                  Open, his favourite tournament. 'I will do everything to win 
                  Roland Garros. Of course I'd like to win all the grand slams, 
                  make people happy, win some money, stay No 1 for five years, 
                  and enjoy my life. But my big aim this year is Roland Garros.' 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The big thing about Safin's game, Wilander says later, is that 
                  he has the ability to win on any surface. Having just failed 
                  to win the grand slam himself - he won everything except Wimbledon 
                  in 1988 - I wonder if one of the incentives for him as a coach 
                  is to achieve what he missed out on as a player? <br>
                  <br>
                  'Perhaps,' he says, but for the moment he is not looking too 
                  far ahead. 'We decided that we would try to make it through 
                  this evening,' he says, laughing. 'I thought that maybe now 
                  he lost he would just kick me out straightaway. But I'm going 
                  to hang in there, wait to see what happens.' As they drive off 
                  together into a sunset over the high sierra, you imagine that, 
                  with Safin, he will not have to wait too long. <br>

                  Formidable groundstokes, but still has something to prove. The

                  her first semi-final on the WTA Tour in Kuala Lumpur last year.

                  Like Kafelnikov, comes from the Black Sea town of Sochi. Turned 
                  pro in 1996 and has gradually climbed the rankings ever since.

                  Very highly rated, hard-hitting Dementieva was the surprise 
                  package of women's tennis last year. Reached the semi-finals

                  After turning pro in 1999, he quickly made an impact on the 
                  men's tour, last year finishing as the second youngest player 
                  - after American Andy Roddick - in the top 200 of the ATP Champions
