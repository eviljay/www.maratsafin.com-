                  <b>Safin expects no more jealousies from Silvia</b><br>
                  <br>
                  The boy, who we see in the court is always filled with anger, 
                  is persisting in his love life. Marat Safin, the 'Russian Love-saint', 
                  told us his 4 years-relationship with his girlfriend Silvia 
                  last night and expects her regards by return.<br>
                  <br>
                  R = The Reporter; S = Safin<br>
                  <br>
                  R: You seem to us that you are always filled with anger in the 
                  court. Why's that?<br>
                  S: It is because I hate to be defeated. I want to win every 
                  match I play, I want to be number 1. Maybe I am really angry 
                  just because I desire to win so much.<br>
                  R: So that's why you broke 48 rackets in a year?<br>
                  S: (aloof) I just don't care. All the rackets are sponsored.<br>
                  R: Do you think you are a rebellious or a revolutionary tennis 
                  player?<br>
                  S: These are what the media term me and I'm not going to think 
                  how I impress people, I just care playing games in the court.<br>
                  R: You are however taking much love care of pets. It is said 
                  that Silvia and you bought a little rabbit in December 1999?<br>
                  S: It's gone.<br>
                  R: Think to buy another one?<br>
                  S: No. Keeping pets is troublesome.<br>
                  R: Can you tell us more about Silvia?<br>
                  S: We have been together for 4 years. She is very good and always 
                  shows much support and care behind me.<br>
                  R: Being a sexy and good-looking man in today's tennis ... oh 
                  no... in the world, you must always be surrounded by many many 
                  girls-fans in the public. Has Silvia ever been jealous of this?<br>
                  S: Tell me what to do then! (a little bit unpleasant) I don't 
                  want to go to those situations neither and she should understand 
                  that these are parts of my job. I hope she can trust me, try 
                  to understand me a little bit more... but both of us know (calm 
                  down), no matter what, we are still loving each other so much 
                  that we will settle many conflicts between us.<br>
                  R: Want to marry her yet?<br>
                  S: Haha... no. I'm still too young, maybe a couple years later.<br>
                  R: Do you still enjoy having your night life?<br>
                  S: Not at all... sometimes.<br>
                  R: What do you drink in the bars?<br>
                  S: I like everything, but I usually drink beer. It feels so 
                  good especially when you drink with a group of friends.<br>
                  R: Want to open your own bar?<br>
                  S: Probably after retired. I have already discussed this with 
                  my friends.<br>
                  R: What will it be called? Your name?<br>
                  S: No. We have decided to call it 'The Balcony'.<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin saw the lions-dancing for the first time at the opening 
                  ceremony of the Salem Open 2001 yesterday. The drums recall 
                  his childhood and Safin reacts with his dance and whistle. Marat 
                  looks kinda happy when wearing the Chinese over-coat given by 
                  the promoter as he said he and Silvia have found nothing size-fitting 
                  during their shopping in Hong Kong.<br>

                  <br>
                  <hr>
                  <br>
                  <b>Beautiful Safin expects a family <br>
                  and desiring good health than fame &amp; wealth</b><br>
                  <br>
                  Picture this: A family-man holding a bottle of beer in one hand 
                  and a baby in another. An tall and handsome Russia tennis player. 
                  In which image will Safin look more attractive to you? It is 
                  not bull. Safin, a giant who is now 21 and 6 feet 4 in height, 
                  seems pretty much enjoy drinking the Qingdao beer (a local beer's 
                  brand name) during his stay in Hong Kong and says it is as good 
                  as the famous beer he drinks in the foreign countries. Safin 
                  says he likes kids so much and will give birth to two at least.<br>
                  <br>
                  S=Safin; R=Reporter<br>
                  <br>
                  R: Everybody agrees you are good looking. Which part do you 
                  think you look the greatest? Do you think the fans like you 
                  due to your appearance?<br>
                  S: I think the fans like me because I play pretty good. I don't 
                  know if I'm good looking, you know, I'm a man and I won't always 
                  look into the mirror (Safin gazes at me [the reporter] and oh, 
                  I am almost electrified), and I don't care much about how I 
                  look by the way.<br>
                  R: How are you going to rank the followings: Family, tennis, 
                  friends, girlfriend, beer.<br>
                  S: (Safin looks at Sylvia who sits quite far apart at once and 
                  then smiles) My girlfriend is here, I can't say she is not number 
                  one. Actually, Family is number one, including my girlfriend, 
                  friends then, tennis, and beer the last.<br>
                  R: Do you drink beer everyday? You don't afraid of having getting 
                  pumped?<br>
                  S: (undoubtedly) Yep, Qingdao beer, I drink it almost everyday, 
                  I like its taste. I am not easy to getting fat.<br>
                  R: Have you got any plans to get married? And how many children 
                  do you want to have?<br>
                  S: I maybe get married at 23, maybe 25, or even 30 or 35, I 
                  can't say when should I get married. I won't get married until 
                  I feel I would like to which means I am ready to give birth 
                  to a kid, to be a father myself. I like children so much that 
                  I think I am going to have at least 2 children. However, it 
                  is not good to have the life I have now (running around the 
                  world to play tennis) when I have children, so I must think 
                  carefully in advance.<br>
                  R: You knew Anna Kournikova when you two are still young. Kournikova 
                  now earns a lot apart from playing tennis. As beautiful as you 
                  are, have you ever thought to follow her footsteps?<br>
                  S: Boys and girls are different. Girls can easily be the people's 
                  focus because of how beautiful they are, and there are not many 
                  beautiful women tennis players after all. But there are many 
                  charming guys in the men's tennis world, look at Rafter, Philippoussis 
                  and Haas. I have earned enough from playing tennis and it is 
                  unnecessary to find other stuff to do apart from this. I don't 
                  feel like doing ads, making films or some kind of self-promotion. 
                  There used to be people asking me to do these things in Moscow 
                  but I declined them. Fans can go to the tennis-courts supporting 
                  me if they want to see me.<br>
                  R: Fame and wealth, which is more important to you?<br>
                  S: Neither compared to good health. I have been injured which 
                  makes me learning that how importance to have good health. Without 
                  a healthy body, how can I earn fame and wealth from tennis?<br>
                  R: Many people say you are the successor of Pete Sampras and 
                  Andre Agassi. Whose successor would you want to be? Pete or 
                  Andre?<br>
                  S: I think &quot;Successor of Sampras&quot; is more applicable 
                  on me since both of us are low-profiled. You can see Agassi 
                  on TV and magazines while Sampras only concentrates on playing 
                  tennis.<br>
