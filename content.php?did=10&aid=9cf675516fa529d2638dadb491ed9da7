<td class="article-body"><P>Marat with his new hairstyle compliments of "hairdresser" Robin Soderling! And he won his first match on grass today for 2006! </P>
<DIV class=headline><STRONG>Interview with Marat Safin</STRONG></DIV>
<P><B class=orange>Tuesday, 13.06.2006</B> from Gerry-Weber official site.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>F: You had kind of a rough start. Then you got things together. What brought the change about?<BR>SAFIN: I was struggling a little bit with the confidence. It’s really difficult to start the matches and play good straight away. I was kind of missing the rhythm. For the past couple of months I had difficulties to find the rhythm back and get the confidence back to be able to win comfortably and play good tennis from the beginning. </P>
<DIV class=text>
<P>F: Is it more difficult on grass than it would be on clay or hard court?<BR>SAFIN: It’s a little bit different, of course. Coming from clay, going to grass, it’s the first match, first round. It’s always difficult because you can practice a lot, but matches are different then practice. So it takes a while to catch up.</P>
<P>F: How are you physically?<BR>SAFIN: Pretty fit. It doesn’t hurt. Everything is okay for the moment.</P>
<P>Q: You have good memories here because you were in the finals. So, I imagine that you want to do the same at least?<BR>SAFIN: I’m too far from thinking of the final. The second match is a pretty difficult one. Rochus can play very well. So, I don’t know what to say. I’m still not in my best shape. But we’ll see how it’s going to go the next match. Maybe Roger will lose to somebody and then it will be a little bit easier. But I’m feeling much more comfortable on grass than the years before at the first tournament.</P>
<P>Q: Coming back to Roger, do you think he is upset by the fact that he couldn’t win in Roland Garros?<BR>SAFIN: Well, I think it’s a little disappointing, being in the finals, having a good chance, playing good tennis over more than two week. He lost the finals in Rome too. I think it’s in his mind. It’s a little difficult to play Nadal because he’s a leftie, he’s younger, he has less pressure than Roger. By the way he’s playing, I think he should beat him. I think it’s more mental than any other problem. But, he’ll win some time. That’s life. I lost some very good finals in my career. It’s very disappointing. But he’ll have more chance. He has no reason to get really down, he won 7 Grand Slams. So, he has nothing to be pissed off about.</P>

<DIV class=headline><STRONG>Safin through to second round </STRONG></DIV>
<P>from Gerry Weber official site</P>
<P><B class=orange>13 June 2006</B>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>It was a typical performance of the Russian, who needed some time to get into the match. Serra earned an early break to make it 3-1 but lost his serve in the crucial seventh game, which helped Safin to get started. "I had some problems with my self-confidence early out," said Safin. "After all, it was the first match on grass of the season." <BR>&nbsp;<BR>Once into swing, Safin looked comfortable and could not be impressed by two wrong calls from the linesman towards to end of the set, twice replying with service winners before closing out the first set in the tie-break. Safin cruised to an early break in the second set and then finished off his opponent after 78 minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Safin has not yet set his sights on a return visit to the finals, where he was beaten by Roger Federer last year. Instead, he vowed to take it step-by-step, with seventh-seeded Belgian Olivier Rochus waiting next. "I have already lost to him this year," Safin stated. Safin claims he is not yet back at his peak, but at least injury-free. (Photo: pmk)<BR></P></DIV></td>
