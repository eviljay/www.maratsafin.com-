                    <b>MODERATOR:</b> Questions for Marat. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> You said if you were scared a minute before you 
                    went out, you wouldn't be able to talk. Do you remember saying 
                    that? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, I didn't talk on the court, I just 
                    played.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Were you scared?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> When I was really scared, it was in the 
                    last game. Actually, last two games. I think I had breakpoint 
                    for the 5-2, 5-1, I don't remember. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Two. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah. So I knew if I would miss this, 
                    I can lose, so I was already start the game with my service 
                    game. I start with a lot of pressure myself. That's why I 
                    make double-fault. I didn't know what to do. I was under pressure. 
                    I couldn't play. I couldn't serve. I serve all the time with 
                    a second serve. I was close to lose it. I don't know what 
                    going to happen if I lose this game. I don't want to think 
                    about this. I was completely -- I was so nervous, I cannot 
                    explain what I felt. "It's now or it's never, never going 
                    to be." <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Why were you not scared before? It's your first 
                    Grand Slam final. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Because I didn't even think about final. 
                    I was trying to beat Pete. Just I knew what I had to do. I 
                    made it try to hold my serve. I think from the baseline I'm 
                    better than him. He has to accept this, that I'm better than 
                    him on the baseline. But in other parts of the game, he's 
                    much better than me. So with my baseline, I can win my service 
                    games easy because I didn't actually had big problems with 
                    this. Also with his serve, I knew I have to risk sometimes. 
                    I have to return his legs and after I have to pass him. It's 
                    simple. I know it's not simple, but it's simple to understand. 
                    Otherwise, you have no chance to beat him. If you start to 
                    make great returns, 200 kilometers per hour, you're not going 
                    to beat him. So it's very simple. We return to his legs and 
                    after we pass him. Very easy.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q</b>. When did you feel you had control of the match today?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Not until we finish, you know, yeah (smiling). 
                    Not before.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Even after being up two sets? <br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: </b>It doesn't matter two sets. It doesn't matter 
                    if it's two sets and I had a match point. Doesn't matter. 
                    We can see against Todd Martin against Moya, two-sets-to-Love, 
                    match point. After what happened? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>You're obviously quite right, this is one of the 
                    greatest moments of your life, fantastic occasion. <br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: </b>How do you know (laughter)?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>How can you relate the feelings now to those you 
                    were feeling, say, going into Monte-Carlo in April?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>I was much better in Monte-Carlo. No, 
                    it's difficult to explain because I just won a tournament, 
                    a huge tournament, but it's a lot of attention, I can see 
                    it, everybody wants to ask me. It's one step forward. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Could you have imagined then? You must have had 
                    some disparaging moments then. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think about quitting the tennis in Indian 
                    Wells. Now I won the US Open. Just I played -- I start to 
                    play better, and before I was thinking to stay in the Top 
                    20. With luck, I can finish in Top 20. Maybe I can go to Top 
                    15. Now I'm thinking about to be for No. 1 in the world. I 
                    have a big chance, so it's a big difference, I think.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Was there one thing that turned that around for 
                    you, a match with somebody, a conversation you might have 
                    had with somebody that turned things around for your year? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think Andrei, he just explain to me, 
                    and I understood this. My ex-coach, he was explaining the 
                    same thing. I'm just start to understand it now. But he was 
                    explaining the same thing like he did Andrei Chesnokov. I 
                    don't know how I understood better Andrei than my ex-coach.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> What was it? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> What was it? "Just fight. When you're 
                    playing bad, you have to fight." I didn't fight. You know 
                    how many matches I lose 6-Love in the second set? I mean, 
                    it was a disaster. I was just making Christmas presents. I 
                    cannot do this. So I start to fight. I was playing -- I didn't 
                    play my best tennis in Barcelona, but I start to fight. I 
                    had a tough match against Zabaleta, a tough match against 
                    Portas. Then my confidence came. I start to play already with 
                    a big serve, inside the court, putting pressure all the time. 
                    I just found it in two days, three days. I don't want to lose 
                    it now. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Do you believe in destiny? Did you see something 
                    written before coming here? You were so convinced in the third 
                    round saying, "I came here not to win the quarters or semifinals, 
                    I came here to reach the final and win."<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I was right. I was right. No, because 
                    if you come here, if you have in your head make quarters, 
                    last 16, semifinal, what is this? It's nothing. Actually, 
                    it's nothing. You have to come to the tournament, to Grand 
                    Slam tournament mentally to win, to win it. Why not? Why I 
                    can't win it? I have everything to be in the final, even beat 
                    Pete. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>But you never said that in the previous tournaments. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Yeah, I start to convince myself, otherwise 
                    I have to think in positive way, not negative. I came here 
                    and said, "I come here to win. If it works, it works." Sometimes 
                    it doesn't work, but at least you have in your head that you 
                    want to win here. So already you have inside to your body 
                    to win, to win each round, you know, just show to the people 
                    that I want to win this tournament. It doesn't matter with 
                    who I'm playing, it doesn't matter in which court. I want 
                    to be in the final. I want to win. That's it. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> How important was it that you had clothes given 
                    to you from Kiefer on your way to this win?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Gives me luck. Gives me luck. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Without his clothes, how would you have done it?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Without his clothes? I would smell on 
                    the court, that's it. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> When you played Pete earlier this year, did you 
                    see any tendencies in his game that you thought you might 
                    be able to exploit? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Before?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>When you played him earlier this year, did you see 
                    any tendencies of his that you thought you could exploit or 
                    work on? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Everybody knows how to play against Pete, 
                    but nobody can beat him. Normally. Earlier in the year, I 
                    would not -- is no chance to beat him. I was playing so bad, 
                    maybe I would win one game in both sets, that's it. But now 
                    with the confidence, you know how to play, you have to receive, 
                    you have to risk sometimes, you have to be sure when you're 
                    going out to the court. But is also difficult to play against 
                    him when you are out of confidence. When you are with confidence, 
                    it's easier. You have to make right decisions in right moments. 
                    If you miss one shot, the set is gone, so you have to be a 
                    hundred percent sure what you are doing on the court. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>You said earlier that you had no confidence until 
                    you had won the match. Does this match change your confidence 
                    level? Do you not think that you can't lose one point for 
                    giving away the match? Will you be different when you come 
                    to play tennis next time?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Explain one more time. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Is your confidence level much higher now, now that 
                    you've won?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Of course, of course. But, you know, the 
                    confidence is coming and is going very fast, very fast. One 
                    week you're playing great tennis, like I did last year, I 
                    played great tennis during two weeks. It was unbelievable 
                    for me. Playing great tennis for two weeks, make two semifinals, 
                    it was huge. After, the confidence gone until the tournament 
                    in Boston. It was like five months, something like this. I 
                    couldn't put one ball inside the court. Now I have the same 
                    situation, I have my confidence back. It's already during 
                    five months. You have to understand this situation, this feeling. 
                    You have to hold it because the game is there. The problem 
                    is in your head, nothing else. You have a head, and you sometimes 
                    use it. You can play great tennis. Otherwise, with only the 
                    shots, there's no chance. Now I have this situation that I'm 
                    playing with a lot of confidence, so tennis is much easier 
                    for me, much more easy. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Pete just made a very strong statement. He said 
                    you could be No. 1 for many, many years. Maybe you don't want 
                    to think about it. What is your response? What are your thoughts 
                    about that comment? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Thank you very much, but I'm still No. 
                    2 or No. 3 I'm going to be. Thanks a lot to respect me, first 
                    of all. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Is this the best match you ever played? Was it the 
                    best return of serve you ever made? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Probably I can say it was best match when 
                    I return. I was returning -- I didn't return better in my 
                    life. But sometimes I was thinking too much from the baseline 
                    because I knew I'm better than him and I can't lose a point 
                    against him, so is not correct. You have to be -- you have 
                    to play your game. I start to push the ball inside the court. 
                    The last game was the same situation. I start to push the 
                    ball. I start to wait for his mistakes. You cannot do this. 
                    You have to play your game. If you start to push the ball, 
                    you can lose your game in five minutes. After you have to 
                    run from one side of the baseline to other side. So I hope 
                    I'll not do the same mistake, otherwise it can cost me the 
                    final. <br>

                    very lonely, did you ever dream about this moment? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Never, never. When I was 14, I was thinking 
                    about how to get my first point in a Satellite. To get a point 
                    in Satellite, you know how difficult is it? It's very difficult. 
                    I was thinking about this. I was playing quallies. I couldn't 
                    pass one round in the qually. To get one point, you have to 
                    pass two or three rounds in the main draw.<br>

                    <br>

                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> I don't have time to think. After when I 
                    go to the locker room, maybe I start to think about this. 
                    Now, it's just nice trophy. I hope I will take it with me. 
                    I can't explain to you right now what I feel. I'm still a 
                    little bit in the match, in the last game. It's very difficult 
                    feeling it was in the last game. I had adrenaline all over 
                    my body. I was so scared, I didn't understand. Now it's difficult 
                    to go out from this situation. I cannot think about how great 
                    is it to win a Grand Slam. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>If you think back to the whole tournament, what 
                    do you think was the toughest match that you had in the tournament? 
                    In the early rounds you struggled. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Three times I struggled, with Guardiola, 
                    Pozzi, Grosjean. I was almost on the plane with Grosjean. 
                    It was 7-6 in the fifth set. I was two sets up. I don't know 
                    what I start to do in the court. In half an hour, I lost two 
                    games. I was already a break down in the fifth set. I felt 
                    like I don't know how to play tennis anymore. I was making 
                    so many mistakes. I was running. I was just running all over 
                    the court. I didn't have any time to think. After, when I 
                    get through this rounds, I just said, "Marat, come on, let's 
                    concentrate, just play your game, make it three sets, and 
                    go home." I start to make it with Ferrero. With Kiefer, it 
                    was a little bit difficult, but I made it. I found my game 
                    after match of Grosjean because I was scared to lose. I just 
                    understood that I can lose here very easy. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Early in the third set, you've already beaten Pete 
                    Sampras, up two sets, early break, were you as shocked as 
                    the crowd was?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>I'm already three years on the Tour, so 
                    I'm used to play with the crowd, you know, with this huge 
                    crowd. I played like in Moscow also against Slovakia in the 
                    Davis Cup. Was the same, but for us. You don't think about 
                    this when you already played for three years on the ATP. You 
                    play your game. You don't think about spectators. It's a little 
                    bit different.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Where did you get that point?<br>

                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> The point you were looking for, the Satellites.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Spain. I was very happy - more than now 
                    (smiling).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Do you remember who you beat and where?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>I beat guys like David Sanchez, he's 90 
                    in the world, Peuntas (ph), he's 100. For me, they were like 
                    400, 300. I had no points at all. When I beat them, it was 
                    unbelievable for me. It was something incredible. I was more 
                    happy than now. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>More money? <br>

                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Despite your nervousness in the match, Pete said 
                    he's not sure you could have played any better. Can you look 
                    at that and just see the fact that you beat a guy who is 13-2 
                    in Grand Slam finals, pretty much blew him away, can you look 
                    at what you did? Are you in awe, as a lot of people who were 
                    there were?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Probably I was less nervous than him because 
                    for him it's very important to win here, in New York with 
                    the crowd. I mean, 20,000 people coming to see you. I just 
                    -- I'm the guy from Russia who had not a lot of spectators 
                    here, so I had nothing to lose, completely nothing. So I just 
                    played my game. I was relaxed. He has a lot of pressure on 
                    him because everybody wants him to win here. I'm just one 
                    guy who came here. I didn't feel any pressure, except the 
                    last game. Then I start to think, "Yes, I can win." Pete, 
                    he become a little bit bigger on the court. He was all over. 
                    You know, he become huge. The racquet is huge. Everything 
                    is huge.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Was it easier than you expected? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Actually, I didn't expect it's going to 
                    be three sets. But I returned very well, definitely. I can't 
                    return better, any better. I can't. I just made it. That's 
                    why it was maybe so easy. Probably he didn't play his best 
                    game also. But it's difficult to explain what happened.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Before the finals, Alexander Volkov said you were 
                    in a hurry to get back to Spain to your girlfriend, Sylvia. 
                    Then after the match, he said you were in a hurry to get back 
                    to Tashkent.<br>

                    start to fight on the court. That's it. Is not so difficult 
                    to play this game. But you have to fight. You have to be there 
                    on the court. If it's five hours, you have to be during five 
                    hours there, running all over the court, point by point, be 
                    there, be tough. After, everything is coming.<br>

                    with myself. I return one serve on the fence. Another return, 
                    I just wanted to make a dropshot. Maybe it wasn't the right 
                    decision, but I wanted to make dropshot. Just went to the 
                    net. The guy just said that it's for tanking. I mean, at least 
                    I'm in history already. <br>

                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Three years ago. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Will you ever say now that your sister will be better 
                    than you? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> My sister?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Yes.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I hope so. At least I have a big future 
                    coaching her. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> How will winning the US Open Championships change 
                    you as a man and how will it change your life? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Explain me one thing: Why you have to 
                    change? Why? Because of this (pointing to trophy)? I just 
                    win a huge tournament. I get this. Yes, I have a check of 
                    $800,000, it's here (pulling it from his pocket, all folded 
                    up). That's it.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Did you sign the check already? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No. I have to get it out. The money in 
                    cash, I will take in cash everything. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>When you went for the dropshot early in the match, 
                    you slipped on the court, did you have any concern about hurting 
                    yourself? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>No, you don't think about this. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> I was worried.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> At least for me the match can finish a 
                    little earlier so I don't have this headache on the court. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Pete said you could be No. 1 for many years if you 
                    wanted to. Are you aware of the sacrifices you need to make? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No, I don't want really (laughter). Of 
                    course, I want. Of course, I want. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> How much you want it, how much you want to be champion.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> There is different levels how much you 
                    want. For me it's one level. I want. I definitely want. I 
                    want. If I have this opportunity, I will do this. If I can 
                    stay for one year, for one week, I will make it. If I have 
                    a chance to make it for seven years, for ten years, I will 
                    make it also. Everybody has opportunity to be in top. But 
                    if you want, you can be there. I want. I personally want.
