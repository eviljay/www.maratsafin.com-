                        Second-ranked Marat Safin, his sore back forcing him to 
                        hit soft serves and making it a struggle just to get around 
                        the court, was upset by Thomas Johansson on Tuesday in 
                        the men's Masters Series tournament. <br>
                        Johansson, sending the U.S. Open champion scrambling side 
                        to side and tossing in an occasional drop shot against 
                        his slowed opponent, won the first-round match 7-5, 7-5.<br>
                        Standing flat-footed rather then arching his back when 
                        he served, Safin hit many of his first serves around 90 
                        mph, more than 48 kph (30 mph) slower than usual. <br>
                        The 21-year-old Russian, afraid to make sudden movements 
                        that might aggravate his back injury, made 33 unforced 
                        errors and hit only 10 winners.<br>

                        On Saturday, at the Dubai Tennis Championships, Juan Carlos 
                        Ferrero scored a 6-2, 3-1 retirement victory over Marat 
                        Safin.<br>
                        Marat Safin's best week of the season ended on a downer. 
                        <br>
                        A back injury suffered on Friday forced the reigning U.S. 
                        Open champion to retire in the second set of Saturday's 
                        final against Spain's Juan Carlos Ferrero at the Dubai 
                        Tennis Championships.<br>
                        Safin hurt his back during his semifinal win over Sweden's 
                        Thomas Johansson on Friday, and said afterwards that he 
                        would not be 100 percent for the final. The injury obviously 
                        affected him as Ferrero raced to a 6-2, 3-1 lead before 
                        Safin decided he was unable to continue.<br>

                        Russia's Marat Safin and Spain's Juan Carlos Ferrero pulled 
                        out three-set wins on Friday to advance to the final at 
                        the $1 million Dubai Tennis Championships.<br>
                        Marat Safin, the reigning U.S. Open champion, overcame 
                        a back injury to rally past unseeded Thomas Johansson 
                        of Sweden, 6-7 (0-7), 7-6 (7-4), 6-3, and move into his 
                        first ATP final of the year.<br>
                        &quot;For the final, I would like to be 100 percent, but 
                        I think it is impossible,'' Safin said. &quot;I have beaten 
                        Ferrero three times quite easily, but he is playing very 
                        well in this tournament and is in very good form.'' <br>
                        Safin hurt the lower left side of his back during the 
                        fifth game of the third set. He was treated on court during 
                        a three-minute injury break. <br>
                        &quot;I hope it will clear up in a few days. ... My back 
                        is not very good and I can not serve fast or make fast 
                        movements,'' Safin said. <br>
                        Safin prevailed in the last set after being taken to two 
                        tiebreakers, losing the first and winning the next. <br>
                        &quot;I was very lucky today as I don't think I had a 
                        good game,'' he said. <br>
                        Johansson's play faltered after the injury break, and 
                        Safin apologized to him afterward for the delay. <br>
                        Saturday's final will match two players who had struggled 
                        in the early part of 2001 before turning things around 
                        this week.<br>
                        The 21-year-old Safin entered this event on a four-match 
                        losing streak, but has dropped only one set in notching 
                        four wins this week.<br>
                        Last year, Safin won an ATP-high seven titles and will 
                        vie for his ninth career singles title Saturday, although 
                        he may not be at 100 percent for the final. He is expected 
                        to hire former tennis great Mats Wilander as his coach 
                        in the near future.<br>

                        On Thursday, at the Dubai Tennis Championships, Russian 
                        No. 1 seed Marat Safin overpowered the Ukraine's Andrei 
                        Medvedev with a 6-1, 6-2 victory, to secure his first 
                        semifinal appearance of the year.<br>

                        of his first title of the year.<br>
                        Said Safin afterward: &quot;I said the first day that 
                        I need a few matches to get into my best shape, and I'm 
                        on my way. I'm playing better and better and I'm ready

                        week, will square off against Sweden's Thomas Johansson, 
                        in a first-time match-up between the players.<br>
                        Topping his early-year quarterfinal finishes at Adelaide 
                        and Auckland, Johansson posted a straight-set 6-4, 6-4

                        Johansson, who has also yet to drop a set this week, knocked

                        Marat Safin, the top-seeded US Open champion, has made 
                        an unconvincing start at the Dubai Open championship. 
                        Safin beat David Prinosil of Germany 7-5 6-2, but had 
                        strong reservations about his own performance. <br>
                        After the match on Tuesday he acknowledged that his lack 
                        of confidence was a problem he did not know how to solve. 
                        <br>
                        &quot;I haven't had good results for a few weeks and I 
                        don't know why - I want to do something to make it better,&quot; 
                        the 21-year-old Russian said. <br>
                        Safin went a break down early on and indulged in several 
                        bouts of head-shaking. Safin announced on Monday that 
                        he has recruited former world number one Mats Wilander 
                        in an effort to improve his game. <br>
                        The Swede will be Safin's fifth coach in a year. <br>
                        &quot;I will talk with Mats and see if we can work something 
                        out,&quot; Safin said. <br>
                        &quot;There are many reasons to choose him - he's a clever 
                        guy and he knows what my game is like, and it can work 
                        between us, I am sure.&quot; <br>
                        But Safin admitted he did not know whether it will actually 
                        work. <br>
                        &quot;The trouble is he has a family and he doesn't need 
                        the money,&quot; he said. <br>
                        &quot;But he does want to be on the tour and to have fun. 
                        <br>
                        &quot;I want a few years more at the top and to try to 
                        make history in my country. <br>
                        &quot;But it really depends on him, because I am the guy 
                        who needs the help.&quot; <br>

                        Top seed Marat Safin was bundled out of the World Indoor 
                        tournament by Belarussian Max Mirnyi on Tuesday. Mirnyi 
                        won their first round match 6-7 6-4 6-3. Safin had the 
                        better of the early exchanges, edging a tight first set 
                        by winning the tie-break. <br>
                        But with the Russian becoming increasingly erratic, a 
                        late break of serve in the second set saw Mirnyi draw 
                        level. Mirnyi, his confidence growing, was by far the 
                        more solid player in the deciding set. Safin said afterwards 
                        his slump in form was only temporary.<br>
                        Safin has struggled to regain his form and his confidence.<br>
                        &quot;I didn't think I played well enough today,&quot; 
                        Safin said. &quot;I had to fight, and I don't have enough 
                        confidence to beat guys like Max right now. I kept trying, 
                        but it didn't work. In the past weeks I've lost a few 
                        matches. It's not a disaster, I just need to win a few 
                        matches. Let's not forget that I lost to Rusedski in Milan 
                        and Hrbaty and Kucera in Davis Cup, so it's not like I'm 
                        losing to players that don't know how to play tennis. 
                        These guys want to beat the No. 1 player and have nothing 
                        to lose. But I'm sure my confidence will come back, it's 
                        just a matter of time.&quot;<br>
                        The demonstrative Safin explained his expressions of anger 
                        on the court as a release of frustration.<br>
                        &quot;Do you expect me to smile like an idiot on court?&quot; 
                        Safin said. &quot;Nobody likes to lose, and I can't be 
                        relaxed when I see on the scoreboard that I'm losing and 
                        making stupid mistakes. That's just the way I am.&quot;<br>
                        The U.S. Open champion is continuing his search for a 
                        coach who's able to travel with him full time.<br>
                        &quot;I'm trying to find someone who has been a top 10 
                        player and who knows what it takes,&quot; Safin said. 
                        &quot;But itнs difficult to find someone that wants to 
                        travel.&quot; <br>

                        Yevgeny Kafelnikov made an extraordinary recovery to give

                        round of the Davis Cup by NEC in Bratislava. The 27-year-old

                        Karol Kucera 4-6 4-6 6-3 6-2 6-2 in the fifth and deciding

                        Republic might achieve a fairytale comeback when Kucera 
                        took the opening two sets against his higher rated opponent. 
                        However Kafelnikov raised his game from 3-3 in the third

                        Russia may be heavy favourites over Slovakia in their 
                        World Group Davis Cup first round tie this weekend, but 
                        don't tell that to Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Marat Safin. 
                        Russia's top two players must overcome in-form Dominik 
                        Hrbaty, who thrashed Safin in straight sets at the quarter-finals 
                        of the Australian Open and is 8-0 against former world 
                        number one Kafelnikov on the ATP tour.<br>
                        Russia's Davis Cup captain Shamil Tarpishchev said:&quot;Theirs 
                        is probably the worst combination for us. Kafelnikov has 
                        an 0-8 record against Hrbaty in ATP tournaments and has 
                        only one career win against him, which came in the Davis 
                        Cup. &quot;Safin is 4-4 against Hrbaty, but lost his last 
                        match to him.<br>
                        Since Russia's 1999 triumph over the Slovaks, Safin has 
                        shone, winning the U.S. Open and rising to the number 
                        one position before closing out 2000 second in the rankings. 
                        But his Davis Cup performances have been somewhat lacklustre.<br>
                        After besting Hrbaty and Kucera, he lost both of his singles 
                        matches in Russia's semifinal tie against Australia in 
                        September 1999 and then again against Spain last April.<br>
                        Kafelnikov has fared no better, also losing all four Davis 
                        Cup matches against Spain and Australia, but he said that 
                        his record against Hrbaty on the ATP tour would not stand 
                        in the way of a Russian victory. <br>

                        On Friday at the Milan Indoors, unseeded Greg Rusedski

                        his first semifinal appearance of the new year. <br>
                        Attacking the net aggressively, Rusedski overpowered the 
                        New Balls Please campaign star, never allowing Safin to 
                        establish any rhythm in the first set.<br>
                        Said Safin afterward: In the first part of the match I 
                        had no chance. I did what I could but I couldn't do anything 
                        in thesecond to change it. I can't be on top when playing 
                        like I did today.&quot; <br>

                        Rusedski continued to frustrate the Russian, mixing up 
                        his serve and volley game with strong powerful ground

                        On Thursday afternoon in Milan, Marat Safin, Greg Rusedski 
                        and Julien Boutter advanced to the quarterfinals. <br>
                        Surviving a first-set scare by Xavier Malisse on Thursday 
                        at the Milan Indoors, No. 1 seed Marat Safin rallied past 
                        the Belgian qualifier 3-6, 6-3, 7-5. After a commanding 
                        first-set assault by Malisse, the Russian New Balls Please 
                        campaign star broke the Belgian early in the second set 
                        en route to leveling the match.<br>
                        &quot;It was a tough match. I had some problems to close 
                        it out. I am satisfied, but the level of my play in the 
                        first set was not good,&quot; said Safin afterward.<br>
                        Though Malisse continued to play tough, Safin scored a 
                        decisive break of the Belgian at 5-5 in the decider, and 
                        then held his final serve to secure the win.<br>
                        In the quarterfinals, Safin will face Britain's Greg Rusedski, 
                        who advanced over defending champion Marc Rosset, as the 
                        Swiss No. 8 seed retired from their match at 6-3, 1-0. 
                        <br>
                        Though Safin owns a 2-1 edge over Rusedski, the Russian 
                        has a score to settle with the Briton. Last November, 
                        Rusedski derailed Safin's Tennnis Masters Series Stuttgart 
                        campaign in the third round. Said Safin of the prospect 
                        of facing the Briton: "It's difficult to return his first 
                        serve, so it's going to be tough."<br>

                        in the second set and rallied to win the final three games

                        Russia have named Marat Safin and Yevgeny Kafelnikov in 
                        their squad for next week's Davis Cup world group first 
                        round tie against Slovakia. <br>
                        Both players ended last year in the top five but the Russians 
                        are wary of playing Dominik Hrbaty and Karol Kucera in 
                        front of their home fans in Bratislava. <br>
                        &quot;I expect a very tough match, especially playing 
                        against Hrbaty and Kucera in their back yard,&quot; Russia's 
                        Davis Cup captain Shamil Tarpishchev told Reuters on Monday. 
                        <br>
                        &quot;Theirs is probably the worst combination for us. 
                        Kafelnikov has an 0-8 record against Hrbaty in ATP tournaments 
                        and has only one career win against him, which came in 
                        the Davis Cup. <br>
                        &quot;Safin is 4-4 against Hrbaty, but lost his last match 
                        to him.&quot;<br>
                        A week ago Hrbaty crushed the U.S. Open champion, who 
                        finished last year ranked number two in the world, in 
                        straight sets in the fourth round at the Australian Open. 
                        <br>
                        Tarpishchev said the outcome of next week's tie would 
                        greatly depend on how quickly Safin and Kafelnikov recovered 
                        from their grueling start to the year. <br>
                        &quot;Actually it turned out better for us that both of 
                        them didn't stay in Melbourne very long, losing their 
                        matches way before the final,&quot; he said. <br>
                        &quot;But this week they're playing again in Milan and 
                        I'm worried whether they'll be fresh enough next week.&quot; 
                        <br>
                        In the only other Davis Cup tie between the two countries, 
                        Safin edged Hrbaty to give Russia a 3-2 quarterfinal victory 
                        in July 1999. <br>
                        Hrbaty's younger brother was attacked in the stands of 
                        Moscow's Olympic Sports Complex by Russian fans during 
                        his opening day match against Kafelnikov. <br>
                        Tarpishchev named three newcomers, Mikhail Yuzhny, Andrei 
                        Stolyarov and Denis Golovanov, to the Russian team -- 
                        but none of them are likely to see any action. <br>
                        The Russian captain said he was confident his team would 
                        win the Davis Cup in the next few years. <br>
                        &quot;Having two players like Marat and Yevgeny on the 
                        team we just have to win it sooner or later,&quot; he 
                        said. &quot;We have been unlucky not to win it in the 
                        last few years and it is just a matter of time before 
                        everything comes together for us.&quot; <br>
                        &quot;It has hurt us in the past that we only had two 
                        top players ... but I'm optimistic this is about to change. 
                        We will win both the Davis and the Federation Cups,&quot; 
                        said Tarpishchev, who also heads Russia's Federation Cup 
                        team. <br>
                        &quot;And speaking of the women, in three to four years 
                        our team will simply be the best, second to none, take 
                        my word for it.&quot; <br>

                        Marat Safin is out of the Australian Open in Melbourne. 
                        Slovakian Dominik Hrbaty defeated second seed Safin in 
                        straight sets 6-2 7-6 6-4.<br>
                        The unpredictable Safin had a bad day, time and again 
                        misfiring or allowing Hrbaty to pounce on short offerings 
                        and put them away for winners to all corners of the court. 
                        <br>
                        Safin had his chances, grabbing early breaks in the first 
                        and second sets, but he held his serve just once in the 
                        first setHe put up a better fight in the second set, fending 
                        off two set points on his serve at 5-6, and another three 
                        during the tiebreak, but eventually paid the price for 
                        a few too many loose forehands into the net. <br>
                        His confidence sapped at two sets down, Safin felt like 
                        there was nothing he could do to turn the match because 
                        he was unable to move Hrbaty around. &quot;I was afraid 
                        to hit the ball.<br>
                        I was afraid to change the directions,&quot; said Safin. 
                        Hrbaty needed only one more service break in the third 
                        set to sew up the match as Safin hammered a backhand into 
                        the net on the final point. &quot;I didn't make anything, 
                        absolutely nothing, to beat him today,&quot; Safin said. 
                        <br>
                        &quot;Actually, I didn't play today,&quot; Safin said. 
                        &quot;It was something wrong with me because I couldn't 
                        move and just made too many mistakes. I cannot play this 
                        way, being No. 1, No. 2 in the world. This is not my tennis. 
                        It was a bit of a disaster.&quot; <br>

                        Marat Safin appears eager to redeem himself for an embarrassing 
                        effort at last year's Australian Open, and eager to contend 
                        for a No. 1 ranking he came so close to claiming last 
                        year. <br>
                        One year after getting fined for tanking a first-round 
                        loss here, the reigning U.S. Open champion from Russia 
                        began his bid for a second straight Grand Slam title with 
                        a gutsy 6-4, 1-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5) first-round win over 
                        Spain's Galo Blanco.<br>
                        Nursing a sore right elbow, Safin managed to fire 11 aces 
                        but committed 59 unforced errors and lost his serve three 
                        times in the nearly three-hour battle. He prevented any 
                        further damage to the elbow by eking out the fourth-set 
                        tiebreaker.<br>
                        &quot;The elbow is injured. For the moment it is OK,&quot; 
                        Safin said. &quot;I can serve and I'm really satisfied. 
                        I hope I will serve like this during the two weeks.&quot;<br>
                        Seeded second, Safin rebounded from his humiliating effort 
                        in Melbourne last year to win an ATP-high seven titles 
                        and come within a match of becoming the youngest season-ending 
                        No. 1 player.<br>
                        &quot;It's like in every sport, you want to be the best,&quot; 
                        Safin said. &quot;I wanted to be the best, but I made 
                        some stupid mistakes at the Masters (Cup) and that's why 
                        I'm No. 2. This year I hope that I will be more clever 
                        and I'm going to make all things the right way. I'm still 
                        fighting for No. 1 and I hope to for a few more years.&quot;<br>

                        U.S. Open champion Marat Safin, slowed by a sore elbow, 
                        was beaten in the first round of an Australian Open tuneup 
                        Wednesday.<br>
                        ''I'm afraid of making it worse. I don't want to be out 
                        six months,'' Safin said after his 6-2, 6-1 loss to France's 
                        Nicolas Escude in the Colonial Classic. <br>
                        In other matches, Spanish Davis Cup hero Juan Carlos Ferrero 
                        beat Pete Sampras 6-2, 6-4, and Olympic gold medalist 
                        Yevgeny Kafelnikov defeated two-time U.S. Open champion 
                        Patrick Rafter 6-2, 6-2.<br>
                        Safin planned to see a doctor later Wednesday, and decide 
                        then whether to continue in the eight-man exhibition tournament. 
                        <br>
                        ''If the doctor says I can play, I will play,'' he added. 
                        ''You have to be careful. Simple things can change your 
                        life.'' He said six months would be the recuperation period 
                        if surgery were needed. <br>
                        The Australian Open, the year's first Grand Slam tournament, 
                        starts next Monday. Safin, who climbed to No. 2 in the 
                        rankings after a dismal start in 2000, was fined for not 
                        trying at last year's Australian. He has said he wants 
                        to show his true abilities this time. Safin said a similar 
                        elbow problem kept him out of action for more than a month 
                        18 months ago.<br>
                        The problem started flaring up again last week, he said. 
                        Safin said the soreness apparently indicated he was doing 
                        something wrong in his strokes, and would have to fix 
                        it. He also said he did not have a coach with him here. 
                        The 20-year-old Russian made frequent groundstroke errors, 
                        and occasionally bounced his racket off the court in frustration. 
                        <br>
                        ''It's difficult to play when you start to think about 
                        being sore,'' he said. <br>
