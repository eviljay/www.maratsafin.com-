                    Marat Safin - Rainer Schuettler 3-6, 6-3, 6-3.<br>
                    interview after the match against Schuettler</b><br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>- Your comments about final?</b><br>
                    - It was tough. I’ve played 6 sets yesterday and all weren’t 
                    easy. Spent about 12 hours on the court. Some more, my knee 
                    hurts after I hit myself with the racket during practice. 
                    So I was feeling terrible.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>- Major of SPB made a mistake during his speech and called 
                    you Rinat instead of Marat. Did you want to react some way?</b><br>
                    - Nothing serious. Anybody can make a mistake. I’ve used to 
                    it.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>- YK after winning 4 times Kreml. Cup has mentioned he 
                    may consider buying out the tournament. How many times you 
                    have to win here to come out with the same idea?</b><br>
                    - Are you trying to ask me how much money I have to make for 
                    that? I think even if you are investing a huge amount of money 
                    into business venture it doesn’t mean you are going to have 
                    nice feeling about it. It all depends on love from spectators, 
                    not on the finances.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>- Last year you had A.Volkov on the stand to support you 
                    here. This year he isn’t among spectators. Did you feel any 
                    support from him?</b><br>
                    - I have a very close relationship with Alexander. I have 
                    no secrets from him. It’s OK he isn’t here today. I still 
                    consider him as a best friend.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>- You have made so many mistakes in the 1st set. Is it 
                    related to your tough matches during past few days?</b><br>
                    - As I said earlier, I’ve spent too much time on the court. 
                    Slept 8 hours. Felt pain in my knee, couldn’t move well. But 
                    I’ve managed to pull myself together and win a couple of opponent’s 
                    service games. That’s why I won.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>- Any comments on line judges tonight?</b><br>
                    - It’s true, there was a couple of disputable calls. It’s 
                    pity, when you are playing and home and your serve is in (clearly 
                    for everybody) but it is called out. Every point is very important 
                    and it’s not nice such a bad mistakes can happen.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    - Last year you were irritated by spectator’s ringing mobile 
                    phones. Any comments on spectators “behavior” this year?</b><br>
                    - It is looks like people made more money and now they have 
                    phones with vibration mode. It is nice to see that Russians 
                    are doing well and prosper. (Laugh in audience).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>- Did you manage to see anything else in SPB besides courts 
                    and hotel?</b><br>
                    - Unfortunately, no.<br>
                    <br>
                    - Any prediction on your performance in Paris and chances 
                    to go to Sydney?<br>
                    - I don’t have a good chance for Sydney. But all can change 
                    if I win in Paris. But it will depend not only on my physical 
                    condition but how others going to play there. For instance, 
                    Tim Henman. It’s OK if Paris going to be my last tournament 
                    of the year. I’m very glad I’ve won two titles this season. 
                    But of course, I will try to perform better in future.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    - Did you ever get so much prizes and presents after wining 
                    a tournament? What are you going to do with it?</b><br>
                    - I have no idea, but I think it’s going to be a nice trouble.<br>

                    Marat Safin - Yevgeny Kafelnikov 6-7(4), 6-2, 6-4.<br>
                    interview after the match against Kefelnikov</b><br>
                    <br>
                    <b><br>
                    - Tonight both of you were disagree with line calls very often. 
                    What’s happened?</b><br>
                    - Not only players but also judges were nervous as well. They 
                    have made mistakes a couple of times. It is normal. If you 
                    think you are right you should tell this to empire. He needs 
                    to keep concentration too. It vas a very close match and 2-3 
                    points could decide a winner. So price for mistakes was very 
                    high.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>- How YK has surprised you tonight?</b><br>
                    - He concentrates well and has started great. He is in great 
                    form now and it is difficult to play against him. He is playing 
                    too fast and it is causing problems for his opponents.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>- It was a very close match, in second and third sets score 
                    was 40:40 very often on your serve. How did you win? Is it 
                    concentration, determination or luck?</b><br>
                    - I think I didn’t serve well. It was difficult to play without 
                    good serve against such a strong opponent as YK (some more 
                    he has a great return). I was lucky sometimes.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>- You had a few foot faults, which is seldom happened to 
                    you. Any comments?</b><br>
                    - For the past 3 month I had no foot fault at all. Normally 
                    if foot fault in mm or cm it won’t help you much and judges 
                    usually don’t call it. So I was surprised with so many such 
                    calls tonight. I think two or three times I even didn’t cross 
                    the line. Some more I’ve been serving badly, everybody saw 
                    it.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>- Can you say that after two win in a row against YK you 
                    will have psychological advantage against him in future?</b><br>
                    - YK is very strong. I always know he is going to give 100% 
                    on the court. He is concentrating great and serving good. 
                    His serve not his strongest weapon but today everything was 
                    in place for him. Everything was decided by one point. He 
                    could win tonight. Very tough match to get any psychological 
                    advantage.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    - Both of you wanted to play great tennis, winning was second 
                    priority. So, no goal to win by any cost?</b><br>
                    - It was our first match in Russia. Before we played couple 
                    of years ago in Rome and this year in Tashkent. We wanted 
                    to give a good performance for spectators. We both played 
                    well and deserve applauses. If anyone win too easily it wouldn’t 
                    be so interesting. Tonight we both have given our best.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>- Did you book candlelight dinner wit YK? After such performance 
                    you deserve it.</b><br>
                    - Thanks. I think everybody happy. Good match. I’m proud of 
                    YK and myself. We have played for spectators only.<br>

                    interview after the match against Martin</b><br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>- Martin has a lot of patience and stays back a lot. It 
                    looks like it this type of game you have made more mistake 
                    than he. What’s the reason?</b><br>
                    - It’s difficult to play with type of balls, which have been 
                    chosen for SPBO. You can call its “dead”. Not suitable for 
                    slice shots at all. But I’ve found match very useful. I’ve 
                    been trying to gain confidence and even in wasn’t easy, I 
                    think I’ve found my game, especially before Paris.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>- A lot of questions if you can make it to Sydney. Is it 
                    so important for you?</b><br>
                    - Not so much. To go there I need to win or at least to be 
                    in the SF here and win in Paris. With kind of tennis I play 
                    now it is difficult to get to Sydney. But since I’m gaining 
                    confidence and if play well in Paris – who knows? There is 
                    a chance but I’m not too concern about it. For me important 
                    thing is to be in the top 5 and not lower. The rest is not 
                    for me. So my priority is to gain necessary confidence and 
                    try to be number 1 at the end of 2002.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>- What about spectators? Looks like some of them were against 
                    you tonight.</b><br>
                    - I didn’t notice anything like this. Opposite, I’m very happy 
                    with crowd’s support. They have seen my mistake, knew I’m 
                    not playing my best, but still supported me. I’m grateful 
                    they understand tennis so well.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>- Your participation in Kreml. Cup – did it gain more supporters 
                    for you?</b><br>
                    - I don’t want to talk about it anymore, but OK, I will answer 
                    last time. It’s impossible always to win and display great 
                    tennis. I’m not robot – just human being. When you are not 
                    on top of your game, you expect support not scolding. I had 
                    match point against Hrbaty, I’ve been fighting to the end, 
                    played for spectators. And when they blame you – it is not 
                    nice, ridiculous, and stupid.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>- Seems it is spectators fault, for instance, they didn’t 
                    turn up for latest “Spartak” game in Champions League. So, 
                    no matter what, they have to give their full support?</b><br>
                    - No, they have to throw chairs… “Spartak” are not playing 
                    well at this moment but guys were trying. They were among 
                    top 8 in Europe last season. I’ve been living in Spain for 
                    a few years and when “Real” Madrid has been hanging around 
                    10th place, stadium always was 100% full.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    - Your next opponent is GI. What is your opinion?</b><br>
                    - I’ve played against him once at Wimbledon, lost in 4 tight 
                    sets. It is difficult to play against him on the fast surface 
                    – he has a great serve. I will try my best; I think 2-3 points 
                    will decide it. Hope I will be able to return well and a lot 
                    will depend on luck.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    - You supposed to pay to Mats for every broken racket. Today 
                    you have been doing it often.</b><br>
                    - I didn’t keep my promise, I break rackets often, and it 
                    is ridicules if I pay every time. It is twice more upsetting 
                    since I have to spend money to buy a new one.<br>
