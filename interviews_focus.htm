                    Interview for the German magazine &quot;Focus&quot;,October 
                    2000.<br>
                    translated by Julia<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Russian Marat Safin, shooting-star in the tennis-circuit, 
                    give us his (successfully) secrets away.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Focus:</b> You was the first Russian who had won the US 
                    Open and on the occasion beat the American long-running winner 
                    Pete Sampras in three straight sets. Have you allowed yourself 
                    some luxury goods from the $800 000 bonus afterwards?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Safin:</b> First of all I paid 30% taxes and then my coach 
                    and manager. And when you subtract the travel expenses, maybe 
                    $200 000 dollars were left. That's still a lot of money, I 
                    know…<br>
                    All right, I had bought a 600er Mercedes which is now custom-built 
                    in Stuttgart. That was my dream, life is short and I'm only 
                    one time 20 years old.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Focus: </b>After your rapid ascent, you moved from Moscow 
                    to the tax haven Monte Carlo. Have you as a man coming from 
                    a country with big economical problems, especially desire 
                    for luxury?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Safin:</b> When I look at a dollar note, I only see a picture 
                    of George Washington on a piece of paper. Money is only money. 
                    It makes the life easier, but I don't feel sexy or mighty 
                    because of that.<br>
                    Two years ago, when I didn't had a cent in the pocket, it 
                    was a little bit different. At that time I often thought, 
                    how nice it would be, to have heaps of money. Particularly 
                    when I moved as 14 year old boy to Spain. There had to managed 
                    with $15 in a week from my sponsors for three years. $15 were 
                    enough for the bus tickets to the training - there was no 
                    think of a cinema visit…<br>
                    Now the mechanism is similar at me as at the others who work 
                    successfully: Had you made $200 000, you aimed the $400 000 
                    mark - and then the million…<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Focus:</b> Tennis is certainly not a folk sport in Russia. 
                    There are barely courts - but still over and over again top-class 
                    players. How can someone become in your homecountry a tennis 
                    pro?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Safin:</b> I began as a six-year-old with football at Spartak 
                    Moscow. I wasn't interested in tennis, but didn't knew what 
                    to do with my feets, too.<br>
                    In that way my mother said, that tennis will be better for 
                    me. She was a tennis trainer. Then I tried it. We had 13 courts 
                    and the better I got, the more I liked it.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Focus:</b> Your meteoric rise astonished the experts also 
                    that's why because you can only hardly control your emotions 
                    on the court. As a token of weakness was interpreted that 
                    you break narrowly 50 rackets in a season because of fury.<br>
                    Are you at least happy that the ATP-Tour will now display 
                    the rules concerning to manners more easy-going to improve 
                    the entertainment value?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Safin:</b> You bet, occasionally angry outbursts belongs 
                    to me. After all I'm not a robot, from time to time I have 
                    to work off.<br>
                    And the ATP properly recognized, that interesting blokes are 
                    good for the circuit, so letus be, as we are. However I couldn't 
                    hardly change myself even with severely rules. Angry outbursts 
                    are part of my character. I have to let out of my body the 
                    negative energy. Otherwise it builds up and sometime I get 
                    ill.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Focus: </b>How popular are you in your Russian home and 
                    somewhere else?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Safin:</b> After I had won the US Open, my recognizing 
                    value climb up.<br>
                    Unfortunately the funny things don't happened to me now - 
                    such as last new-year's-eve in Moscow. I wanted to go to a 
                    famous club and they didn't let me in. I liked it. When today 
                    somebody don't recognize me and ask me what I do professionally, 
                    I always answer that I'm a poor student. That's more interesting 
                    and funnier.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Focus:</b> With such little diversions you can't be now 
                    successfully as a hero of the Russian sport in your home…<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Safin:</b> Right, the club had actually sent me a VIP-Pass 
                    and I received a greetings telegram from our president Vladimir 
                    Putin after my victory in New York. Sure, that were big news, 
                    the first Russian who had won in New York…<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Focus:</b> Who had you met as a result of your Grand-Slam-win?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Safin:</b> Kevin Costner. I only knew him from movies. 
                    I asked him for an autograph, he didn't knew me. Bill Clinton 
                    I also met during the US Open. It was very pleasant. I felt 
                    like a little child in the presence of him, I said that I 
                    play tennis and if he can give me an autograph. A friendly 
                    man. It must be hard to be so famous.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Focus:</b> You only think about tennis on the court?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    Safin:</b> Oh no, you think about dinner, your car, playing 
                    golf and sometimes I thought about sex… But these thoughts 
                    don't have to get out of control, otherwise the point, the 
                    set or the match got lost very fast.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Focus:</b> Apart from mental aid programs - are there dopings 
                    in the tennis-circuit?<br>
                    </font></p>
                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Safin:</b> 
                    No, on no account. In my early years I was suspicious, too. 
                    I couldn't believe how the top-players can play over three, 
                    four hours on the highest level.<br>
                    Today I know that only tough trainings can make that possible. 
                    I had won the US Open and even didn't took my vitamins. Since 
                    6 months they were lying in my suitcase. I drank tap water 
                    on the court. That was my doping.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    Focus:</b> The ATP-Tour invest many millions in their new 
                    publicity campaign &quot;New Balls Please&quot; and you're 
                    an important face of this PR-Tour. Nethertheless it seems 
                    that the women tennis would rob the men at the moment the 
                    show. Would you agree with the former stars Becker and McEnroe 
                    that the men tennis is lodged in a crisis?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Safin:</b> Crisis is too far-reaching. There is only a 
                    small problem with the changing of the guard: The public don't 
                    know the new boys enough, but only the old troopers Sampras 
                    and Agassi.<br>
                    In women tennis are at the moment a lot of nice girls. The 
                    spectators want to see it. With it I have to break a lance: 
                    We, men, have many good-looking boys. The women have to look 
                    exactlier at Enqvist, Rafter, Haas or Philippoussis…<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Focus:</b> Your countrywoman Anna Kournikova haven't won 
                    a tournament, but get so much publicity as no one other. Is 
                    show and image more important than substance?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    Safin:</b> Perhaps are performances and results not so important 
                    on the women tour to cause a star cult. Of course, Anna belongs 
                    to the best players in the world, she was also in dozens of 
                    finals. But her fame stir rather because of she looks good 
                    and that she exploit herself shiny.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Focus:</b> What do you think, how would end a match between 
                    Anna Kournikova and Nicolas Kiefer?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Safin:</b> 6:0, 6:0 - of course for Kiefer. Anna wouldn't 
                    win a point, unless, Kiefer would think: Goodness, she looks 
                    pretty - and because of that lose his concentration.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Focus:</b> The US Open winner Serena Williams was seriously 
                    thinking about that she can take part with the men…<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Safin: </b>She would lose against our N° 1000. No chances.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Focus:</b> What would you chang as the chef of the ATP-Tour?<br>
                    Abolish the second serve?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Safin:</b> And the next time we have to play on the beach 
                    with a 2 meters high net? Tennis exists for now 100 years 
                    in this type and no one hadn't object something. Now the surfaces 
                    are too fast, the rackets too pressurely, the balls too light 
                    and too small. That's nonsense.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Focus:</b> What do you expect from your new manager Ion 
                    Tiriac?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Safin:</b> Ion Tiriac is Mister Tennis and I admired him 
                    when I was a small boy how he ran through the tennis-circuit 
                    with his giant moustache. I hope that he can show me the way 
                    . He had formed Becker and Ivanisevic and nobody hadn't complained 
                    about him. I didn't wanted to be a small fish in a big firm, 
                    but to have somebody who have time for me, too.<br>
