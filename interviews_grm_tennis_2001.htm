                    Tennis magazine, April 2001<br>
                    Interview with Marat Safin <br>
                    translated by Julia<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Year 2000 was for Marat Safin the year of his discovery. 
                    The year 2001 is the year of demonstration of his worth. In 
                    tennis magazine the US Open champion speaks about his example 
                    Pete Sampras and his ideal trainer Mats Wilander.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>tennis magazine: </b>Mister Safin, Pete Sampras had described 
                    you as the future of tennis. How do you live with this compliment?<br>
                    <b>Marat Safin:</b> Sounds good. A fat lot uf use that is.I 
                    have to see, that I can bring my results on the court.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>tennis magazine</b>: Do you have the feeling, that you 
                    are able to achieve the class of Sampras or Andre Agassi?<br>
                    <b>Marat Safin:</b> I am pretty self-confident, but I do not 
                    think, that someone from our generation would achieve, what 
                    both of them had achieved. Pete and Andre are gods, against 
                    them we, the young players, did not have achieve anything.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>tennis magazine:</b> Why is it today harder, to stay for 
                    a longer time at the top of tennis?<br>
                    <b>Marat Safin:</b> Agassi and Sampras are the last one, who 
                    dominated a whole era. Goodness, Sampras was for seven years 
                    the number one, this won't never again achieve anybody. Everything 
                    is so hurried. You can fall from the top and do not have to 
                    have even a crisis. These days the top one hundred player 
                    are able to beat each other at all time. There are no hierarchy 
                    anymore. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>tennis magazine:</b> But why Sampras and Agassi still win 
                    the big tournaments?<br>
                    <b>Marat Safin:</b> They could acquire their ruthless and 
                    class at the big tournaments in an another time. Ten, actually 
                    five years ago there was a low in tennis, today vast numbers 
                    of top players, always ready to for a sensation. When you 
                    get through never farther than to the third, fourth or fifth 
                    round at the Garnd Slams, you are a good player, a very good 
                    player, but not a record man like Sampras.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>tennis magazine:</b> Does the insight weaken you, that 
                    tennis is so unpredictable and the challenge all the time 
                    get greater? <br>
                    <b>Marat Safin:</b> I have the feeling, to learn the newest 
                    thing each day and each hour. What I can buy today on my laurels 
                    from the US Open winning?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>tennis magazine:</b> You have a better position at the 
                    sponsor poker. You just change your racket outfitter from 
                    Head to Dunlop. This you had gild for your own, certainly.<br>
                    <b>Marat Safin: </b>Maybe. But sportily such a nice victory 
                    fade very fast. Particularly, because the nice colleagues 
                    look now exactly at that Safin. You were checked thoroughly. 
                    The surprise factor is gone.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>tennis magazine:</b> You knock down the pressure with sturdy 
                    racket smashes. You are the record holder in questions of 
                    racket consumption.<br>
                    <b>Marat Safin:</b> I am not a type, who weave a game through 
                    like a paragon - quiet and soft. Shouting, roar and curse 
                    - it belongs to me. Today and in future. When I could not 
                    take out my fury and were not allowed to break a racket, I 
                    would get totally tense. And my nervousness higher.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>tennis magazine:</b> But at the beginning of 2000 when 
                    you almost wanted to stop with tennis, you broke the rackets 
                    by the dozen. At that time that had not got a therapeutic 
                    effect.<br>
                    <b>Marat Safin:</b> No, for heaven's sake. I feel at that 
                    time like a boiler, which stood Constantly for an explosion. 
                    That was unhealthly. I mean only: No one can expect, that 
                    we drone our game like roboters. People regret, that the types 
                    in tennis die out. Than they have to accept oppositely, that 
                    people like me do something crazy.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>tennis magazine: </b>Do you see yourself more as a tennis 
                    pro or as an entertainer in a modern sport-show?<br>
                    <b>Marat Safin:</b> The people like me, because I am not like 
                    many others. I leave my heart out on the court, my emotions. 
                    Did I do it for business reasons? No: I behave just like me. 
                    I do not have to feign. I bid a good show, but I am not a 
                    showman.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>tennis magazine: </b>After your US Open victory you exchanged 
                    your sportily escort, intensely. The last time actually an 
                    alliance with the former swedish number one, Mats Wilander, 
                    was under discussion.<br>
                    <b>Marat Safin:</b> In general it is not so easy, to find 
                    good people, who can travel with you. Mats would be top-class 
                    partner, no doubt. But is he ready to work with me on a day-to-day-base? 
                    That we want to solve fast.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>tennis magazine:</b> How did you get in touch with him?<br>
                    <b>Marat Safin:</b> That mediated a mutual friend. I was with 
                    him in the middle of december in St. Polten, he spoke to me 
                    over a glass of beer in a skibar: you, Mats is interested, 
                    to work with you. But I was at first reserved, I needed time 
                    to think over.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>tennis magazine: </b>What are there to think over?<br>
                    <b>Marat Safin:</b> That had asked me my friend too. He meant: 
                    Such one like Mats you do not get every day. A little later 
                    I said to my myself: dammed, you are alone, you do not have 
                    at the time a real coach - you have to make use.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>tennis magazine:</b> What do you want, what do you have 
                    to improve with your trainer?<br>
                    <b>Marat Safin:</b> Certainly my mental strength. 80% of the 
                    games were won in the head, athletic are all equal good, today. 
                    I think, you have to radiate a positive arrogance on the court, 
                    an attitude mediating class. Like Sampras. At Sampras you 
                    do not have the feeling, that he is deceptive condescendingly.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>tennis magazine: </b>Is it possible to learn these strengths? 
                    <b><br>
                    Marat Safin:</b> Until a certain grade: yes. A lot is a question 
                    of time. You learn at the rise with each match in the tennis 
                    circuit. Sometime you get a better understanding , what to 
                    do in a match.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>tennis magazine:</b> When Pete Sampras ward off a matchball 
                    with an ace, when top-players like Agassi conjures at the 
                    Bip Points his best shots, is this the result of this apprenticeship 
                    in the tennis life?<br>
                    <b>Marat Safin:</b> Of course is this callous, which had Becker, 
                    which Sampras have, an innate quality, too. There are sensational 
                    players, who had their problems during tricky match situations: 
                    They do not get on the top. Nevertheless I say: You can learn 
                    to win.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>tennis magazine:</b> Now the clay-court tournaments in 
                    Europe are approaching . How do you see your chances?<br>
                    <b>Marat Safin:</b> I like to play on clay-court, though it 
                    cost a lot of energy. But it is funny, to develop a strategy 
                    like a chess player. I wish long for a French Open triumph. 
                    It would be the greatest in this moment of my career.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>tennis magazine:</b> Is your love for clay-court linked 
                    with your tennis adoptive country Spain?<br>
                    <b>Marat Safin:</b> Oh yes, I grew up their as a player. A 
                    nice, but a hard time. We played our hoarse, rummaged every 
                    day in sand, fighted like lions. That was a school, which 
                    formed myself. And the guys, with whom I was together, I still 
                    get along with them like with old class mates.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>tennis magazine:</b> But nevertheless you fond of your 
                    Russian home, of Moscow and their people, of Russia?<br>
                    <b>Marat Safin:</b> I have Russian soul. I like to live in 
                    my country. As much as I want to win as a single player all 
                    Grand Slams, so much I wish to win one day the Davis Cup as 
                    Russian. Sooner or later we fetch these dammed bowl, Yevgeny 
                    Kafelnikov and me, for sure.<br>
