                  20, 2002, Sports Palace &quot;Luzhniki&quot;, Moscow, RUS, by 
                  Nick Imison<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Marat Safin gave Russia a vital 1-0 lead over Argentina in their 
                  Davis Cup by BNP Paribas World Group Semifinal at Moscow’s Luzhniki 
                  Stadium this afternoon. The Russian No. 1 came from a set down 
                  to defeat Juan Ignacio Chela 67 75 75 61 in a tense four-set 
                  encounter lasting three hours and 10 minutes. <br>
<br>
It is said that the sign of a champion is someone who can 
                    win even when they’re not playing well. Today Safin managed 
                    to win despite struggling with the court surface, his nerves 
                    and the countless break points that he managed to squander 
                    en route to victory.<br>
<br>
The Russian came into the match boasting a 2-0 head-to-head 
                    record over his opponent, but it quickly became apparent that 
                    the Argentine was not to be going overawed by the occasion. 
                    Serving well and employing a powerful forehand, he stayed 
                    with Safin throughout a tight first set, saving the only break 
                    point either player faced, in the seventh game. <br>
<br>
The set went into a tiebreak, where Safin hit a backhand 
                    return winner on the first point, only to lose the next seven 
                    to send cheers throughout the small crowd of Argentine supporters.<br>
<br>
When Safin somehow contrived to miss seven break points at 
                    3-3 in the second set, it looked as though it was not going 
                    to be the Russian’s afternoon. However serving at 5-6 30-30, 
                    Chela saw an attempted forehand winner land just wide, and 
                    a forehand lob that landed long on the following point allowed 
                    Safin to level the contest.<br>
<br>
The turning point of the match came in the eighth game of 
                    the third set. The Argentine, who broke the increasingly vunerable 
                    Safin serve to lead 4-3, then committed two backhand errors 
                    at 40-15 on his own delivery to enable his opponent to tie 
                    up the set. The Russian then missed two set points at 5-4, 
                    three more at 6-5, and it was perhaps inevitable that it needed 
                    a Chela double fault to hand Safin the set on his sixth set 
                    point.<br>
<br>
With the loss of the third set, Chela’s head seemed to drop 
                    and he dropped his opening two services games to trail 4-0. 
                    Treatment for a foot injury merely delayed the outcome, with 
                    the Russian wrapping up the fourth set 61 to the delight of 
                    a packed stadium.<br>
<br>
Afterwards a delighted Safin confessed that he had been fortunate 
                    to pull out the match. “I always struggle to play on this 
                    surface, and have never had good results on it. I was very 
                    nervous at the beginning, but found my game in the third set 
                    and I think the decisive moment was breaking back for 4-4.”<br>
<br>
The Russian admitted that he feels additional pressure in 
                    the light of Yevgeny Kafelnikov’s announcement that he is 
                    to retire from tennis should Russia go on to capture the Davis 
                    Cup. “It is difficult enough to play a tie at home, but Yevgeny 
                    tells me almost every day that he wants to retire. I want 
                    to help him, and I want to help my country, and that places 
                    more pressure on me.”<br>
<br>
A disappointed Chela agreed he had squandered chances in 
                    the third set. “I had a big chance at 4-3 40-15, but I wasn’t 
                    focused enough and made mistakes. Marat played better than 
                    me on the important points. In the fourth set I became really 
                    tired and struggled to concentrate.”<br>
