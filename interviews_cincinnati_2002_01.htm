                  Marat Safin - G. Rusedski (GBR) 6-7(7-9), 2-6<br>
                  An Interview With: MARAT SAFIN</b><br>
<br>
 THE MODERATOR: Questions.<br>
<br>
Q. What happened in the second set? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Terrible, bad, just I cannot call it tennis, 
                    that's it. Just bad. Terrible.<br>
<br>
Q. Do you think you lost your focus?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I didn't lose my focus. I lost my game. That's 
                    what is going on. And that's it. That was my second set.<br>
<br>
Q. Any explanations, a little bit of wind problem, with 
                    your back?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Just playing bad. No confidence, I don't feel 
                    it. I have no confidence and it's really sad that the train 
                    is going away and I cannot jump on it. It's really sad.<br>
<br>
Q. The trainer is going away?<br>
<br>
THE MODERATOR: He means the train is going away and he can't 
                    jump on it. <br>
<br>
Q. Is this something just today or have you been having 
                    trouble lately? You won a couple of rounds up in Toronto...<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but still, like I don't have my game 
                    and I don't have ?? I don't have any shot, any special shot 
                    to play against all these guys and to beat them. I feel like 
                    I cannot beat them. That's what I am feeling right now. It's 
                    terrible.<br>
<br>
Q. Is it really a shot or it is something in your head because 
                    I mean, obviously ??<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: A shot you don't have to take it really, you 
                    know, it's ??<br>
<br>
Q. Feel like a critical situation coming into the Open? 
                    You have obviously had success there ??<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No, no, I mean, a shot, it means something 
                    that you have special in your game that I can use it against 
                    other guys and that's why I am beating the other guys, but 
                    right now in this moment, I have nothing to beat all these 
                    guys, I have nothing. I am just going on the court, I am just 
                    playing my match. I am making a great match, a few good points, 
                    people they can clap me and that's it. That's all I am doing. 
                    It is ridiculous. I am not satisfied with my game. I am not 
                    satisfied the way I am playing and it's not my game and I 
                    am not enjoying it anymore playing this way.<br>
<br>
Q. Is this critical though, you are going into the US Open, 
                    you have done really well there, obviously winning it, that 
                    you are not finding your game and you are pretty close ??<br>
<br>
 MARAT SAFIN: What I can do? What I can do? Let's way and 
                    let's see what is going to come out because this way definitely 
                    I will not make the first two rounds playing this way.<br>
<br>
Q. Do you have any ideas how to turn it around?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No. No idea. Completely lost. If I would have 
                    this idea, if I would have something in my mind, I would definitely 
                    change it. But that's why I am struggling. That's why I am 
                    losing first round in Cincinnati and it's really pissing me 
                    off and that is why I am losing my confidence, and I am not 
                    sure if I am going to be able to play US Open and try to win 
                    it. Definitely not, far away, far away from there, far away 
                    from getting into good shape and just do well there. It is 
                    difficult.<br>
<br>
Q. What are you going to try to do to prepare for the Open?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Practice, practice and practice. What are you 
                    going to do? Nothing else. Just you need to spend ?? if you 
                    need 10 hours I will stay 10 hours on the court. If I need 
                    24 hours I will have to stay 24 hours a day. There's no other 
                    solution to get better in tennis.<br>
<br>
Q. You had your chances in that first set, didn't you, you 
                    had three set points and looked as though you had your hands 
                    on the tiebreaker.<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: It means that you have no confidence. That 
                    you miss the shot and it's ?? everything is turning around 
                    and everything is going against you, that's tennis and that's 
                    ?? that means that you are in bad shape and that means that 
                    you are in a bad mood and that means you are not playing well. 
                    And it is really difficult to come out of this situation. 
                    I know this, everybody knows this, but nobody can help me 
                    as I can see. It's really sad. Really sad because I have been 
                    preparing for a long time, to come here to the States and 
                    try to do well because I was sure that I will do well here. 
                    Toronto, okay, it was quarterfinals, but still here, you know, 
                    when you are training for long time and trying to do well 
                    and winning a couple of tournaments and suddenly you lose 
                    in the first round, lose against Rusedski, I don't have anything 
                    against this guy, he played great tennis but still, just disappoint 
                    me so much that I have no power to move on, but I would have 
                    to. I still have two weeks, almost three weeks before the 
                    Open, but no idea.<br>
<br>
Q. You have been in this situation before, haven't you and 
                    you have come out of it and played well, at times earlier 
                    this year, for instance, you seemed to feel similar to this 
                    and came out and played well?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: But, right now, again in the same situation 
                    that I am playing bad, but now I am so lost that I cannot 
                    find where I can go and what I have to do to come back and 
                    play well because I was supposed to, you know, I was supposed 
                    to fighting for No. 1 in the world. I was supposed to win 
                    at least one tournament this year, a big one. I had so many 
                    chances and I just, you know, I couldn't make it and it's 
                    just coming one after another one and you feel like it's just 
                    you are losing ?? you are losing your game and at the end 
                    loses game completely, so to come back you need to do something 
                    which is ?? which will just change my game, just to maybe 
                    something else, but it's just ?? I don't know, I don't know 
                    what to do. Seriously I don't know what to do. I don't have 
                    no clue.<br>
<br>
 Q. Do you travel on your own here?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No, I have a coach. <br>
<br>
Q. You are with him now?<br>
<br>
 MARAT SAFIN: Yes.<br>
