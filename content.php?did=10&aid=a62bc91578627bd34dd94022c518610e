<TD vAlign=top colSpan=3><FONT size=2><U><STRONG>Press Conference of Marat Safin<BR>Madrid, 20th October 2006<BR>after loss in the Quarter Finals</STRONG><BR><BR><BR></U>Q. You fight back, but it was not enough. How frustrating is it? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, I'm actually more happy than frustrated because it's already my fifth week. I've been playing some great matches, a lot of matches, a lot of three&#8209;set matches. And of course out there I was completely flat. And in order to defeat players like Nalbandian, you have to be 100 percent fit and strong. Even though I had my chances, it didn't work my way. The referee made a couple of mistakes, and I didn't have any challenges left. I heard they were both in the last game they were in. The thought was upsetting with me, but what can I do. I'm pretty happy. My situation was much worse months ago. I was 104, now I am fighting into the Top&#8209;30. <BR><BR>Q. That was the third match in a row your opponent has been serving for the match and he increased his level markedly toward the end, didn't he? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Him? <BR><BR>Q. Yes.<BR>MARAT SAFIN: He didn't serve many first serves. But it's excuses, but still it's a lot has to do with paying attention to even though you can't just deal with the Hawk&#8209;Eye without paying attention and making over rules. Even though the balls were in and I heard about it, and unfortunately it's sad, but I don't think it really matters right now. But of course &#8209;&#8209; so what's the story here? It's a little bit disappointing. Nalbandian, he kept his mind on the court, and he was calm during the whole match. He had his chances. I had my chances. He was a little bit luckier at the end. That's how it is. I cannot say that he raised his level. He was just there. I made a couple of mistakes and let it slip away. <BR><BR>Q. You did seem to get your act together about halfway through the match. And you seemed to improve a lot after that. We thought that you mentally improved a lot through the course of that match? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: But also I don't have a lot of energy left, so I cannot just be shouting and discussing with everybody. There were a lot of things really pissed me off today, but I tried to stay calm. Of course it's tough. But like I said, five weeks in a row is difficult to keep the energy. So you need to save on anything you can and just keep yourself calm and whatever comes, comes.<BR><BR>Q. I'm not updated with your coaching status these days. We talked about the situation with your coach after the U.S. Open. You've been with Sasha. What is your coaching status these days? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: We decided to work with Sasha until the end of the year, and then I'll see was going to happen next year. I don't know. I definitely don't want to travel with 100 percent coach during all the weeks because it's a little bit tough. Especially I'm not 19&#8209;20 years old who needs the babysitter and somebody to bring the rackets and the sandwiches. It's somebody to come with me for 20 weeks to the most important tournaments and travel with the fitness coach and make it a little easier. I think that will be the better situation for me. <BR><BR>Q. How do you rate your level of game right now overall? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: It's much better. Like I said I've been struggling all the year. It looked like nothing was going my way. I lost a lot of matches 7&#8209;6 in the last set. And it was pretty disappointing. But I was fighting. My situation was even worse. Before the U.S. Open. I was 104 in the world, right now I'm fighting to get into the Top&#8209;30. It's a pretty good situation. I managed to have make all these points in the last four and a half months. I hope I can be seeded in the Australian Open. I'm just hoping for next year. For this year I'm not expecting anything anymore. <BR><BR>Q. Are you going to play Bercy? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Of course. <BR><BR>Q. But you need a wild card? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: No. <BR><BR>Q. You're in? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Protect. <BR><BR>Q. Davis Cup Finals, are you going to play the Argentineans? Do you think about it during the course of this match? And will the surface be faster than this one? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: No. It's going to be the same because Nalbandian, he beat me today doesn't mean anything. It's still 6&#8209;2 for me. I had so many chances, if I were fresher, I would have won in two sets without any problems. I'd like to play against him. He's a very comfortable player for me. It's going to be as fast as here. And I think we have pretty good chances. Hopefully the other players will be in good shape, me and Davydenko. I hope I can continue the same way for another two months so not to lose my game, even though that Europe is finishing in two weeks. <FONT style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"><!-- google_ad_section_end --></FONT></TD></TR>

<P><STRONG><U>Wednesday, August 30, 2006<BR>after 1st Round win v Robin Vik</U></STRONG></P>
<P>THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.</P>
<P>Q. Can you talk about it's been a long time since you won at this tournament. Got to feel pretty good to come out as a winner. <BR>MARAT SAFIN: What was the question? </P>
<P>Q. It's been a long time since you won here. It's got to feel nice. <BR>MARAT SAFIN: How I feel now? </P>
<P>Q. Does it feel good?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, it's just the first round. It feels much better when you win, that's for sure. When you win the first match, you have plenty of matches to go, and especially that you are not seeded you have to play against the seeded player, I guess. I guess against Nalbandian. I don't know what is the score. </P>
<P>Q. Is there any way of saying how close you are to 100% fit just now?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: You know how many times I answered this question already? Every time I say I am very close to it I find myself in a very difficult situation. So I guess I'm still far away and I'm looking for my best game. You know, looking in improving and trying to win my matches without playing well, which I think it's where you get the confidence, the most confidence, not playing well.</P>
<P>Q. What memories do you have from 2000 when you won here?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, just it was a long time ago. Was a different environment, different mentality. Everything was new, and right now I'm already eight years in the tour, so it's kind of lot of things has changed. I played already seven times here. Not much. <BR>Just since like a very long time ago, and that was a great feeling. I was young, and that's why I guess I won. I wasn't scared. Right now a lot of people are coming up and are playing great tennis, a lot of young people, so you have to compete against them. <BR>I found myself in a position where I'm already not the youngest player in the draw and everybody wants to beat me. My ranking is not I'm not any more top 10 so it's even tougher and nobody's scared of you anymore. It's not the same situation it used to be before.</P>
<P>Q. Are you aware of how much your fans live and die by your matches? If you go on to Internet, people see a breakpoint, they go, Oh, my God, Marat's going to lose it. Are you aware of the interest?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, I thank them for that, and I'm pretty happy that a lot of people like at 11 o'clock in the morning there was some people sitting there even with the terrible weather we have right now. They were sitting there clapping and applauding, they want you to win. It would be pretty great. <BR>I really think that during all these years when I was playing good and when I was playing bad, people still come to my matches and try to support me even though I was playing terribly. They were still behind me.<BR>I think it's a great feeling to be able to have so many fans and so many people really care about you. </P>
<P>Q. What are your coaching plans for the future? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: I don't know yet. We took one months off with Mr. Lundgren because I didn't know where I was going, and I found myself in a really tough position. I didn't win a lot of matches. I had difficult losses. So we decided to I decided myself to go into the States alone and just to see what's going on and make decision. We agreed to speak after the US Open and see what's happening.</P>
<P>Q. How many coaches have approached you and said, I'm available; you ought to hire me? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, a couple (smiling). Believe it or not, only two. </P>
<P>Q. What about Markus? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Okay, I'm gonna answer this question because I'm sick and tired of like everybody's coming to me and asking me the same question. It's really getting on my nerves. <BR>I was in Cincinnati and I was really like I had nothing to do. For me, being alone in Cincinnati have you ever been there (laughter)?<BR>So just go there and see how depressing is that place is. Then if somebody offers to play with you, you know, couple of times, and really is a nice guy. <BR>I think he is great guy, and I know him for a long time. Also from the challenger, when I was starting in the challengers I knew him already there because he was coaching some players. <BR>He offered me if you want to play with me a couple of times without no nothing involved, no coaching issues, just if you want to hit some balls, just let me know. <BR>So I hit with him couple of balls, and then all of a sudden everybody start to speak about that I'm splitting up with Lundgren and I'm going with Markus. <BR>No, it's not. I'm not with Gabriel Markus. He's the coach of Massu, and that's it. He's person I know and he try to help me a little bit, that's it. </P>
<P>Q. Do you think people try to take advantage of that? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Of what? </P>
<P>Q. You have a checkbook, talented player, of trying to hook up with you?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Who cares? I'm 104 in the world and I'm 26 years old, so I been already on the tour for eight years so try to bullshit me and nobody has a chance. <BR>So is like nobody can take advantage of me. I know what I want, I know what I need, and I'm looking for that. Just sometimes the things don't go the way you want them to go, and you trying, keep on trying. Then something will happen and I will decide what will happen. <BR>Hopefully, it will happen soon so I can get back in top hundred and start winning matches. I'm making some decisions right now. </P>
<P>Q. What do you want and what do you need? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, just I keep it in my head for the moment until I have everything clear, because I have a couple of things and a couple of thoughts in my head where I need to just speak to my people, think about it and make sure that it's clear and make sure that it is the right decision before I make any of them. </P>
<P>Q. Is your mother helping at all?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: No, my mother, she's just, you know, my mother.</P>
<P>Q. She's a coach. <BR>MARAT SAFIN: No, she's not. She's already in a pension, and the only way she can help me is by staying by having a pension and having a great time and coming here just to watch the kids, me and my sister, and enjoy it. They can make a tour in New York. That's it. That's what she should care about only.</P>
<P>Q. Do you spend a lot of time with her?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: No, a couple of days went out for dinner. Unfortunately they're staying uptown and I'm staying downtown, so it's quite difficult. She came here to help a little bit my sister, support her, and that's it. </P>
<P>Q. You speak of 2000 like ancient history. Do you feel mentally and physically capable of ever rekindling what it took to become that type of player to win here?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: No, it just was a different position. I was 20 years old and I had been playing great for all the summers. I made the finals of Indianapolis. I won Toronto. I played great in Cincinnati. I was coming here already playing great tennis. <BR>So for me it was much easier, and I had a lot of confidence. Right now I'm coming I won just in semifinals of Washington, and that's it. Then two first rounds in Masters Series events and now I'm here. So it's not the same position. I was 20. Nobody expect from me anything. The only thing they were talking that I'm, you know, the youngest guy in the tour and like a promise. <BR>Right now I'm already 26. So you're 26 years old and everybody asking what's going on, you not winning a lot of matches, your ranking dropped, and this kind of thing. It's completely different approach. </P>
<P>Q. Do you feel that you could become that level of player again?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: I want. I think I still have it for a lot of tennis. I just need to get put myself together, be a little bit lucky in some moments, and that's it. Everything will come back. I'm not retiring. I'm not planning to retire. <BR>I still think I can win a lot of tournaments, and I still think I can win a couple of Grand Slams, even if Federer will not play. I'm still waiting for my opportunities. </P>
<P>Q. You spoke about the ATP commitment issues in the past on different levels. What did you think about the new ATP plan: The Round Robin and Sunday starts and all these things? Do you support it?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, we spoke about it in Dubai. The meeting was Federer, was Nadal, me, Andre, and we sat down with Etienne. I think he's a great guy. I think he's great for tennis. Unfortunately, we have a lot of old guys running also an ATP that, in my opinion, should have been gone also, because you cannot have the same people from the old school and trying to make the tennis different. Could you imagine in ten years and they're still here and taking already different position. <BR>The new guys coming, and it's like kind of because he knows what he wants, Etienne. But at the beginning, when he came in, he didn't really knew where is it all going, and he wanted to make some changes. To be able to make some changes, you need to be updated by some of the players, which is we sit down in Dubai and we suggested him to make a little bit create something different. <BR>Because look's what happening, because the tennis is so even right now. For example, if you go to a tournament and you have like you bring Federer, you bring Roddick, Blake, or somebody else, you never know what's gonna happen, if they gonna arrive to the final or not. Not like before if you were bringing McEnroe and Borg, for example, it's gonna be for sure the final. Right now, you never know. <BR>So to be able to sell tickets and to be able to be successful, the tournaments to have success and have a great finals, they need to have a Round Robin. Because the good players, they always qualify to the quarterfinals, semifinals, and to the finals basically. <BR>So already Friday, Saturday, and Sunday they will have the good players playing for the championship. And Round Robin, I think it's a great thing. You play the same amount of matches as a normal tournament and you have a chance, even if Agassi is losing for example, if I'm losing the first round in the Round Robin, I still have a chance to qualify to the quarterfinals. <BR>So I think it's great for the good players. When they're unlucky and lose to somebody, they still have a chance, you know. Also for the tournament directors I think it's great. It's much better to sell the tickets.</P>
<P>Q. You're not worried about playing more matches?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: I don't care. I can play you know, like we have to support a little bit the tournaments and make sure that they are also the spectators, they get what they want. They don't want to see same finals. That's ridiculous. Like Casablanca, nobody's watching the finals. So it pays to have good players in the draw and make sure their good tennis players are in the final.</P>
<P>Q. Back in 2000 I think a lot of people thought you were going to be dominant for a long time. What do you think happened over the last six years? Is it injuries? Anything you can point to?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: The people, they were wrong (smiling). <BR>No, but then came Federer. I think it's difficult to compete against him. His tennis is too good. I been injured a couple of times and I missed a couple of years, so it's also kind of difficult when you drop out, and then to come back is quite it's very difficult. <BR>Then some new guys that are coming hungry, playing well, and they're not scared anymore, so that's how it happened. </P>
<P>Q. Your wrist injuries, your backhand wrist, what actually was that injury? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: I broke my ligaments. </P>
<P>Q. The TFC? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: I don't know how it's called. Here (indicating his wrist. ) Broke everything.</P>
<P>Q. On one shot?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, one shot. </P>
<P>Q. Cincinnati could have the next Super Bowl team. Is it really that bad a city? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: It's not Cincinnati, it's Mason. It's not even Cincinnati. It's Mason.</P>
<P>Q. Close to Cincinnati?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: No, it's not. It's only 25 miles away. I think it's not close.</P>
<P>Q. The bar was pretty lively at the Marriott, no? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, you guys enjoyed it, for sure. </P>
<P>Q. What do you think about the replay challenge system, and how does it change your emotional reactions to a shaky call? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, they have to improve a little bit because some of the you have the mark on the court, and then you show it on the HawkEye and it's completely different thing. Like the ball, for example, Vik, he challenged one ball. I knew it was wide, my serve. And wide by two centimeters. Then they showed on the HawkEye and it was in. It's kind of I don't understand how it works. <BR>I guess they have to improve a little bit to make sure that the calls are right because can change still can change a lot of matches this way.</P>
<P>Q. You're saying it's not accurate?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: I don't think it's hundred percent sure.</P>
<P>Q. Is it a mark or are you looking at a piece of yellow <BR>MARAT SAFIN: No, because mark is a mark. Mark, you cannot it's a fact. When they show replay, it's completely different way, it's touching the line. It was wide like that, and I saw the mark. <BR><BR>FastScripts by ASAP Sports...<BR><BR><STRONG><U></U></STRONG></P>

<P><NOINDEX><BR></P>
<P>THE MODERATOR: Questions. </P>
<P>Q. Did you feel like things were slipping away a little bit in the third and fourth sets?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, I just had the match in control after two sets and I let him come back. I wasn't really got a little bit scared because I was playing too well, then I start to think a little bit too much, I stop to attack, I change a little bit my game, then he started to play his tennis. That's, of course, difficult to compete against him on his way. </P>
<P>Q. Up and down career at the US Open. How does it feel to be in the second week playing good tennis?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Thanks to the rain, I'm in the second week. Actually, it feels pretty well, especially beating good players like Nalbandian. Hopefully I will play much better next match and I can continue heading closer to the final. </P>
<P>Q. Was it hard to concentrate at the end of the match with Agassi's game and so many distractions?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Actually not. You're so much into the game, you don't really care. Because you have already enough of your problems, you're so concentrated, you don't really pay attention to that. </P>
<P>Q. How did you feel you played in the tiebreaker in the fifth set?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, I started I was lucky to start with actually 5 1 in five minutes. I made double fault, he made double fault, then was the let. And the he shoot a couple of times and I played one lucky shot, 5 1. But then started went completely other direction. <BR>But it's like a lottery basically. It can go any way. </P>
<P>Q. He's so good countering, does he make you want to go for it on the points? Is it that you knew you had to be aggressive at that moment?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: No, just the nerves are really like at hundred percent. Of course, you don't want to find yourself in a losing position serving. You go for a little bit too much, maybe you're a little bit too scared just to make sure you place it in the right spot. You are in control of the point. Of course, it's a tiebreak, so the nerves are there. </P>
<P>Q. You have a pretty good five set record. You beat Grosjean. What do you tell yourself in a fifth set? How do you keep it together?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Just keep on trying, keep on trying. Not much you can do. You cannot start putting the balls inside the court and wait for the mistakes of other players. You have to attack. If it goes in, it goes in. If it doesn't goes in, it really doesn't. To be on the baseline, try to wait for mistakes, I'm not going to win a lot of matches anyway. That's my tennis. That's how I should play. <BR>Of course, it's a lot of risk also I'm taking. That's my tennis. I have to live with that, and I'm living pretty well. </P>
<P>Q. Do you think at one point Nalbandian got a little down on himself, the dropshots he missed? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, the dropshot he missed on match point, of course it's nerves, it's nothing else. He did everything right. He gets too scared. He wanted to make it too perfect. But I was not getting any closer to the dropshot. He went for a little bit too much. </P>
<P>Q. As you try to regain your best form, how much has the coaching played a part in that?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, it's very important to have somebody right now in my position to have somebody to push me and give me a little bit of confidence and try to understand me, what's going on in my head not only tennis, but also some other stuff, to be able to support me and also in difficult moments sometimes to speak to me in the match because it's pretty like it's a lot of pressure I'm going through. Also on the matches, especially long ones, you need somebody behind you. You need somebody to be there for you basically. Alex, he knows me pretty well from long time ago, so he's kind of just, in the sense, my situation. We can speak the same language, in the sense, and he understands what's going on. So it makes me really happy. </P>
<P>Q. Have you been feeling more comfortable lately?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: It's the only guy that we can speak about he is one of my closest friends, off the courts also. He knows pretty much about my life. He also can he's a little bit older. He has a lot of experience in life. He understands. He's been a player. He's been a great player. Just more mental part so I can cry on his shoulder basically. He understands. He puts me together. He want me to win, which is great. He's there for me from the beginning till the end. </P>
<P>Q. Having won a US Open title, do you feel that's the expectation for you every year from then on, and in other people's eyes, it's a letdown if you don't get that far?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: I won it six years ago. I made the semifinal here 2002 I guess. Of course, every time you come back, once you win it, you want to get closer to the final. You don't really pay attention to the first couple of rounds. You just want to get there somehow. <BR>But now these days, it's a little bit different story. A lot of things have changed. A lot of good players left, and some other players came. The young ones, they're hungry. You have to run from day one until the end. There's no any more easy matches. Anybody can beat anybody. You have to be really focused. It's not easy as it used to be. </P>
<P>Q. When did you start that relationship, player/coach relationship? Why did you ultimately choose him?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, because I was here for one month and a half. I was getting really not really lonely, but I need some help. I called him because he's the only person that I can that I know him for really let's say '97. He been great to me throughout the years. I just ask him to come and just help me, just to be able to understand me. <BR>He's the one that I'm playing with tennis with him when I'm back in Moscow. He's like a sparring and he understands. He feels me. That's why I took him. I ask him to help, and he flew over. He's here and he helping me, wants to make sure that I'll be winning. </P>
<P>Q. What is your opinion on Argentine tennis nowadays?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, great players. I mean, not great past with all the doping things and all the other things around. But I'm not going to judge it. Everybody takes their own sensibility. Otherwise you have a great school. You have great players, I don't know how many players in top hundred, but also a lot of players that are coming from 100 to 200 and higher. Everybody's great. Everybody's working hard. <BR>I think it's just coming from a great school. Keep it up. <BR><BR>FastScripts by ASAP Sports</P>

<P><STRONG><U>Monday, September 4, 2006<BR>after&nbsp;win v Olivier Rochus</U></STRONG></P>
<P><NOINDEX>THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. </P>
<P>Q. He's been a problem in your past. You took control. What was the key? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, just he's a very uncomfortable player for me. Sometimes when you're not playing really well and you're not playing the right way, sometimes you are a little bit too scared to do things. If you have confidence, it's a little bit easier because you can go to the line, move him around. <BR>Otherwise, if you stick to his game, then basically you have no choice. It happens when you are out of confidence or shape. </P>
<P>Q. December of 1995, Moscow, U.S. versus Russia Davis Cup. Did you watch this on TV?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: No, I was in Spain. </P>
<P>Q. You had no interest in the match at that time? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Not really. Of course I wanted our team to win because it would be the first time in the history.</P>
<P>Q. When the U.S. comes back to Moscow in a few weeks, how important will that match be for Russian tennis fans who remembered this loss? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Oh, it's too...<BR>BUD COLLINS: Did I miss anything good? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Nothing interesting, nothing interesting. <BR>BUD COLLINS: I can't believe that. <BR>MARAT SAFIN: We're waiting for you. <BR>No, just has nothing to do. Was a huge mistake by the Russians. With all the respect to the players, to Chesnokov and Kafelnikov, they should have won, especially on clay. Play against Sampras and Courier, we should have won, that's for sure. Somehow, it slipped away. <BR>Only six years later, we won it. So right now, we are also playing for it's a big match for us. I think we're gonna win we hope we believe we're gonna win the Davis Cup this year. We are going pretty strong, you know, coming to this match. We are gonna practice hard, try to be in the final. This will be our second how you call it? the trophy, and I think we are very close to it.</P>
<P>Q. Would you like to see that clay very heavy, maybe even wet?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Slow. As slow as possible. I think we have all the cards in our hands.</P>
<P>Q. Given the number of big men like yourself and big hitters on the tour, does it amaze you that Olivier can compete as well as he does week in, week out? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but a lot of people underestimate him. It has nothing to do with the of course everybody looks and nobody talks about it, but everybody looks at his height. Has nothing to do. Jaime Yzaga, if you remember, used to be a great player. He beat Sampras and others. He's very stable. Rochus, he knows how to play tennis. He's been around. He has experience. He's moving very well. He reads the game very well. He can hit off both sides. Returns well. Good volleys. Anticipation is amazing. Good touch. I don't understand why the people, they still thinking that the big guys, they should beat the small guys. Look at Michael Chang. He wasn't tall either. </P>
<P>Q. You hate to play him? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: It's kind of he has a kind of Santoro game, because if you start to play his game, he moves you around, he puts you at his pace slice, dropshots, hitting hard, hitting slow, serving, a lot of variation of his game. So it's pretty difficult to find your rhythm once you start to play his game. </P>
<P>Q. Now that you got into the fourth round, you didn't have you haven't had the greatest of summers on hard courts, but three good matches here. Do your expectations change for the tournament? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Not really. I mean, I had very difficult year. With all the results that I had lately, I just I try to play my game. Whatever comes, comes. I think I did pretty well so far, so I want to stick to it, stick to this tactic, and play another match against Haas. I think it will be really tight tomorrow. I'm a little bit maybe lucky. I have little bit advantage playing tomorrow.</P>
<P>Q. Are you the type of person who can maintain confidence over a couple weeks, or is it much more on the day for you? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Right now, I don't know. I don't really know, because I haven't been playing well at all. All the summer I came here, especially to get some points, to get my ranking a little bit better. I came here in middle of the July, and what I did is just make one semifinal, and I did nothing in the Masters Series. So it's pretty disappointing for me. But thanks, God, I'm doing pretty well here for the moment. Let's see where it will take me.</P>
<P>Q. Through highs and lows here, people, fans have always stayed with you. Why do you think people connect with your game? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Ask people (smiling). I don't know. </P>
<P>Q. What's the most frustrating part of being Marat Safin? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Huh? </P>
<P>Q. What's the most frustrating part of being Marat Safin?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Frustrating part, well, it's just every time I've been playing well and every time I was in the top 10, I had one year, one great year, then I was getting injured and I had to start all over again. I really am tired a little bit of making comebacks. </P>
<P>Q. What do you tell yourself? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: What do I tell myself, I have to deal with situation. But also is not it's not easy to come back. A lot of people don't understand that once you've been there, you slip out, and being 88 in the world or right now I'm out of hundred, to come back, come back again, it's really it's very, very difficult. </P>
<P>Q. Finally, what's more impressive, a top player who can really stay at the top for a long, long time obviously, Pete Sampras, the best example. <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, he didn't get injured.</P>
<P>Q. Or a player that comes back from really serious injury like Andre Agassi did, to come back to the very top. <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, it's different. Everybody you cannot judge, you know, by every person is different. Every person has different mentality, different character, different. It's just we are different. <BR>So some people, they take it easy, and some people, they little bit start to stress out a little bit. Then they are finding themselves in a position and they need to find a way out and they need somehow. Some other people, like Sampras, he was like a wall; nobody could break him. So that's why he maintain himself there without slipping. <BR>Not like Agassi, because he was maybe a little bit emotional, and he had some problems out of the court, I guess. I don't know. I wasn't there. So he needed some help. He slipped away and then he came back. <BR>But it's really, really tough. It's difficult for everybody to do that. </P>
<P>Q. I am sure you are gonna win a lot of things still, but till now, how do you think tennis will remember Marat Safin?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: I'm not retiring yet (smiling). I have another four years. Let's see what's gonna happen there. Maybe I can win one or two Grand Slams. Would be great if Federer will not play there. Then we'll see. We'll see how, first of all, how I will take it, when I will retire. And then of course let's see how the people, they will say good bye to me.</P>
<P>Q. Sometimes it seems you have a very low opinion of yourself. You just mentioned Federer. 2005 Australian Open you beat him. You've been a No. 1 player, won two Grand Slams. Pretty much beaten every guy out there. Where does that come from, the lack of confidence?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, like I said. Once, for example, my position, I got injured quite a lot. In 2001, I was injured with the ribs, then the wrist, then elbow I had problems, then I had problems with the knee. So it's kind of difficult because everybody, like for example Federer, he been playing for the last five years without injuries. So he's continuously playing. <BR>For example, for me, when I stop and I didn't play for six months, I couldn't really walk straight, you have to start all over again. Then to try to play a little bit of tennis without moving, then you need to find the rhythm to play matches, confidence. You start to see the ranking, that you are dropping and you have to defend a lot of points. The people, the people's opinion everywhere, You should have done that, you should have done that... (cell phone ringing.)</P>
<P>Q. Do you truly love this game, or are you just playing because this is what you know how to do, this is what you were brought up to do? Do you have the same kind of love of the game Andre had?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, of course Andre didn't play for the money. That's for sure. He has enough, and much more. So I guess you have to give something back. What else? There are much more things you can do in life, that's for sure. Also in Andre's position, I'm sure he's pretty big in Las Vegas and he has a lot of opportunities outside of tennis. <BR>But once you dedicate your youth, basically all your life to tennis, and all of a sudden to achieve something and then say, Bye bye, thank you very much and try to do something else, it's one of like Rios, he did that. I think you have to give to the tennis as much as you can, everything, so you don't have any regrets, and give to spectators. And basically everything what Agassi and Rios, and some other guys, what they have in life is thanks to the tennis. So just to take as much as you can and then just leave, I don't think is the right way. </P>
<P>Q. What are your thoughts on instant replay? Have you enjoyed it? Do you think it's successful?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, it's a little bit stressful right now because I'm playing every single day. I played yesterday five set match, I played today, and then I have to play tomorrow against Haas. So it's not really fun. You cannot really enjoy the city and, you know, just be...</P>
<P>Q. The instant replay, have you found it successful, the HawkEye?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Oh, HawkEye, sorry. </P>
<P>Q. No, that's okay. <BR>MARAT SAFIN: But is not I don't think it's hundred percent right.</P>
<P>Q. You don't think it's 100% right?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: No. No, no, no. I'm sure about that. I already said that. </P>
<P>Q. Why?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Why? You think I'm lying? </P>
<P>Q. No, no. Why isn't it right?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Because it's not right. Because you have the marks on the court. They're saying it's out. Then you have HawkEye, the ball is in. I don't think it's the right thing. I think you have to go with the it's not like hypothetically. You have the mark there, it's a fact. You can't fight it. You see the mark. Like for example, the one ball yesterday against Nalbandian was a mark, this wide (indicating). And then I check it, I challenge it, and they said that it's in. And, really, it's like touching the line, so I don't think it's hundred percent correct.</P>
<P>Q. The way you played this summer and the way you're playing, when you go to play tomorrow, the shots you will hit, the shots you've hit this tournament so far, will you feel better about them? What did you feel about those shots in tournaments this summer and now you feel different about them, or do you?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, five set matches, US Open, everything is right. I practiced. I came here a little bit early. I was hitting balls every day for a few hours. So everything for the moment looks right. I'm doing the right things, and the balls looks like they are landing inside the court. <BR>I'm moving better, faster. Better anticipation. Basically, enjoying it a little bit more. I'm having fun on the court, so I guess it's New York. <BR><BR>FastScripts by ASAP Sports...</P>
<P><BR>&nbsp;<STRONG><U>Wednesday, September 6, 2006<BR>after loss v Tommy Haas</U></STRONG></P>
<P>THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. </P>
<P>Q. A long and exhausting match. Do you feel like you left everything out there? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, well, I had my opportunities unfortunately, that's why I'm a little bit disappointed with the way I played today. It should have been even fourth sets. In the fourth set, we made to each other twice a break. The guy everything was on my side. Suddenly, it just slipped away. <BR>Also in the tiebreak, two balls that I missed that cost me basically the match. <BR>So I played pretty well, but in important moments I didn't do anything special and make I missed them, opportunities. </P>
<P>Q. Tommy is a player that a few years ago he was part of that New Balls, Please campaign, a lot of people were expecting big things of Tommy. He encountered some injuries, years he wasn't able to play at all. Do you think he may be coming into his best?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, he been injured for three years I think with his shoulder. It just is difficult to come back straightaway. Then it took him a while. Right now he's more mature. He has more experience, 28 years old. He knows how to play. Basically, he has complete game. He can volley. He can play from the baseline. Good serve. Pretty solid player. So that's why he put everything together. He's focused. Good coach. That's why the results are coming right now. It looks like that step by step he knows what he's doing. <BR>Unfortunately, the injuries I think got him a little bit in a bad position when he was 24, 25. Took away from him his game. He was No. 2 in the world back then. </P>
<P>Q. Obviously, you lose, you feel disappointed. That goes without saying. Considering you have gone as far as you did, to go to a fifth set, play it out like that, can you be satisfied with your performance here? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, if you look in the big picture, the way I played during last six months, right now I'm playing one of my best tennis actually. Just here was in a tiebreak one, two points that made the difference basically. Like I said, it's a lottery. Luck was on his side. <BR>I'm playing much better. I mean, I couldn't think that I would beat anybody coming here, coming to US Open. The way I played the whole summer was terrible. Couldn't beat basically anybody. It was something here, I beat Nalbandian, I beat Rochus that I never like to play against him. I was just a few points away against Tommy. So, overall, it's pretty good.</P>
<P>Q. Can you talk about, when you go out to compete, how much of how you perform is mental, how you're thinking, where your head is. Or, is it a matter of training and how you've been doing and how you wake up that day? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: No, is just not like that. We already in a at a high performance. Professionals, we basically dedicate ourselves, all our lives, to become what we are right now. So everything, it becomes mental after a while. Once you become pro and you become a pretty good pro, it just is not anymore the technique. It's not anymore the serve. It's not anymore the forehand, backhand, or serve and volley, something like that. It's just a mental thing to keep yourself cool sometimes, and sometimes to push yourself to risk it at important moments, or try to stay back and make the right decisions at the right moment. <BR>Because everybody can play backhand and forehand. There's no problem. I think who is tougher mentally is winning basically. So this is just it's already who is better mentally prepared is basically top 10 players. It's unbelievable. They just focused throughout the match. No ups and downs. They know exactly what to do in important moments. That's why it makes such a big difference. Because tennis, everybody has. </P>
<P>Q. While you were on the court, were you aware at all of what was going on in your sister's match?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, they showed a couple of times a few shots from her court, and I was following her. </P>
<P>Q. Can you just talk about the emotions. If she would have won, that would have cheered you up a little bit. It's kind of a double whammy in that sense. <BR>MARAT SAFIN: No, it's okay. She's doing much better than me. She's No. 12 in the world. She made the quarterfinals. She's basically on her way to become a top 10 player in a couple of weeks. So I'm not worried about her. I should worry about a little bit more myself. </P>
<P>Q. Speaking about yourself, how is the knee? Is it a factor still? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: No. Everything's perfect. I'm moving around without any problems, no pain. Just if I continue this way, physically and mentally, I think I can pull it through. But physically, I'm perfect. </P>
<P>Q. I wanted to ask you a little bit about the development of men's and women's tennis in Russia. In China right now, the question is will they ever have a men's player that's so great because the women are going so well. You and your sister have a pretty interesting history as far as experiencing the development of men's and women's tennis in Russia. Are men and women in Russia riding the same wave? Is there a difference in the way the sports have developed for men and women?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: With all due respect, you cannot compare the men to the women. Why is simple. Because the tennis, women's tennis, is a little bit more simple than the men's, unfortunately, you know, with all the respect to the women. It's a little bit easier to become a pro, to become a top hundred player. Right now we have I don't know how many girls, maybe 20, 30 girls, who have their that make it. It's unbelievable. <BR>From the guys, it takes a little bit longer because the competition is a little bit harder. Satellites, futures, challengers, you have to somehow be more stable in the head because a lot of temptations are around. It's difficult to find a sponsor for the guys. Also, you know, like when they young, they want to fool around. That's why a lot of talents, they never became anything. <BR>We have great players in Russia, Juniors, but somehow nobody knows how to explain to them what to do, they should do. All the time I speak to anybody, they come with excuses, I'm not going here, I'm not going there, this one hurts, my wrist, I have another week in Moscow. All of a sudden, you don't see them do anything in a year, they quit. That's just disappointing a little bit. <BR>I think somebody has to put them in the right direction, guide them a little bit, because they don't have much experience. It's disappointing for us because we have really a lot of talents. <BR>The women are more consistent. They work much harder. They dedicate them self fully to tennis and they can stay on the court forever. The guys, it's just way too many temptations.</P>
<P>Q. Is that universal across all the men everywhere, or do you feel that's a specific thing for Russia? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, I'm not gonna talk for other countries, but for Russia right now, what I saw, basically what I saw in Moscow, it's just the way it is. All the time they come with excuse. Everything is just, This week, no, because I'm injured, and then I'm injured again, and then I don't know, maybe, I have no Visa. All the time, the excuses. Nobody will stop them and explain them what they should do. It's just one year, two years, and then everything the train is gone and you can't jump on it unfortunately.</P>
<P>Q. Dinara was in here when you were out there in the fifth set. She was talking just a little bit about the advice you had given her over the years, and specifically about the <BR>MARAT SAFIN: I hope the good advices (smiling).</P>
<P>Q. Well, what have you told her? She was talking about the racquet throwing, how you would tell her to calm down a little bit. Is that advice that you have imparted to her? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: Well, not exactly. She just put it in a different way. But I had some issues with her that doesn't I'm not gonna go into details. But some things I didn't really like, and I really told her, you know, because it's just it's unacceptable from her side to do some things on the court what she was doing before. Right now, she stopped doing that, looks like that. Look at her right now. She was top 50, 50, 60, 40, 30, jumping all around. Right now, she's basically cracking top 10. So it really worked. <BR>So it was pretty good advice, I guess (smiling).</P>
<P>Q. Is it advice you would follow for yourself? <BR>MARAT SAFIN: No, when you're 26, it's difficult to change. You can't teach the old dog to sit, huh? </P>
<P>Q. Does Dinara ever actually attempt to give you advice in any way since she's gotten successful, or is it always older brother/younger sister?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: I'm really not interfering with her tennis at all. She has a coach, and I respect everything. The guy is doing pretty good job. Just I have nothing to do with that, you know. Some things, just outside of tennis, she can come and ask me anything. Inside of tennis, I trust fully Glenn and I think he's the right guy for her. I don't want to mess around and just make him feel uncomfortable and make speak about something which is it's not my job. He's getting paid for this, and he knows what he's doing, and he's doing really good job. </P>
<P>Q. Has she ever given you advice and say, Hey, Marat, you might want to try this? Is that something that would never happen, you're the older brother?<BR>MARAT SAFIN: It would never happen (smiling). <BR><BR>FastScripts by ASAP Sports...<BR></P></td>
