                  <br>
                  Source: The Sunday Telegraph - London <br>
                  Publication date: 2001-06-24<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  It says a lot about Marat Safin that, as the first recipient 
                  of the title `Most Quotable Player of the Year' from the International 
                  Tennis Writers' Association, he promptly refused to attend his 
                  next press conference of any significance and left the quotes 
                  cupboard dry. <br>
                  The journalists who had voted for him felt more than a touch 
                  of embarrassment when Safin was docked $10,000 for his behaviour 
                  after he was beaten in the third round of Roland Garros by Fabrice 
                  Santoro. But Safin, who has always had to be handled with due 
                  care and attention, was told he had to speak to the press and 
                  stormed away. An arm around the shoulder, a proper cooling-off 
                  period and all might have been well. <br>
                  <br>
                  In this day and age, though, no-one is prepared to wait a while. 
                  The instant gratification of the on court, or even worse, the 
                  off- court interview when the player can hardly breath and often 
                  leaves the chair stained in sweat, is all the rage and Safin 
                  is a man who needs to simmer slowly. There is a restless urge 
                  about the 21-year- old Russian that cannot be rushed. <br>
                  <br>
                  We chat for 20 minutes and he doesn't want to let go of the 
                  cap perched on his head for fear that if he released his grip, 
                  the evocative emotions bubbling in his head will cause an explosion. 
                  When he speaks you might expect him to express himself in the 
                  powerful manner in which we believe all Russians speak, instead 
                  you have to lean towards him to pick up what he is saying.<br>
                  <br>
                  Is this the racket smasher of old Moscow Town, the man who has 
                  had more mangled frames than hot samovars? Well, Dunlop certainly 
                  hope Safin has conquered the rage after their mega-dollar link 
                  with the player to endorse their new range. It is with this 
                  black-rimmed, black-handled implement that he hopes to do real 
                  damage on grass for the first time.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin's record at Wimbledon is played three, won one, which 
                  hardly befits the highest-ranked player in the field, the young 
                  man who took the sport by storm nine months ago with a bravura 
                  performance in New York, his straight sets defeat of Pete Sampras 
                  in the final coming as close to perfection as anything the great 
                  man himself had produced on his favoured grass. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Those kind of weeks can happen,&quot; he says, &quot;people 
                  who have qualified for the second week of a Grand Slam have 
                  passed through tough matches and won and there will for sure 
                  be matches you should have lost when you have struggled. All 
                  of sudden, you start to play huge tennis, no-one can stop you 
                  and that is what happened to me at Flushing Meadow. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Nobody had a chance against me. I hope it will be this 
                  way in these two weeks. It's going well on the grass. I think 
                  this year will be successful because I am prepared, I have a 
                  coach (Swede Mats Wilander, who was three times a Wimbledon 
                  quarter-finalist in the late Eighties) and I'm hitting the ball 
                  very good. I know the grass, it doesn't matter they say they've 
                  improved it, it's going to be the same thing like always, some 
                  bad points and not many rallies, it's not going to change. But 
                  I want to play.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  For Safin, the desire to be out there is everything. Imagine 
                  the lad locked up for any period of time, he would go mad. When 
                  he does smile, it's no wonder he is said to melt a female heart 
                  from 10 paces. Only a couple of times during an autograph-signing 
                  session in the John Lewis store on Oxford Steet could he manage 
                  to raise his eyes above the level of his peaked cap.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;He's not a morning person,&quot; said the ebullient Andy 
                  Fyfe, who has the unenviable task this fortnight of handling 
                  the twin combustive personalities that are Safin and Goran Ivanisevic. 
                  Safin would probably have preferred a lie-in that morning but 
                  there was work to be done, people to be seen, opinions to be 
                  extracted. <br>
                  <br>
                  You have to pinch yourself a little to realise that the young 
                  fuzzy-cheeked man came within a match of being crowned world 
                  No 1 in 2000. Safin won seven titles in the year, becoming the 
                  youngest player to finish No 2 in the world since the 19-year-old 
                  Boris Becker in 1986. He was also the first under 21 to win 
                  as many championships in one year since Wilander in 1983 - the 
                  year the Swede won the Australian Open and just failed to retain 
                  his Roland Garros title when he succumbed to Yannick Noah.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Don't forget also,&quot; says Safin, &quot;that when I 
                  started in 2000 I was 25 in the world and, after four months 
                  when I couldn't win a match, I was down to 48. And when suddenly 
                  my attitude changed with a new coach [the droll Russian, Andrei 
                  Chesnokov] I won back-to-back titles, won two Masters Series 
                  titles, a Grand Slam and got to No 1. I have to be satisfied 
                  to finish the year No 2. <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin does not believe his preference for the back of the court 
                  hinders his prospects. Anyone who can nullify Sampras so completely 
                  as he did at the US Open last September bears consideration 
                  whether you are playing on grass or sand. &quot;Guys like Borg 
                  and Agassi have won this tournament,&quot; he says. &quot;It 
                  can be the same this time, why not? <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;If I feel good about myself then nobody can stop me, actually. 
                  They don't have a chance against me. My problem is getting the 
                  confidence in the first place and I have that now.&quot; <br>
