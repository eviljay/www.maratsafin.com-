                  04, 2002, Sports Palace &quot;Luzhniki&quot;, Moscow, RUS, by 
                  Nick Imison<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  If Russia is to go on and win its first Davis Cup title, it 
                  will first have to end another losing streak this weekend when 
                  it takes on Sweden in the quarterfinals of the 2002 Davis Cup 
                  by BNP Paribas in Moscow.<br>
<br>
The Russians have lost all four previous encounters against 
                    Sweden, most recently in last year's quarterfinals, where 
                    they were outplayed 4-1 in Malmo. With Marat Safin out through 
                    injury, Yevgeny Kafelnikov was unable to shoulder the burden 
                    singlehanded, and the Swedes wrapped up victory with a day 
                    to spare.<br>
<br>
If anything it is the Swedes who are understrength on this 
                    occasion. Their most successful clay court player Magnus Norman 
                    has only recently returned to the tour after undergoing surgery 
                    on his left hip, and is not yet ready for a test such as this. 
                    And it is on clay that this three-day tie will be played, 
                    a surface on which Kafelnikov has won Roland Garros and Safin 
                    has won two other titles.<br>
<br>
In contrast the Swedish No. 1 Thomas Johansson has never 
                    progressed beyond the second round at Roland Garros, but the 
                    27-year-old from Linkoping is currently riding the crest of 
                    a wave having stunned the tennis world by capturing the Australian 
                    Open in January for his first Grand Slam title. He then came 
                    back from injury to defeat Greg Rusedski in the deciding fifth 
                    rubber of Sweden's first round Davis Cup victory over Great 
                    Britain in Birmingham.<br>
<br>
Johansson will be looking to take what he sees as a mental 
                    edge into the opening singles rubber against Safin, his Australian 
                    Open final victim. &quot;We have played four times, but never 
                    on clay so it will be a completely different game with a lot 
                    of ralleys. I am sure he still remembers the last match, so 
                    hopefully I have a little bit of an advantage.&quot;<br>
<br>
Safin remains something of an enigma in tennis, combining 
                    the sort of brilliance which saw him capture the 2000 US Open 
                    title with form that has seen him win only one of his last 
                    six Davis Cup singles rubbers. Fortunately for Safin, and 
                    for Russia, that one win came in the fifth rubber of its first 
                    round meeting with Switzerland, when he overcame Michel Kratochvil 
                    in straight sets to seal a place in the quarterfinals.<br>
<br>
The Russian No. 1 Yevgeny Kafelnikov boasts a more impressive 
                    29-13 career singles record in Davis Cup, and he will be looking 
                    to improve those statistics against Thomas Enqvist in the 
                    day's second singles rubber. Like Johansson, most of Enqvist's 
                    successes have come on faster surfaces, but he was the hero 
                    of Sweden's first round victory, recording straight sets victories 
                    over Rusedski and Tim Henman.<br>
<br>
Carl-Axel Hageskog, Sweden's long-time captain, admitted 
                    that the surface did favour the home team. &quot;This is certainly 
                    not our best surface. However the court is faster indoors 
                    and suits anyone with a good serve and good groundstrokes. 
                    My team have all played a lot on clay since a young age and 
                    I don't think it will be a problem for them.&quot;<br>
<br>
So the stage is set for a fascinating quarterfinal between 
                    a team with a history of long term success in Davis Cup and 
                    a team desperate to become part of that history.<br>
<br>
As Kafelnikov himself said: &quot;I have achieved most of 
                    the goals in tennis, Grand Slam titles, an Olympic gold medal, 
                    becoming World No. 1. The one thing left to give me full satisfaction 
                    is to win the Davis Cup.&quot;<br>
<br>
Saturday's doubles sees the experienced Davis Cup pairing 
                    of Kafelnikov and Safin drawn to face Jonas Bjorkman and Johansson, 
                    who made a losing debut against Great Britain. In Sunday's 
                    reverse singles, Kafelnikov is first up against Johansson, 
                    followed by Safin versus Enqvist. <br>
<br>
Both captains are able to make late substitutions on either 
                    day, taking into account the results to date and the physical 
                    condition of the players. Hageskog used that tactic most effectively 
                    in Sweden's victory over Great Britain, but Kafelnikov and 
                    Safin are long used to playing on all three days. Whether 
                    they need to remains to be seen.<br>
