                    from the French sport Newspaper &quot;l'equipe&quot; (May 
                    23th).<br>
                    translated by Violaine<br>
                    <br>
                    <i>I'm sorry if the English is not very good, and I hope that 
                    you will understand it, because I think it is quite interesting.Violaine</i><br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    L'equipe: How are you feeling a few days before Roland Garros?<br>
                    Marat Safin: Im' feeling like someone who has been injured 
                    and who hasn't plazyed a real tennis match since a month and 
                    a half. i need some good fights to get my confidence back 
                    and that's why I'm here in Dusseldorf this week, where I'm 
                    sure I will play at least 3 tough matches (single and double). 
                    The goal is to win one or two times, to feel the ball to be 
                    ready for Paris.<br>
                    <br>
                    L'equipe : Have you recovered from your back injury?<br>
                    MS: Completely. I feel very good physically, ready for 5 set 
                    matches.<br>
                    <br>
                    L'equipe: Despite the injury you got in February in Dubai, 
                    you didn't stop playing, and playing bad. Why didn't you stop 
                    to take care of yourself?<br>
                    <br>
                    MS: Because there were too much money at stake in the following 
                    tounaments. What I would have lost not playing was so huge 
                    that I didn't even asked myself about it. People can criticize 
                    me saying that I'm playing for money, but if they knew how 
                    much money it was(*) and if they were me, they would do the 
                    same.You know, it's only the beginning of my career, and i 
                    can't do like Pete Sampras, for example, who has since a long 
                    time enough money to secure his future and doesn't have to 
                    count. I have to win enough money to secure not only my future, 
                    but also my mother's, my father's, my sister's, her boyfriend's, 
                    my girlfriend's... I feel responsible of everybody. It is 
                    a big responsability. And I don't know how many time I will 
                    play. So I couldn't afford letting this money go <br>
                    <br>
                    (*): Ending 2nd at the end of year 2000, Marat Safin was given 
                    a 1.4 million dollar bonus by the atp, that he will get only 
                    if he plays in every tournaments of the Grand Slam and the 
                    Masters Series over 2 years (2000 and 2001). A withdrawal 
                    would have cost him $350.000, 2 withdrawal $700.000 and 3, 
                    all his bonus. That's why despite his injury, he played in 
                    the 5 first Masters Series of the year.<br>
                    <br>
                    L'equipe: Did your injury get worse becasue you didn't stop?<br>
                    <br>
                    MS: No, but it is sure that I would have recovered faster 
                    if I had stopped.<br>
                    <br>
                    L'equipe: Before your injury, you already had played bad at 
                    the beginning of the year. What happened?<br>
                    MS: I did'nt work enough during the close season : only ten 
                    days before going to Australia. It's not enough. Usually, 
                    I train during one month, but this year the season ended later 
                    becasue of the Masters Cup. I was completely exhausted and 
                    frustrated by all hte efforts I made to end up the year number 
                    one in the world. It is sure that I played too much during 
                    the last months last year, but you should have been crazy 
                    not trying everything to finish the yeat number one.<br>
                    Once the Masters finished and the first rank gone, I was not 
                    able to do anything during several weeks. Then, I started 
                    playing tennis too fastn and the muscles of my arm that were 
                    still tired didn't endure it. I had a lot of pain in my elbow, 
                    that's why I played bad at the beginning of the year. I still 
                    think that I still suffer from last year's excessesn but I 
                    don't regret it. I'm young, and if I am in the same situation 
                    in the future, I will be careful. I'm also telling me that 
                    I'm only 20, and 20 is not when you play your best tennis. 
                    This means that the best is still to come for me.<br>
                    <br>
                    L'equipe: Will having Mats Wilander as a coach give you more 
                    serenity?<br>
                    <br>
                    MS: It is a great honor to work with such a famous former 
                    champion. Of course he will give me many things. We have a 
                    deal of collaboration during one year, not a contract, just 
                    a deal. We'll see after. So that it works out, I have to trust 
                    him totally and he also has to trust me. If the relation between 
                    us is perfect, he will have me exploit my potential to win 
                    other Grand Slams, starting with Roland Garros where he won 
                    so many times.<br>
                    <br>
                    L'equipe: How important are Grand Slams for you?<br>
                    <br>
                    MS: Very important. It is far what is the most important for 
                    me. THe rest is nothing. For sure I want to do well in the 
                    other tournaments, but it is not to win them, it is to get 
                    confidence, to prepare those 4 Grand Slams that are really 
                    important i nthe year. Ans it is not because I didn't get 
                    good results this year that I won't play well in Roland Garros. 
                    A grand Slam is a different story, I am much more motivated. 
                    I come to Paris only to win it, just like I will go to Wimbledon 
                    to win, and to the US open to defend my title. I know how 
                    much it is hard to win this kind of tournament, but the fellings 
                    are so huge.<br>
                    <br>
                    L'equipe: Does that make you nervous?<br>
                    <br>
                    MS: No, not nervous, it is a very special feeling, very different 
                    from the ones that wed feel in the other tournaments. I want 
                    it to remain the same, in order to motivate me better, to 
                    find the right inspiration. I can't find the right word to 
                    say how much it is huge to play and to win a Grand Slam. When 
                    you are the winner, you have everything at the same time : 
                    you become famous, everybody loves you, everybody is happy, 
                    you have money, you have points, confidence, everything is 
                    great, everything is perfect. Then you have to forget a little 
                    what happened to concentrate on the next Grand Slam. So that's 
                    what is exiting for me in the life of a tennis player.<br>
                    <br>
                    L'equipe : Do you have a special feeling fot Roland Garros?<br>
                    <br>
                    MS: I love this tournament, it is my dream to win i, because 
                    clay is on what I have been raised, but also because of the 
                    atmosphere. And also there is Paris. Even if we don't know 
                    many people there, it is a city in which you have to get lost. 
                    There are so many places for it and also many things to do<br>
                    <br>
                    L'equipe : Will your family come to support you?<br>
                    MS: My parents and my sister will be there the 2nd week because 
                    Dinara is playing the juniors. I hope I will still be in at 
                    that time.<br>
                    <br>
                    L'equipe: You often say that your sister will be even better 
                    than you. Do you take care of her?<br>
                    <br>
                    MS: I don't if she will or won't be better than me, but she 
                    ha many chances to be in the top 20 or the top 10. After, 
                    that's a different story. But I don't take care of her career, 
                    she has already many people to take care of her, and it's 
                    already hard enough for me to take care of myself. <br>
