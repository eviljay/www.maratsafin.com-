                  Marat Safin - Carlos Moya (ESP) 4-6, 5-7<br>
                  An interview with: MARAT SAFIN</b><br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: Before the match started, you took about five to six 
                  minutes before starting the match. The atmosphere on court, 
                  does it affect your preparation for the match?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: No, just they called us whenever, just we were 
                  waiting for the TV and whenever TV was ready, so went out on 
                  the court and that's why it took so long. So is not our fault. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: After losing to Moya and next match you're going to 
                  meet Hewitt and Kim Clijsters won the WTA event by beating Serena 
                  Williams 2-0 today. Do you think that that will give Hewitt 
                  more motivation and how are you going to handle the next match?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: First of all, I think that I'm playing the loser 
                  of that match, Costa-Hewitt, and if I play against Hewitt, which 
                  is going to be anyway because we're in the same group, I will 
                  still be playing against Hewitt, not against Kim Clijsters and 
                  Hewitt.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: Your season obviously is going to last a bit longer 
                  than most people this year with the Davis Cup. How did you feel 
                  your form was today and are you happy with the way things are 
                  looking?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Well, for me, it's a very long season. I'm here 
                  in Shanghai and I still have three weeks to finish my year and 
                  actually is really, really long and I'm getting tired and I 
                  have no time for vacations because whenever I finish the Davis 
                  Cup, I have just 10 days of vacations and then I have to prepare 
                  myself for the next season and for me is not enough. So definitely 
                  take some weeks off during next year because otherwise -- when 
                  is too much tennis? You're getting tired and you cannot play 
                  at the same level during all the season, which is -- I think 
                  I'll have to think about my schedule for the next year and it's 
                  tiring, it's tiring because every time you have long matches, 
                  you have -- you win, you lose, but still when you lose, you're 
                  going a little bit down and then to find the motivation to come 
                  back is really difficult, especially when you have a lot of 
                  matches, which I have lately, I have been playing for so many 
                  weeks in a row and it's a tough schedule, really tough.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: You broke Moya's serve quite easily and after that, 
                  you should have confidence to hold your serve, but what's the 
                  reason that you got broken back quite easily after that?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: That's tennis. That's just -- it happens. It happens 
                  all the time when you're playing against big players, against 
                  players like Moya, and really felt like I had the match in my 
                  hands when I broke him back in the first set. I thought that's 
                  going to be it, have a big chance to come back and to win the 
                  first one and then let's see what happened in the second one, 
                  in the second set, but then unfortunately I didn't -- I had 
                  so many opportunities in the first set, I had so many opportunities 
                  in the second one and just I couldn't make them. So that's why 
                  I didn't deserve to win and unfortunately that's life.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: You talked about having just 10 days after before 
                  you start your Australian campaign. Have you given any thought 
                  to the lead-in before the Australian Open, what your schedule 
                  will hold?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I didn't get anything. Sorry, can you repeat that 
                  again?<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: Do you know what lead-in events you will be playing 
                  before the Australian Open?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: What event. Sydney. I'm playing Sydney.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: Just one match?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Hopefully not one match. Whole tournament, you 
                  know. I hope to play a few matches and get prepared. I think 
                  it's the best. My schedule for next year, I decided to play 
                  Sydney. I think it's the right tournament to prepare myself 
                  for the Australian Open and I think it's nice city also, so 
                  I'll have great time there.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: What was the difference between your semifinal win 
                  over Moya in Paris and losing to him today? What was the difference 
                  in the matches?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I don't think it's not much difference. There was 
                  also two three balls difference and here was the same thing 
                  because if I could have realised my opportunities in the first 
                  set and the second one, I should have won also in two, but unfortunately 
                  he has more opportunities in here. He was more lucky or just 
                  more, you know, like he gets his opportunities and he went for 
                  it and I have been waiting and I made a mistake. That's just 
                  two points that makes a difference. The score is 7-5, 6-4, could 
                  go the other way around, but today it went for his side, so 
                  I didn't think that I played really bad today. I had more opportunities, 
                  but wasn't -- the luck wasn't on my side. Let's put it this 
                  way.<br>
                  <br>
                  QUESTION: What are your plans after Davis Cup? That's the first 
                  question. Second question is: when are you going to look for 
                  a girlfriend?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: First question. I think I will stay at home because 
                  I'm tired of travelling. I have been travelling during all the 
                  year and for us to stay some days at home, it's more than vacations. 
                  Second question. I'm too busy with tennis. I have no time to 
                  have a girlfriend. I wish I have enough time to find one and 
                  will be great, but business is first for the moment.<br>
