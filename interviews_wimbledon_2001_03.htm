                    <br>
                    MODERATOR: Questions, please.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What happened after the second set?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No, just had a big opportunity. I was serving 
                    for the match in the third set. I missed one volley. Just 
                    afterwards everything was against me. He was making great 
                    shots. I couldn't do anything. Was like I lost completely 
                    the game in the fourth set. Then the fifth set, I just came 
                    back. That's it. Nothing special.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Did you have the impression anytime in the match you would 
                    lose it?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Of course, I have some doubts about this all 
                    the time, especially if you are not playing very well. But 
                    then you have to be focused. In the fifth set, I just had 
                    to make a break. I was lucky to make the early break. Actually, 
                    the match was almost over. <br>
                    But still, he was hitting great shots and still he was fighting.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How do you feel now with grass courts?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I don't think it's my courts, definitely, because 
                    it's very difficult to play from the baseline. You have to 
                    make some serve and volleys all the time. <br>
                    But it's okay. I'm in the third round. I'm happy.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Are you surprised to be in the second week?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Very surprised, yeah.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Do you remember how you were one week ago in your mind?<br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. I'm happy that at least I can get my confidence 
                    here. This kind of matches, you can get the confidence. Then 
                    if you playing well, you can be dangerous here.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. But are you surprised or not?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, I'm surprised in a good way.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How is your physical condition?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Okay, I think. I played ten sets in two days. 
                    Yeah, I'm okay. I still can play some more matches.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Any pains in the back?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Not much, but still I can feel it. Sometimes 
                    I have sore. But, yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Before Goran Ivanisevic say two Goran's exist, one that 
                    is calm, reasonable, another one that is completely crazy. 
                    Is that something that works also for you?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No. Ivanisevic is one guy, Safin is another guy. 
                    They has nothing to do. Nothing to compare, I think. Maybe 
                    it's because we break the racquets. But is nothing to do. 
                    Is different way of life. Different way of thinking. Completely 
                    different game. You cannot compare.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Do you feel sometimes for you, as well, there are two or 
                    three Marat's inside your body?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, I hope so. Otherwise I feel lonely.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Do you sometimes tell yourself in a match when you start 
                    smashing the racquet, &quot;Stop it now&quot;? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No. Yeah, it's difficult. It's difficult to say 
                    to yourself. You know, because there's no way, if you start 
                    to do something, you cannot stop until it's like you have 
                    a warning or you broke the racquet. Yeah, of course, sometimes 
                    it's not the best way to do it. Sometimes it's for easy mistake. 
                    I cannot find another way. I need to do something because 
                    I cannot have it inside during all the match.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Is it better to play on grass because the racquets don't 
                    break as easily?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: They break very fast, believe me, any surface. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Can you tell a few words about your next round.<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yes, Clement won, no?<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Yes. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: It's tough. The guy is very fast, very good serve 
                    for the little guy. He has very good anticipation, I don't 
                    know, very good fit. You have to be careful with him because 
                    he's a big fighter. <br>
                    But, still, I think I have a chance, you know, to win the 
                    next match. I will try to do it. I hope I will play better. 
                    I try to be there. If I have any chances, I will take them, 
                    for sure.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Do you think grass is better for him or better for you 
                    in terms of game?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I never saw him play on grass, actually. I don't 
                    know. We'll see day after tomorrow how it will go. But I don't 
                    think he's a grass court specialist - me either. Is okay. 
                    They can put us on Court 18 again, no spectators. We can make 
                    some good match like clay court style.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Going back to an earlier theme, you were discussing breaking 
                    the racquets. Can you estimate how many racquets you've broken 
                    over the years?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Many, many, many racquets. Too much. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Too many?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yes.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. If you break it down today, what made the difference between 
                    you a and David Prinosil? What made you be the winner in the 
                    end?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Two, three points. It was I think a little bit 
                    of luck maybe. I think he get scared. I think he saw that 
                    he can win, he has a chance, and he didn't take it. <br>
                    But I was also lucky, you know, in some shots. I was there. 
                    I fight for it and I win it.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Will you go and watch your sister tomorrow?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I've seen too many matches already. I spend a 
                    lot of time on the courts. I need to relax a little bit, otherwise 
                    it's too green everything. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Do you go to the centre of London sometime?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I will. I went there, yeah. I will go again.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. To do what?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: To do what? Food. What you can do there. Not 
                    many things, actually, if you know very good London.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Do you know very good?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I know it. I know it. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You said you need to relax a little bit. Do you feel you've 
                    been a bit stressed and a bit tense so far?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: If you spent in total of ten hours on the court 
                    in two days, I think is more than enough. I think it's too 
                    much, especially very close matches.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. In a more general sense, not just time on the court. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I think it's more than general. If you spend 
                    ten hours on the court, you had like very tough matches, you 
                    get tired of tennis because you can't be like hundred percent 
                    concentrated during I don't know how many hours, ten hours. 
                    I mean, you can't. You have to relax a little bit, take your 
                    time, just forget about tennis for 24 hours. Because you can't 
                    play tennis like non-stop. You go crazy.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. But you did arrive at the tournament feeling like you needed 
                    a break, feeling a little bit stressed?<br>

                    MARAT SAFIN: Not before the tournament. I was ready. Some 
                    circumstances, I had two tough matches, even first round, 
                    second round. I'm glad the guy retire. I had doubles. We save 
                    two match points. Today I had five sets, tough match. It's 
                    too much. For me it's too much. I get too stressed. <br>
