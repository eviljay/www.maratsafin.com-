                    <br>
                    <br>
                    THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You have a way of somehow playing so great and then so 
                    shaky in such a short period of time. You go up 6-2, 2-love, 
                    then all of a sudden lose six straight games. Can you figure 
                    out how you do that, go back and forth so quickly?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No, I just -- I'm not used to -- seems a long 
                    time I'm not used to play these kind of matches, you know, 
                    against these kind of players. I didn't make any good results, 
                    you, know, during all the year. And I've been injured for 
                    some reasons. Didn't play well. And of course when you play 
                    against guys like Johansson, it's tough to be focused. Because 
                    it's such a high rhythm from the baseline, you know, it's 
                    no time to think. And also you start to think, &quot;I'm playing 
                    so good. It can't be possible because it's a long time I'm 
                    not playing this well.&quot; Then you lose concentration and 
                    don't believe in yourself. Then just you lose the set very 
                    easy, you know. Then of course you have to fight and you have 
                    to find a way to beat him. Of course it's very difficult. 
                    But it's a very good example. You know, see if the first set 
                    you are playing great tennis, you still have to be focus first 
                    two, three games because it's gonna be -- they are the toughest 
                    ones. And so... But it was good. It was good to play, you 
                    know, and come back after the second set, horrible second 
                    set and play match. And I think I made -- it's a very good 
                    result for me for this year. It's unbelievable. Very good. 
                    And even I played some points like too nervous. But I am happy 
                    that is going better and better. And each time I feel more 
                    comfortable on the court, you know. The guy like Johansson, 
                    he always plays well against Russians, and especially he's 
                    playing very well in US Open. To beat him, it's really good. 
                    Very perfect. <br>
<br>
Q. What has Mats Wilander done for your game, for your approach? 
             <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Just you have to -- first of all, of course 
                    I have to work a little bit more for my concentration because 
                    it's like you have unbelievable ups and downs. You can play 
                    great, and suddenly you're playing, you don't know how to 
                    play anymore. You don't know how to hit the ball inside the 
                    court. Of course it's little bit to put pressure on the opponent 
                    since the first point of the match. You know, he has to be 
                    under pressure all the time. And try to make break, improve 
                    my serve a lot. You know, the way I served the beginning of 
                    the year was terrible. And I'm improving, and I'm just trying 
                    to play more aggressive, and, you know, and try to go to the 
                    net as many times as I can. And bring something new, because 
                    everybody know how to play from the baseline, is not enough 
                    already. Everybody's like looking for volleying, trying to 
                    make the points little bit shorter. And just pressure all 
                    the time. <br>
<br>
Q. Looking ahead to your next opponent, how do you feel your 
                    chances are with Zabaleta?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Zabaleta, I think, is very tough. Because right 
                    now he was injured at the beginning of the year, right, for 
                    six months. That's what he told me. And he is trying to come 
                    back, and he is doing well. He makes quarterfinals. For him 
                    is great result for second tournament he's playing. But last 
                    time I beat him at -- last time it was -- we played in Barcelona 
                    last year, first round, and I beat him. I think, yeah, I have 
                    a chance. Of course I have a chance. Just it will -- I will 
                    try to just start from the beginning, like focus, and not 
                    try to lose -- try to be careful with the concentration. I 
                    think I have little bit more experience. I played more matches 
                    this year, and I make some good results. And also I beat Johansson, 
                    and it's very good for me. I'm very confident. But Mariano 
                    is playing very well. It will be tough, really tough. Because 
                    he's serving well. He has a new coach, Filippini, and I think 
                    they are doing a great job together. And it's gonna be -- 
                    I have to take him very serious. Very serious. <br>
