                        This is his first Tennis Masters Series title and he is 
                        the first Russian to win here since Andrei Chesnokov,

                  <b>REPORTER:</b> Marat, I think you impressed Harel with your 
                  power and the speed of your serves. And I think you impressed 
                  a lot of people watching you in the crowd. I think Pete Sampras 
                  alluded to the fact earlier this week that you are potentially 
                  a number one player in the world some day. Are you feeling that 
                  you're getting there?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> First of all, I think the serve is very important. 
                  So if sometimes you try to serve as fast as you can to, you 
                  know, to win the point very fast. Of course, it's very risky, 
                  because normally the serve is -- when you go serving hundred 
                  per cent, full power, normally, it will go far or to the net, 
                  because there's less control. But sometimes, when you're confident, 
                  so sometimes it works.Also, I mean, what you said about Sampras? 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b><br>
                  REPORTER:</b> In an interview with Pete, Pete said that you 
                  would some day be number one or had the potential to be number 
                  one. I wonder if you today feel that is a realistic chance maybe 
                  this year?<br>
                  <b><br>
                  M. SAFIN:</b> No, actually this year I think it's impossible. 
                  Because I mean the guys like Norman, like Kuerten, they are 
                  too good. One guy won Roland Garros, and the other guy made 
                  the semifinal of Australia, final of Roland Garros. It is a 
                  big difference in the points. I mean they will not drop very 
                  easily in other tournaments. They're playing better and better 
                  each time. Just, I hope and I will be really happy to be in 
                  the top 5, it will be the best. I don't want expect for too 
                  much. Because at the beginning of the year, I didn't win one 
                  match. For me to win my match was something incredible. But 
                  now just -- at that time, like seven months ago, I set out to 
                  become top 30, top 20 player. Now I'm thinking about top 5. 
                  But number one I think I have a little bit of time, I need one 
                  or two years, you know, to be like -- I think for next year 
                  I can fight for it. When Pete and Andre will not play any more, 
                  maybe I have a chance. But we have also other guys like Norman, 
                  like Kuerten so you have start to play tennis since the first 
                  week of the year to play at a great level. Then you can talk 
                  about number one in the world. Not when you drop six months 
                  doing nothing to become number one in the world. It doesn't 
                  work like this.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER:</b> Marat, aside from the match where there was 
                  a retirement, this is the first one you've played this week 
                  that didn't go three sets. But would you say it was the first 
                  match this week?<br>
                  <b><br>
                  M. SAFIN: </b>My best match, I think was against Pete. I was 
                  completely in the match. I was from the first point until the 
                  end I tried to return. I was pretty confident of what I was 
                  doing. I was doing, I tried to return everything, I tried to 
                  run, to get all the balls so he knows that I'm going to fight 
                  until the end. So I put him -- it's more pressure, because he 
                  has to put the volley perfectly, otherwise I will get them. 
                  So I think also I returned very well and I serve, so I didn't 
                  give him a lot of chances to break me. I mean, other matches 
                  it was different, because you know, I played not my best tennis 
                  mentally, of the confidence because with Ferreira I couldn't 
                  put one volley in the third set. I didn't know what to do with 
                  the balls. I didn't -- I had eyes like this big and I was shocked. 
                  So it was just a question of be patient. First two matches was 
                  more or less the same, I didn't play well, but I waited until 
                  the other guys, they missed. More or less it was I think against 
                  Pete it was a great match. Today, I have more experience than 
                  he has, he gets a little bit nervous, sometimes he doesn't know 
                  where to go. So it was the question of experience, nothing else, 
                  because he is playing unbelievable tennis. His forehand, backhand, 
                  volley, serve, everything. But in the final, it's normal, you 
                  know, that you go to a final, you pass the quali, you play chances 
                  before, to become everybody's talking about you, in the centre 
                  of attention it's a little tough.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER:</b> Marat, apart from your great experience, would 
                  you say the dominating factor of the match today was your serve? 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> Of course the serve it gives you confidence, 
                  yes. But when he broke me in the first game, I was a little 
                  bit, "Ooh-la-la, today I'm going to fight a lot. I'm going to 
                  run." But after I break him, it was really, I knew how I had 
                  to play. And it wasn't a question of serve. I think I could 
                  play without so big serve, like over 200. But sometimes you 
                  need it, you know, to keep him under pressure all the time. 
                  But, I mean, good serve gives you confidence. It makes your 
                  game much easier. Because he knows always that if he doesn't 
                  return now, the next time will be another serve of 200 kilometres 
                  per hour. So you try to, under pressure, he knows all the time 
                  he has to be on the return, thinking about his. It is always, 
                  I need to return, I need to return. It is a little bit like 
                  this. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER:</b> Marat, now that you've won your first Masters 
                  Series title and gotten to the top 5, how satisfied are you 
                  with the progress of your game this far?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> I mean, I came here, I couldn't play tennis. 
                  You can ask Marcelo. I came here, the first day I came I practiced 
                  against him. He won. The score was 6-1, 6-2. He beat me in the 
                  practice. I didn't know where the ball was going, I didn't know 
                  how to run, I didn't know how to serve, I couldn't do anything. 
                  The problem is, not the problem -- the solution is when you're 
                  playing very bad, to become the Masters Series finalist is a 
                  small turn, it's nothing else. You don't have to work months. 
                  It's a question of one or two days, you become -- you look with 
                  other eyes at your mistakes. Because normally, when people play 
                  bad they say, I'm playing bad, I cannot play any more. Because 
                  it's a question of just two days. Just be concentrated not for 
                  hours, you can play the final for one. I didn't do anything 
                  special, I didn't eat vitamins in my life. I just, I came here, 
                  played horrible, I start to practice, I had to focus a little 
                  bit and, you know, I'm in the final. It's quite simple, a question 
                  of work.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER: </b>Marat, you seem to have much more control in 
                  your temperament than you did a year or two ago. Can you explain, 
                  please, how you have done that and what do you need to do more 
                  to get control of your game?<br>
                  <b><br>
                  M. SAFIN:</b> Control of the head or of the game?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER:</b> Head you already know, game for the future. 
                  <br>
                  <b><br>
                  M. SAFIN:</b> Definitely I have become a little bit relaxed 
                  on the court. I can control my situation. I can analyse the 
                  situation when -- if I'm losing, you know, because, of course 
                  it's very important to be relaxed on the court, be confident. 
                  Otherwise, if you get very nervous, you cannot control, you 
                  cannot hold the situation on the court when you're losing. So 
                  it's, of course, you start to miss much more. So you have to 
                  try from the beginning to be relaxed in the court. Of course, 
                  you can smash the racquet, but it's not a question. You still 
                  have to fight and try to find your game and, you know, be a 
                  little bit under control. Your head must be -- must control 
                  your body. Don't let your body do one thing and your head another 
                  thing. Otherwise there's no chance to win one match. Just have 
                  to be a little bit concentrated and try to listen, you know, 
                  what is, your mind, I think.<br>
                  <b><br>
                  REPORTER:</b> How do you do that? Do you prepare?<br>
                  <b><br>
                  M. SAFIN:</b> No, I don't prepare, I just practice for five 
                  hours. Finally, you can start to listen your mind. Otherwise, 
                  it is a question of hours, of experience, of long matches, you 
                  become much more clever and you start to realize a situation 
                  that you have to be relaxed, you have to listen to your head. 
                  What is happening, you try to calm down on the court. You try 
                  to do everything is like fighting, because otherwise everything 
                  will let calm. It's a very question of what is happening in 
                  your mind, you calm down, you fight, and everything will calm.

                  <b>REPORTER:</b> Is that the most important thing for the future, 
                  for controlling the strokes as well?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> Of course. If you control -- if you control 
                  -- mind can control the body, everything going to work. Even 
                  if you play with the left hand, the question is you have to 
                  know what you're doing, just have to be confident there. So 
                  you're confident with the strokes, with the hands, with the 
                  legs. It's much more easier, tennis.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER:</b> Marat, I just want to talk a little bit about 
                  your personality, the two sides. Sometimes you're temperamental, 
                  sometimes you're funny. And I think the crowd, I think, enjoys 
                  a show and sometimes you give them a show. And I wonder if you 
                  feel there's a little bit of the showman in you and whether 
                  the fans will see more of that in the future and whether you 
                  feel it's important to put on a show when you're out there?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> What is important how to be on the court or 
                  not? I mean, everybody on tour, you have different personalities. 
                  I mean, Hewitt, Kuerten, Norman, Sampras, Agassi, me, everybody 
                  is different. Nobody is the same. So you never have to don't 
                  -- you never have to try. At least what I do, I don't want to 
                  be, you know, to try to do something unbelievable, to show the 
                  people in a different way. I'm like this and I'm talking here 
                  like I am I am in life, like I am in normal life, because I 
                  mean if I'm working. If you feel stupid, if you want to make 
                  people think that you are clever, you are a smart guy, you know. 
                  I mean you have to behave like you are in life the easiest way. 
                  The people they are, I think the people they understand this. 
                  I hope so. <br>

                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN: </b>Yeah, because before there, it was two years 
                  ago I played the Challenger. So I get a lot of points there, 
                  I made the semifinal. So I was very close to being top 100. 
                  There it was one of my best tournaments and my best results.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER:</b> And I read this morning that you are a big 
                  soccer fan. Did you watch European Cup, in June?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> European Cup? Euro 2000, I didn't watch, because 
                  Russia, unfortunately, they're too good in football, that's 
                  why they didn't play in the final draw. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER:</b> And I was wondering, do you like parties, and 
                  are you going to throw one this evening because you won today? 
                  Are you going to have a nice big party today?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> Party? Unfortunately I have to go to Cincinnati, 
                  otherwise, I would invite you. But I have to leave to Cincinnati. 
                  After New York, I can talk about party. But now I have to be 
                  concentrating on my business.<br>
                  <b><br>
                  REPORTER:</b> How do you spend your free time? <br>
                  <b><br>
                  M. SAFIN:</b> How do I spend? I spend it at the tennis club, 
                  I spend it in the hotel, in the car and sometimes go to the 
                  cinema, but, I mean, life, this is your life. I mean, there's 
                  nothing special when I'm not doing -- many things, we cannot 
                  do it because we play a match, you have to come here, have you 
                  to eat, you stay most of the time at the club, at the site. 
                  After, if you have time, or you -- normally, you are dead after 
                  the match, so you have to be relaxed, you come to hotel, you 
                  go to eat for dinner. Then you can go to the cinema, can you 
                  have a cup of whatever you want, you can go to the bar. If you 
                  can, you can go to disco, but it's very difficult, because you 
                  get tired. If you do you spend too much time you get tired of 
                  the situation, of all this atmosphere. It's like all jobs, you 
                  get tired of everything quick. You get tired physically and 
                  mentally. So you need to relax. Sometimes you don't want to 
                  go anywhere, you just want to be in a room because this is your 
                  second house. <br>
                  <b><br>
                  REPORTER:</b> Marat, some people think you didn't do so well 
                  at the French Open. You were playing very well before, you played 
                  every week, every week, every week. For the U.S. Open, are you 
                  do anything differently so you maybe won't be quite as tired 
                  when the U.S. Open starts?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> Right question. I think I made a big mistake 
                  before Roland Garros. I played too many tournaments. But why 
                  I played too many tournaments? Because I signed before when 
                  I was 14th in the world and I had to play as many matches as 
                  I can to get my confidence back. So I cannot say when I won 
                  Barcelona, "No, thank you guys, I don't play any more here, 
                  I play the tournament, I am the best." Because if you promise, 
                  you have to play the tournament. Of course, when you won the 
                  tournament, you win something more. You win another tournament, 
                  you win another tournament, it's not possible. So what happen, 
                  at the final in Hamburg, I played Duseldorff, I was completely 
                  dead. I played four matches and I came to Roland Garros, okay. 
                  I played four sets, five sets, another five sets. I had to play 
                  Magnus Norman, I couldn't play, my legs were exhaust. I hope 
                  I will not do it this year, I have to be a little bit clever. 
                  But it's going in the same situation, I know, it's a big same 
                  mistake. Same situation, but I will try to have less people 
                  around me it's better. You don't have to make a lot of people, 
                  you don't have to give attention to everybody. I will try to 
                  be a smaller family and be only with them. I know that some 
                  people, they don't understand this because they want to talk 
                  to you, they want to be friends with you. But for our job, it's 
                  a little bit difficult because you get tight in the head, you 
                  can't play. So it's small family, I go U.S. Open. And after 
                  we'll see.<br>
                  <b><br>
                  REPORTER:</b> I have a question regarding your coaching situation. 
                  Why did you split with Chesnokov and will Volkov become your 
                  permanent coach for the future? <br>
                  <b><br>
                  M. SAFIN:</b> With Andrei Chesnokov, what happened was one small 
                  misunderstanding. We're still friends and I don't want to lose 
                  him like a friend. For me it's more important. With Alexander, 
                  I don't want to lose him as a friend. So that's why we're not 
                  working together. Also he has a business in Russia. With Cherkasov, 
                  also I don't want to lose him as a friend. So it's a little 
                  bit difficult situation. But, I mean, it's more important that 
                  you have friends. So I have to look for a coach for a serious 
                  guy -- I don't know, normal coach, professional coach.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>REPORTER: </b>Do you have someone in mind?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> No, I don't want to think about this, because 
                  when you start think, you go crazy. I have to play. I can play 
                  alone, of course with the help of Alexander. But, I mean, I 
                  will think about this after the U.S. Open. For me it's more 
                  than important these tournaments and conclude the U.S. Open. 
                  So after then I can think and choose.<br>
                  <b><br>
                  REPORTER:</b> During the match I noticed that you were talking 
                  a lot to yourself. What do you tell yourself in order to get 
                  your focus back?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> What?<br>

                  <b><br>
                  REPORTER:</b> Yeah. I was wondering what you tell yourself to 
                  get your concentration or your focus back. <br>
                  <br>
                  <b>M. SAFIN:</b> Not many good things I tell myself normally. 
                  So normally I talk when I miss the ball and when I'm making 
                  easy mistakes. But it's not a question of confidence. You try 
                  to explain to yourself that you are stupid, that you don't have 
                  to do like this next time. But I think it's not normally, the 
                  concentration you get from other point. But normally, when you 
                  talk to yourself, you say, "I love you, you're a good guy, but 
                  don't miss next time, okay." More or less like this. In other 
                  words. <br>
