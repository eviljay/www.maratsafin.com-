                    Q. It looked like a tough game. What was happening on court? 
                    <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, he played I think well. He's a tough player 
                    with these conditions - small court, crowd, a little bit of 
                    wind. His game is perfect to play with such conditions. He 
                    served quite well, very good volleys. But at the end I think 
                    the key was in the third set, 7-6, I won the tiebreak. From 
                    there, you know, I felt a little bit more of confidence, that 
                    I could return the serve and I could do a little bit more 
                    on his serve. It's very difficult, very difficult to play 
                    against these kind of guys.<br>
<br>
Q. It looked like at certain points you were getting emotional, 
                    a little angry. In the third set, it looked like you were 
                    channeling your anger, really put it to use. Is that what 
                    you do? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I was a little bit frustrated because I had 
                    my chances, I couldn't just realize them. I was quite disappointed. 
                    But then I calmed down and I just, you know, start to play 
                    better, I start to have some more confidence. That helped 
                    me. <br>
<br>
Q. Are you satisfied with your game on the clay? You're one 
                    of the players that doesn't matter of the surface, no? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Especially now is difficult to play on clay 
                    and win easy matches because everybody's playing quite well. 
                    They have very good game to play on any surface. Every match 
                    you win, you have to be happy. You have to say thanks that 
                    you passed the round because everybody can give you trouble. 
              <br>
<br>
Q. You're coming back from a back injury, a pinched nerve. 
                    At times it looked like you were rubbing. Is that giving you 
                    problems?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I couldn't really serve for two sets, I think. 
                    I didn't really serve hard. I played with a second serve. 
                    But then I decided because I have to push a little bit more 
                    with the serve. But I was a little bit scared. That's why 
                    I just didn't really serve well for the first two sets, and 
                    then I start to serve well and my game came up.<br>
<br>
Q. Do you think it's going to be a problem in upcoming matches?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I hope not. I have to check my back after each 
                    match and see how it's going. Just I hope it will be okay 
                    in a few days.<br>
<br>
Q. Is it continued good your relation with Marc Rosset?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. I think before to start to work with somebody, 
                    you have to know each other much better. So he needs time, 
                    I need time to get to know him better so we can do something 
                    big.<br>
<br>
Q. You're No. 1 in the Champions Race now. You look at that? 
                    Does it matter the ranking so much for you?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No, I don't really. You have to look at the 
                    ranking the end of the year. During the year it's a lot of 
                    changes. Every time somebody is doing something big, the ranking 
                    is changing very fast. I think you have to check your game 
                    first and be careful with injuries, you know, just try to 
                    be focused, try to be stable for all the year and be consistent. 
                    Then the ranking is going to be okay because the ranking is 
                    coming with your game. <br>
<br>
Q. You look like you've improved in this consistency. Final 
                    in Melbourne, final in Masters Series.<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I didn't lose one first round this year, so 
                    it's quite good. I'm doing well. I'm trying to be focused, 
                    trying to be consistent. That's main thing. I think in the 
                    long run, it's going to help me.<br>
<br>
Q. How much is important Davis Cup for you? Yevgeny say it 
                    the most important thing for him this year. Maybe if he wins 
                    the Davis Cup, he would like to retire. Is important for you? 
                    Are you going to help him?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I am far from retiring. But it's very important 
                    for us, yes, yes, it is, because we never won. We've been 
                    twice in the finals, '95 and '96. It would be great if we 
                    can win this year. It's quite difficult because still we are 
                    favorites against Argentina, but also the finals, it's tough. 
                    If France win, we're playing here in Roland Garros. I don't 
                    think we have a lot of chances. But if we beat Argentina, 
                    we play against the States, then I think we are favorites 
                    because we will play at home with our crowd and probably we're 
                    going to win. <br>
<br>
Q. In France Wednesday is a day off in school. There were 
                    a lot of kids today. <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I could notice it.<br>
<br>
Q. Kind of noisy audience. What do you think?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Kids are kids. You cannot blame them. They're 
                    coming, they're having fun, you know, just shouting on the 
                    crowd. Is also good. Is good entertainment for them because 
                    they're future of your country, so they have to do something. 
                    They're playing tennis, they like football. They do different 
                    things, they have to be busy. I think if the people are coming, 
                    they're enjoying to watching tennis, I think it's very good. 
                    They're coming, a lot of them. It's good entertainment for 
                    them. I'm happy.<br>
<br>
Q. You have to play Olivier Rochus in the second round. Do 
                    you know him? What do you know about his game?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I know him quite well. He's one year younger 
                    than me. I know him since I was 14. Very good player. He beat 
                    me once two years ago. Actually, it was last year in the beginning 
                    of the year. It was three sets in the Hopman Cup on the hard 
                    courts. He's a small guy, but he's very talented, very good 
                    hands, very fast, very good anticipation. He's dangerous on 
                    clay. He's always dangerous.<br>
<br>
Q. What do you have to take care of?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Just play your game. I think my game is good 
                    enough to beat him. It's going to be difficult, but still 
                    I have to manage to find my game - you know, play confident, 
                    try to build the points, serve, everything. <br>
<br>
Q. A question related to the crowd. When you're down, you 
                    hear the crowd chanting your opponent's name, you're playing 
                    against a French guy, how distracting is that?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: It's the same thing happens in Russia. They 
                    supporting me in Russia. It's normal they support the French 
                    player. It would be strange if they support me. I think it's 
                    logical and it's okay. I think I can survive. It's just a 
                    game. You get pissed, you know, with your game, with all the 
                    things around you. But I think it's okay. Just a game anyway. 
                    You don't have to make such a big deal out of it. <br>
                <br>
