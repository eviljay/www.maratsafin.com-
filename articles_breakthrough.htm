                  By L. Jon Wertheim<br>

                  <i>HELP WANTED: Tempestuous Top 5 tennis player seeks full-time 
                  coach to accompany him on circuit. Experience preferred. Must 
                  be able to moonlight as sports psychologist. Flexible hours. 
                  Competitive $$.</i><br>
                  <br>
                  If you're interested in the above position, fax your rйsumй 
                  and references to the ATP Tour, attention: Marat Safin. The 
                  20-year-old Russian, currently the No. 4 player in the world, 
                  may be tearing up the tennis circuit, but since April he has 
                  been unable to retain a full-time coach, relying instead on 
                  an assortment of temps. "I'm starting to take it personally," 
                  Safin says of the unfilled position. "Maybe nobody loves me."<br>
                  <br>
                  That's hardly the case -- and not just because Safin's walk-into-a-net-post-gorgeous 
                  girlfriend, Silvia, is usually on his arm when he's not on the 
                  court. As Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi, now 29 and 30 respectively, 
                  enter their sunset years and gradually relinquish the baton, 
                  Safin is emerging as the leading young light in men's tennis. 
                  The centerpiece of the ATP Tour's cheeky NEW BALLS PLEASE ad 
                  campaign, which tacitly acknowledges that the sport is desperate 
                  for a transfusion, Safin is a star for the new millennium. He's 
                  tall, dark and handsome; he speaks three languages (Russian, 
                  Spanish and English in descending order of fluency); and he's 
                  disarmingly candid. Not surprisingly, he's fast becoming a fan 
                  favorite. Playing in the RCA Championships in Indianapolis last 
                  week, Safin was mobbed for autographs and photos at every turn. 
                  "I only sign for beautiful girls," he joked before obliging 
                  Hoosiers of all shapes and sizes. <br>
                  <br>
                  Unlike another young, photogenic Russian tennis player featured 
                  in the pages of this magazine (Anna Kournikova, who a decade 
                  ago trained with Safin in Moscow), he has the results to justify 
                  the hype. The proprietor of a 133-mph serve and unmatched all-court 
                  skills, Safin has won three tournaments and more than $1.2 million 
                  in prize money this year. Though he has never advanced beyond 
                  the quarterfinals of a Grand Slam event, his stamina and heat-seeking 
                  baseline missiles place him on the shortlist of viable contenders 
                  to win the wide-open U.S. Open, which commences on Monday.<br>
                  <br>
                  Regardless of how he fares at Flushing Meadows, the consensus 
                  on tour is that Safin is a future No. 1. "He's only 20, he's 
                  a big, strong guy, and he's got all the tools," Sampras said 
                  after Safin defeated him en route to winning last month's Toronto 
                  Masters Series event. "Being Number 1 and staying there is a 
                  whole new ball game, but he's got the potential to do that."<br>
                  <br>
                  Adds fellow Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who had a brief tenancy 
                  in the rankings penthouse last year: "Marat is so talented, 
                  he will be as good as he wants to be." <br>
                  <br>
                  Such benedictions would have been unthinkable earlier this year, 
                  when Safin played so poorly and with such little passion that 
                  he contemplated retirement. In the first round of the Australian 
                  Open, he lost to little-known Grant Stafford of South Africa 
                  after an effort so desultory that he was docked $2,000 for tanking. 
                  (That," says Safin of the fine, "was bulls---.") By late April, 
                  Safin had won only five matches in 12 tournaments. "Confidence 
                  is so funny," he says, pointing to his head. "It's not coming, 
                  not coming, not coming, and you say, 'I have no chance of beating 
                  anybody.' You just have to hope it returns. When it does, then 
                  you feel no one should beat you."<br>
                  <br>
                  His personal perestroika, as it were, has come at a price. Before 
                  the Open Seat Godo 2000, in Barcelona in April, Safin parted 
                  ways with his longtime coach, Rafael Mensua. They had been together 
                  since Safin was 13 and Mensua took him from Moscow to Valencia, 
                  Spain, to train year-round. "We were -- we still are -- like 
                  a father and son," Safin says, "but it was heading to the point 
                  where I would say, 'Ah, f--- you,' and he would say, 'Ah f--- 
                  you,' and we might never talk again. Both of us needed a change." 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  With Mensua no longer in his box, Safin won the title in Barcelona, 
                  took the trophy in the Mallorca Open the next week and reached 
                  the finals of the Hamburg Masters Series event two weeks later, 
                  losing in a fifth-set tiebreaker to Gustavo Kuerten. Andrei 
                  Chesnokov, a former Top 10 player, worked with Safin in the 
                  spring before returning to his family in Moscow. Veteran coach 
                  Tony Pickard punched the clock during the grass-court season, 
                  including Wimbledon. Former pro Alexander Volkov has been with 
                  Safin during the summer hard-court stretch but will return home 
                  to Russia after the U.S. Open. Given Safin's recent success, 
                  does he need a full-time coach? "I'm not disciplined enough," 
                  he says. "I get bored too easily."<br>
                  <br>
                  On the court, certainly, he often has a hard time sustaining 
                  his focus. Safin plays a high-risk style of tennis, sizing up 
                  the lines and wasting little time massaging a point. When he's 
                  on, he plays breathtakingly well, blending power with style 
                  and grace. In his first match in Indianapolis, against Israel's 
                  Harel Levy, Safin offered a tasting menu of his skills, smoking 
                  winners from the baseline, pounding aces and knocking off clever 
                  stab volleys.<br>
                  <br>
                  Yet when his radar is off a bit, the results can be disastrous. 
                  Earlier this month in Cincinnati, for instance, he overhit relentlessly 
                  and lost in straight sets to France's Fabrice Santoro, a markedly 
                  inferior player. "Sometimes he's out of control," Volkov says 
                  of Safin. "In that match I thought he was going to have a heart 
                  attack." <br>
                  <br>
                  When Safin is having a rough day, he often takes out his frustrations 
                  on his Head graphite rackets. He claims that last year he cracked 
                  48 of his implements, and he is on a similar pace this year. 
                  Fortunately for Safin, the ATP Tour has relaxed its rules on 
                  racket abuse, on the grounds that it promotes "color" among 
                  the players. "That's the way it should be," Safin says. "I'm 
                  not like [the preternaturally poised] Stefan Edberg; I'm not 
                  a robot. I'm an individual who gets mad. If I break a racket, 
                  who does it really hurt?" <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin reckons that he gets his, um, exuberant personality from 
                  his father, Misha, a director at a municipal tennis club in 
                  Moscow. (Marat's mother, Rausa Islanova, a tennis coach, trains 
                  his 14-year-old sister, Dinara, a highly regarded junior.) But 
                  if Safin's temper is of the hair-trigger variety, he is equally 
                  quick with a one-liner. After Safin outlasted Sampras in Toronto, 
                  a reporter congratulated him on having played an excellent tiebreaker 
                  in the third set. "For you, maybe it was good," Safin responded. 
                  "For me, I lost 10 years of my life." <br>
                  <br>
                  Last week he was asked if he had designs on emulating Kournikova 
                  and emigrating soon to the U.S. "Oh, so you want me to kill 
                  myself?" responded Safin, who recently bought an apartment in 
                  Monte Carlo. "They don't even let me drink a beer in this country." 
                  Then there's the matter of that coaching vacancy. "I can't understand 
                  it," Safin says with mock earnestness. "You get to spend 24 
                  hours a day around me. That should be hard to resist, shouldn't 
                  it?" <br>
