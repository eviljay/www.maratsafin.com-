                  Source: Independent - London <br>
                  Publication date: 2001-06-17<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The placatory moves by Wimbledon designed to take the heat out 
                  of the controversy over their seeding for next week's Championships 
                  have done nothing to calm down Marat Safin, the world No 2 and 
                  US Open champion. Safin is rapidly emerging as the leading critic 
                  of the situation, replacing Andrei Medvedev, who famously savaged 
                  the tournament three years ago, hastening so many changes in 
                  arrangements for the competitors that Medvedev is now an enthusiast 
                  of the event. <br>
                  <br>
                  But Safin, rumbling away at the French Open in Paris a couple 
                  of weeks ago about Wimbledon's seeding procedure, is not assuaged 
                  by the announcement that in future there will be 32 seeds at 
                  all the Grand Slams, beginning next week at the All England 
                  Club. Tomorrow we will know exactly how Wimbledon have juggled 
                  the positions of the leading 32 in the ATP and WTA official 
                  rankings to take account of their ability on grass.<br>
                  <br>
                  What particularly needles the 21-year-old Muscovite (now a resident 
                  of Monte Carlo, as befits his high tax status) is that Gustavo 
                  Kuerten, the reigning world champion, winner of the French title 
                  at Roland Garros a week ago and by some distance the current 
                  world No 1, would probably not have been top seed for Wimbledon. 
                  Even though that has been rendered academic by Kuerten's decision 
                  to rest his aching body and bypass the grass-court season, Safin 
                  is incensed that Wimbledon may not seed exactly according to 
                  the rankings, as the other three Grand Slams do.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I can never understand why they choose to make the seedings 
                  themselves,&quot; said the Russian yesterday. &quot;For me, 
                  their way will never be the proper way. There are so many things 
                  I don't understand about Wimbledon's attitude. It has to change, 
                  things can't go on like this.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;They are nice to those who can play on grass and not nice 
                  to those who can't. Wimbledon will never be as special as the 
                  other Grand Slams, Roland Garros, the US Open and Australia. 
                  I love Paris because they treat everybody perfect, the atmosphere 
                  is great. We have juniors sitting in the locker room alongside 
                  us, it is very nice for them and us.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin's antipathy to Wimbledon was not eased when his coach, 
                  Mats Wilander, was refused permission to walk through the grounds 
                  by security personnel last week. Wilander, a former world No 
                  1 and winner of seven Grand Slam championships - but not Wimbledon 
                  - had gone to the All England Club to check out the dressing 
                  room facilities and was refused permission to take a short cut 
                  out of the club to get to Southfields Underground station. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;They wouldn't let him in sight of the Centre Court,&quot; 
                  said Safin. &quot;They made him walk another kilometre around 
                  the stadium. `Sorry, you can't go in,' they told him.&quot; 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The kindly explanation, of course, may be that Wilander, a quiet 
                  and modest champion, did not press his case or wave his arms. 
                  Or that the security personnel did not recognise who they were 
                  barring. After, all the 36-year-old Swede won his last Grand 
                  Slam at the 1988 US Open. <br>
                  <br>
                  But the snub has only reinforced Safin's prejudice against the 
                  tournament. &quot;Wimbledon could be much nicer to people,&quot; 
                  he insisted. &quot;That's my opinion and I will keep it until 
                  something changes. I don't care if I am allocated only one ground 
                  pass for saying these things or whether they give me 10. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;If Kuerten went to Wimbledon as world No 1, some guy sitting 
                  in an office would tell him he can't be No 1 there. We have 
                  used the rankings system on the ATP tour for years, yet Wimbledon 
                  have to be different. If they changed their attitude no one 
                  would tell Wimbledon they weren't playing there. Then everyone 
                  would be happy.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;It doesn't matter to me that Pete Sampras has won Wimbledon 
                  seven times. If he is rated at No 4 in the rankings he should 
                  be seeded fourth at Wimbledon this year. He was seeded according 
                  to his ranking at the French Open, yet he can't play on clay, 
                  so why should clay- court players be discriminated against by 
                  Wimbledon? I think I have more options to play on grass than 
                  Sampras has on clay.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  Then the impish side of Safin's character, which he can never 
                  subdue for long, surfaced as he grinned, &quot;Everyone knows 
                  how to play on grass but it is one thing to know and another 
                  to actually play&quot;. Perhaps grass- court tennis will help 
                  to reduce the incidence of broken rackets which have littered 
                  Safin's path to the top. &quot;On grass they only bounce,&quot; 
                  he said. He also saves money when they bounce, since Wilander 
                  has introduced a fine of $100 per broken racket.<br>
