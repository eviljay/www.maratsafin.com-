                  Marat Safin - Juan Ignacio Chela (ARG) 6-4, 6-3. <br>
                  AN INTERVIEW WITH: MARAT SAFIN</b><br>
                  <br>
                  TOUR OFFICIAL: Okay. Marat improves to 35 and 14 on the season 
                  and he remains perfect in Toronto with a 7 -0 match record. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Okay. Questions for Marat?<br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: How do you think you played out there today? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I think I played -- I played great. I played the 
                  -- the match service, good serve. Especially it is very difficult 
                  to play after a long vacation that I had in Moscow so I am satisfied 
                  with my game. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: What were you actually doing in Moscow? What will 
                  you be doing with your time off? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Everything except tennis. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: How long for?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: For two weeks. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: Marat, do you -- do you have any good feelings coming 
                  back to Toronto after winning here two years ago?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yes. Yes. Yes. Feeling good. I know Russian people 
                  live here -- around 150,000 -- so I feel right at home. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: And do you feel fresher and more healthier than you 
                  were at the French Open and Wimbeldon?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah I needed -- I needed - I needed a break because 
                  like already I ... (Inaudible) ... Tired at the French Open. 
                  I was -- like it's difficult. I couldn't find the motivation. 
                  I was tired and I was tired a little bit of tennis mentally 
                  and physically and Wimbledon was horrible. I mean I played bad 
                  and I had no motivation. I couldn't fight -- I couldn't fight 
                  and I was feeling bad and I needed that break. Just for few 
                  weeks I was -- I didn't see a racket. I didn't see a ball. I 
                  didn't want to and -- but I was afraid if I would -- I would 
                  come back, you know, because I had such great vacations and 
                  I was enjoying so much so it's come back to work it's real difficult 
                  but eventually I had to do it and I'm feeling good, and I'm 
                  feeling fresh, I'm feeling motivated and I want to play tennis 
                  and I'm playing okay. I'm happy. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: When was the last time you felt this good? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: A long time ago. I think any time when you're making 
                  your break you're feeling much better because you need this. 
                  It's difficult to play great tennis throughout the year because 
                  you're getting tired because you're playing long matches, a 
                  lot of stress, and every day is a routine for you. It's like 
                  hotel and then to go to club and from club you go to the hotel 
                  and it's difficult. It's difficult to live this life a long 
                  time so that's why you need like half a year and just take vacations 
                  like a few weeks and then you start again the second part of 
                  the year and I think you need this. You need definitely because 
                  without this you can't play tennis. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: You talked about the lifestyle of being a tennis player. 
                  Is that the kind of advice that you give your sister? Is there 
                  any advice that you have given her? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: What do you mean? Again. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: Preparations for your sister as far as her playing 
                  on the tennis scene. What kind of advice have you given her 
                  as far as hotel to tennis court to training?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: You cannot compare Russian -- you cannot compare 
                  women's tennis to the men's tennis. It is a complete different 
                  mentality so it's -- it's a different story so I don't think 
                  she has to listen to me. She has to listen to the coach who 
                  has been involved with long time in women's tennis. I think 
                  he knows what -- what she has to do and she should listen to 
                  him. Not to me. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: You're back with Amit Noar now or you're always with 
                  him or you're changing always? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Always. Always. Always. Always.<br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: For the next ten years?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: You never know. I don't know what's going to happen 
                  tomorrow. You're asking me what's going to happen in ten years. 
                  I hope I will be okay tomorrow. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: And Guga and Pavel in the second round is pretty tough?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Very tough. Very tough. Even if Kuerten is not 
                  in his best shape he is always dangerous. He can play great 
                  tennis. He knows how to do it and also Pavel, you know, because 
                  he is motivated because he is defending champion from last year 
                  and he wants to make good here so it's very tough second round 
                  but it's the way it is. I mean you have to go through this -- 
                  go through the matches if you want to win -- to win the tournament 
                  you have to take a couple of really tough ones. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: Are you a bigger star in Moscow than ever before? 
                  Are you a bigger star than Federov or Anna?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: What means a star? What are you talking about? 
                  I mean like a -- . <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: You know when you walk in the street everybody says 
                  &quot;Hello Marat. You know, &quot;We want your autograph.&quot; 
                  the girls like you? No? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: No. No. No. No. I'm feeling great. I'm feeling 
                  good. Perfect. Like not everybody recognize me. I don't walk 
                  in the street because I am having fun. Really good. <br>
                  <br>
                  TOUR OFFICIAL: Any other questions? We're done. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: (Questions asked in Russian). <br>
                  <br>
                  TOUR OFFICIAL: Thank you. <br>
