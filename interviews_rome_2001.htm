                    4-6, 6-4, 7-6<br>
                    An Interview With: MARAT SAFIN<br>
                    <br>
                    THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. In an ideal world, would you play that second set again?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I would play?<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Replay the second set. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, because I think I played okay the first 
                    set, and by the second set I had big chances to finish the 
                    match like 2 and 3, 2 and 2. Just I let him play and just 
                    came back. And the problem, that was the problem, that I let 
                    him play in the second set, so he thought that he has a big 
                    chance. <br>
                    In the third set, of course, it was a little bit different, 
                    different story, and it was a little bit tough to win this 
                    match.<br>
                    But if I would have the same opportunity to play, it would 
                    be great.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. I know you practiced together before, right, yourself and 
                    Roger? But this was the first match you've had. Was there 
                    an element there that you were both very determined to show 
                    whatever one could do, you could do better and this sort of 
                    thing? Because you're both young players who were waiting 
                    to become rivals for a long time.<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but with any way, with all my respect to 
                    Roger and all these things, I think I am -- you can't compare. 
                    But I mean we have completely different -- I think I won more 
                    tournaments than him, I have more experience than him. Sorry, 
                    but you cannot compare us.<br>
                    Of course we are -- he is one year younger, but still, I have 
                    more experience. I already won one Grand Slam title and I 
                    have more titles.<br>
                    The problem is that because I know how to play against him, 
                    and I made everything is possible to make -- I try to make 
                    the second break in the first set, so already I don't let 
                    him play. But I couldn't do anything, so it was 6-4.<br>
                    Then second set, I wanted to make an early break and try to 
                    hold the serve. I made it, but I was a little bit unlucky 
                    because I didn't serve for actually one month and a half, 
                    I lost it.<br>
                    So I think I have more experience. If I would be -- if it 
                    would be match in two weeks, from here to Roland Garros, I 
                    think I would have more chances. I don't think he would have 
                    so many chances like today.<br>
                    I would not let him play for sure. It would not be for sure 
                    the third set. No chance. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How much are you concerned about your shoulder and how 
                    much treatment are you having now?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: It's not the shoulder. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Beg your pardon. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Who cares, no? (Laughing.)<br>
                    No, I think I get -- I'm okay. I'm starting okay. But still 
                    I have no -- I didn't serve for a long time so still my serve, 
                    sometimes I make double-faults which was just ridiculous.<br>
                    But I think is the reason, I didn't serve for at least for 
                    one month and a half, since Dubai I couldn't serve. So sometimes 
                    when I get shaky, I can't serve.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Has the pain gone?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No, it's perfect. It's okay. I'm very satisfied 
                    with it, the injury. I'm okay now. At least I have to -- I 
                    can come back, I have two more weeks to prepare for Roland 
                    Garros. I think I will be okay.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Since when have you been able to practice?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I start to practice like backhand, forehand without 
                    any problems two weeks ago. And the serve, I just serve my 
                    first time I serve was on Friday before the tournament.<br>
                    So I mean also it was -- the way I'm serving now, it's okay. 
                    But anyway, it's not -- I'm satisfied the way I'm playing. 
                    For the first two days is, I think is great. But of course 
                    you get disappointed because when you are losing to somebody, 
                    7-6 in the third especially, it hurts.<br>
                    But with the help of Mats, with the help of my friends, it 
                    will be great and I'll try to make this year -- at least do 
                    something big here -- do something big.<br>
                    Because I think everybody's waiting something from me, but 
                    for some reasons I can't do it right now because of the injuries. 
                    You have to get back, get used to play long matches, the fitness. 
                    So many things. I think I have two weeks, I'll be okay for 
                    Roland Garros. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How has the association with Mats Wilander gone so far? 
                    I mean, have you seen each other a lot recently?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Successful. I won my first match with him yesterday, 
                    and I think is gonna be okay. He is coming for -- to Hamburg. 
                    He will stay with me until Roland Garros. And just keep working 
                    and just...<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. At the moment he's still playing on the Senior Tour, isn't 
                    he?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, is also. He wants to play some tournaments 
                    by himself. That was a agreement. And I'm satisfied. So he's 
                    coming Friday, Saturday, to Hamburg, and we'll work hard and 
                    try to do something. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Towards the end of the match you looked pretty tired physically. 
                    How much have you been able to do? Have you been able to do 
                    any fitness during your injury? Nothing or...?<br>
                    </font><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: But it's still what you doing in the fitness, 
                    you have to use to play matches. I mean, you can't come and 
                    -- after the injury for one month and a half, I wouldn't be 
                    able to do anything for one month, and last two weeks I start 
                    to do something.<br>
                    I come here and try to win the tournament, it's little bit 
                    ridiculous. It's little bit -- I mean, the guys who are here 
                    are playing unbelievable tennis for already one month, I think, 
                    on clay. Then coming from an injury, trying to beat everybody 
                    who's in the draw, I think it's little bit stupid.<br>
                    So at least one, two rounds, I had a big opportunity today. 
                    But anyway, I was unlucky today but I'm satisfied. I need 
                    few weeks to adjust, get used to playing, and I'll be okay 
                    physically and technically, whatever.<br>
                    Q. The fact that most of the big players have lost, is that 
                    because it's at the beginning of the preparation phase for 
                    Roland Garros? Is it too early in the preparation phase for 
                    Roland Garros?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No, if the people they lose here, it's because 
                    they are -- I mean, the other people are better than them. 
                    I think it's one of the biggest tournaments on the Tour, this 
                    tournament, and everybody wants to win.<br>
                    I don't think it's -- nobody wants to make prisons of like 
                    points, money. I don't think it's the reason. I mean, everybody 
                    want to win here. If they lose, it's because they are not 
                    in the best shape.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Did you break any racquets today?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Nothing, no. Not yet.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What's your feeling about the seedings controversy at Wimbledon?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I mean, if I want to get involve in all this 
                    things, I don't actually need to get involve. I don't care 
                    if I'm seeded or not. For me, maximum that I made was second 
                    round. <br>
                    Of course if I want to make something bigger, of course it 
                    matters, and I think it's -- my opinion is that I think if 
                    the rules are -- I mean, rules are rules. We're playing in 
                    the same ATP all Grand Slam titles, all Grand Slam - Australian 
                    Open, Roland Garros, US Open, they respect. Why Wimbledon 
                    they really don't have to respect?<br>
                    I mean it's a little bit -- sorry, but is not correct for 
                    the players and those things. I don't think it's correct. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Would you play if they altered the --?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: If I am not seeded? If I will play if I'm not 
                    seeded?<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Yes.<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I have to play. Look at my results. The beginning 
                    of the year, I didn't make any good results. And also I've 
                    been injured, so I have to play anyway.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You would play anyway?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Anyway. But next year if I play a little bit 
                    better in the beginning of the year, I will think about this. 
                    <br>
                    I mean, because if there's some people, they trying to make 
                    some good results to get seeded in Wimbledon, and the people, 
                    they think that's not good enough to play on grass, just...(whistling) 
                    Just... It's something that is not correct, but nice. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. But even if, say, a lot of the members of the Players Council 
                    on the ATP say, &quot;We don't agree with what Wimbledon is 
                    doing and we think there should be a boycott,&quot; say it 
                    got to that stage. As Kuerten has said, if they don't seed 
                    according to the 16 on the entry system, you know, it's not 
                    right, even if they change a little bit from that. Would you 
                    still play anyway this year?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I mean the Council... But, it's just a big mess. 
                    I mean if we start now to discuss about these things, it's 
                    gonna be ATP involved, the Lawn Tennis Association I think 
                    is gonna be involved and gonna be big mess if I say something 
                    wrong now. <br>
                    It's not nice to do all these things to these players, and 
                    they have to do something else. They have to respect us. I 
                    mean, we are running 365 days a year, trying to get the points 
                    for Wimbledon to get seeded in Wimbledon, and it's coming 
                    there and you are not seeded? Well, you say, &quot;For what 
                    I'm playing tennis?&quot;<br>
                    I mean, the people who doesn't know - probably no idea - some 
                    of them have no idea about tennis, they have to decide if 
                    I am -- if I have to be seeded or not. I think it's not correct.<br>
                    And I want to say it's my opinion. And I don't want to get 
                    in any polemics or anything. I think it's just my version. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. But you're willing to play --?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I think this is better.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. But you are going to play?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I will play. Play, play. I am seeded I think. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What do you think about the fact that your sister is playing 
                    well here in Italy and she's playing well in general?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, she -- I think she won tournament here 
                    last month and she's playing good tournament. So I'm happy 
                    for her. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Do you follow her?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No. No. The results, but...<br>
                    <br>
