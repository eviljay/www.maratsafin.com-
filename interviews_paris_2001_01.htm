                  M. SAFIN - A. Vinciguerra 4-6, 4-6<br>
                  An interview with: MARAT SAFIN</b> <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. You have a pretty bad record against him. Was it the same 
                  as usual? Was it something very different today? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: No, I think it's just -- just played too many weeks 
                  and I'm already a little bit tired. So it's the last tournament 
                  of the year, and I tried to make good. <br>
                  But I play like six weeks in a row. So one month and a half. 
                  Just normal fitness and I'm tired mentally. I'm just -- I couldn't 
                  anymore. One of these matches that's just finish the year. I'm 
                  too tired. Too much time on the tennis court. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. But your wins didn't give you the confidence? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, confidence. But I lost. You know, every time, 
                  especially in Russia, you don't get tired. You get tired physically 
                  because you have to give everything there, and also mentally.<br>
                  Because a lot of people comes. You know, you have to make press, 
                  you have to make it. So there's a lot of people. Of course it's 
                  Russia, so you get twice more attention than normal tournaments. 
                  Too many people, too much going on around us. I just couldn't 
                  any more, just I couldn't handle it anymore.<br>
                  Today, everything was just mad. I couldn't. Mentally I'm tired. 
                  That's the thing. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. What are you going to do for the next two months? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: No, I need to relax for like -- I need to take 
                  holidays because I had really strange year. I had the problems 
                  with my back. Then I couldn't recover. I couldn't make any good 
                  results. <br>
                  I start to change racquets. Just at the end, in August, I start 
                  to play well since US Open. So it's for three months I play 
                  this year. Now another six months I try to find my game, try 
                  to find my racquets, just try to recover from my injury. <br>
                  So it's just quite strange and bad year. So it's just I need 
                  to prepare myself for next year to, you know, try to be in the 
                  Top 5. That's my goal. This year, anyway, I couldn't make Masters 
                  because Grosjean has been playing well. I had no chance. <br>
                  And also, it just is not the goal for me to stay No. 10, No. 
                  7 or even No. 6. For me the goal is to be in Top 5. Otherwise, 
                  is not interesting for me. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Was it a little bit strange to be in Court No. 1 as a titleholder 
                  in Paris? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. Of course can get pissed with everybody. 
                  But I always played well here. I make final, I won the tournament. 
                  I think they could make -- I think the tournament, they could 
                  make, you know, they could put me in the center court. <br>
                  I think I deserve it. I always played well. I make everybody 
                  happy here. And to put me on Court 1, it's completely different. 
                  The lights are different. So I cannot see when it's not enough 
                  lights. I don't see very well.<br>
                  Of course it's sad. But anyways, I don't blame anybody. It's 
                  my fault that I lost. It's okay. I mean, I am satisfied that 
                  I am playing, that I won two tournaments this year, even playing 
                  bad. So...<br>
                  But I'm happy also that the year is finished. I'm just -- I'm 
                  done for this year. I can't give any more. I just -- I give 
                  up today, but just I couldn't handle it anymore. So that's life, 
                  and sometimes it happens. <br>
                  You cannot do nothing against this kind of things when you are 
                  tired. And you can't anymore. You can't -- I couldn't try and 
                  I couldn't just -- I was dead. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. You were supposed to have a meeting with Mats in Paris. Can 
                  you tell us a little bit about that. <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yes, we will have a chat maybe now, in half an 
                  hour, or tomorrow morning. So we have to discuss, of course, 
                  things for next year and all these things. So for the moment, 
                  I didn't want to make -- I didn't want to talk to him before 
                  'cause I was still in the draw, I'm still playing, I'm still 
                  fighting for Sydney. But now is finished. I have to organize 
                  everything for next year. So...<br>
                  Today or tomorrow I will know my future. <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. What's your opinion at this time? You'd like to go on? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: You will hear for sure. I don't know, we have to 
                  talk. It's just I cannot -- with respect to Mats, I cannot say. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. May I ask you, though, are you happy with the way it went? 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, yeah. But, yeah, yeah. I would like to improve 
                  something. I think we both know. So that's why it's important 
                  to sit and to talk and to talk openly. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. What is it about playing Vinciguerra? He's beaten you four 
                  times now. Why is he so hard to play against?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: No, he's not so hard to play. Of course, yes. But 
                  also the time he beat me, it was like he beat me last year or 
                  the beginning of the year. I couldn't put the ball inside the 
                  court. Today, just I was dead. <br>
                  So I think if I am ready, if I am motivated, if I am fit, I 
                  think I have more chance to beat him than he can beat me. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. How disappointed are you, given that you haven't defended 
                  your title and you've fallen out of the race for Sydney? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: That's okay. It's okay that I didn't defend my 
                  title. It's okay that I didn't -- I don't go to Sydney. Because 
                  I don't know, like I said, I don't want to go No. 8, the last 
                  one who catch the train. For me, it doesn't make sense.<br>
                  No, you can -- you know, people can give some opinions, all 
                  the guys talking. But I think I deserve something more. I deserve 
                  to -- I have enough game, you know, I have a good coach. My 
                  goal is to be in the Top 5, like I said before. And I think 
                  that's my goal. <br>
                  It's not the goal to, you know, to qualify in the last moment 
                  in the Masters and to finish the year No. 8. Of course it's 
                  good, to finish the year 8. But it doesn't give me too much 
                  motivation. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Just a couple questions about the start of next year. I understand 
                  you're going back to play in Auckland. <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Uh-huh. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. You're obviously looking forward to playing there again. 
                  You've played there before. Your reasons for going back to that 
                  tournament? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Well, because for me, I like New Zealand. I've 
                  been to Auckland in '99. It was a great place. It's -- of course 
                  it's a little bit windy in courts. But it's perfect. It's relaxing 
                  tournament. You can play, you can practice, you can have fun. 
                  It's good to play.<br>
                  Because Sydney, I wasn't really successful. I don't feel comfortable 
                  playing on those courts. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. You think it's a good buildup for the Australian Open?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, it's good preparation I think. It's great 
                  preparation for the first tournament of the year. For the Australian 
                  Open, I think it's the best. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Did you learn anything this season, and do you know what 
                  you need to change next season to do even better? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I know beginning of the season, I mean, it was 
                  -- you cannot learn, but I was injured for two months. I didn't 
                  play at all, and I couldn't get -- I couldn't find my game. 
                  It's -- of course, yeah, I understood that -- I learned that 
                  you have to be careful with the injuries. <br>
                  Just to start the year from the beginning 'cause also to make 
                  -- of course I need to make preparation before the season. Otherwise, 
                  my muscles are little bit fragile. I need to work little bit 
                  harder on my muscles, and I can prepare for next year.<br>
                  I think it's okay if I start the year well. I think I have a 
                  big chance to be in the Top 3, Top 5. I think I have big chance. 
                  <br>
