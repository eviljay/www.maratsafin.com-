                    <br>
                    <br>
                    THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. This tournament, for you, is beginning to look suspiciously 
                    like last year. Start a little slow, get better. By the second 
                    week you were rolling.<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I hope it's -- it will go the same way. Because 
                    I'm feeling quite well. I played today much better than last 
                    two matches. I mean, it's very difficult place to win. It's 
                    all these days and it's very difficult to make unbelievable 
                    tennis.<br>
                    But still, I make some good shots and I'm there in the match 
                    and I'm playing quite well.<br>
                    Second week, I'm gonna be dangerous for sure. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. I don't know whether you meant it to sound like it did, 
                    but earlier in the week one got the impression that, &quot;I'm 
                    here, happy to be here, hope I do well. If I don't, dig deeper.&quot; 
                    I wonder now whether or not your motivation is getting stronger. 
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Of course, because you know, the beginning of 
                    a tournament is 128 players and everybody wants to win, you 
                    know. Now it's only last 16 players so it's getting closer 
                    and closer and I have more chances to win. Every time it's 
                    less, less persons playing tennis.<br>
                    And the way I'm playing, I'm quite sure and I'm quite confident 
                    in myself and I feel every match I am playing I know that 
                    the next match is gonna be quarterfinals. And then quarterfinals, 
                    you never know.<br>
                    So it's everything is there. And it's -- I have very good 
                    motivation right now. Unbelievable. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Although you have to get past Johansson. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Rusedski's out of here now, and your half of the draw is 
                    beginning to look very comfortable. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. Is nice to hear, but still, Johansson is 
                    tough. But I'm playing well, so it's -- I'm confident in myself. 
                    It's definitely-- I have a big chance to beat him. And I think 
                    -- I feel comfortable in the court. Depends on me all the 
                    time. I hope it's-- everything gonna depend on me, every match, 
                    every point, every set. I'm not depending on anybody, any 
                    player. I depend on myself. The way I'm playing, the way I'm 
                    gonna win. And if I play bad, I still have a chance to win. 
                    If I play good, I mean, the other guy has no chance.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Have you played Thomas before? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, I played twice. (Inaudible). I beat him 
                    in Dubai where I get injured. I got injured against him in 
                    the first set. But I don't know how I won this match. Then 
                    I played next week in Indian Wells. I was injured. I couldn't 
                    serve, so it was 6-4, 6-4. But still, I think is gonna be 
                    very interesting match.<br>
                    But I'm telling you, I'm gonna be very, very dangerous. Very 
                    dangerous.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. He's a very streaky player. When he's hot, he's unbelievably 
                    hot. Then sometimes it just goes cold.<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but when I play good, it's nobody has a 
                    chance also. When I'm play well, it's no chance to beat me. 
                    So, I hope I'm gonna be the same like I played today or even 
                    better, and it's gonna be very tough to beat me. He has to 
                    play very good tennis to beat me, definitely. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. In the bottom half of your draw, Rafter, Agassi, Sampras, 
                    Federer. At some point all these great players are going to 
                    have to play each other in very emotional matches to reach 
                    the semifinal. Do you think it's possible that if you get 
                    there, whoever survives is going to be a little bit emotionally 
                    drained from all those tough matches? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but still I have Johansson. Other parts 
                    of the draw, who is there, Malisse, Zabaleta. Who is there? 
                    Malisse, Zabaleta. <br>
                    These guys, I lost to Malisse. I mean, not playing well, but 
                    still I lost to him. So I have to give little bit respect 
                    to these guys still.<br>
                    But of course somehow you start to think about the semifinal 
                    and it's very nice, you know, if you think about semifinal, 
                    it means that you are confident with yourself. But still I 
                    am going match by match. You know, I have Johansson. If I 
                    win, I can think about quarterfinals and semifinals. That's 
                    for sure, I am closer.<br>
                    But it's difficult. I cannot say, &quot;Yeah, I'm gonna be 
                    in semifinal.&quot; If I'm not in semifinal, you gonna give 
                    me so much shit in the press conference, so I have to be quiet, 
                    you know.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. But now in the bottom half, in your opinion, in a tournament 
                    of this magnitude, bigness, whoever survives out of these 
                    great players, is he likely to come through stronger at the 
                    end of emotionally drained? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I think it depends what matches. It depends who 
                    gonna be there. Of course if somebody gonna -- if Pete or 
                    Andre or Patrick or Federer gonna get into a semifinal, definitely 
                    they will have a lot of confidence and they will feel unbelievable 
                    comfortable on the court. But still, you know, they played. 
                    They gonna have two tough matches. You know, it's very close.<br>
                    And I hope they are tired and I hope they are not playing 
                    well, all these things. But I cannot say. It's gonna be very 
                    tough for sure. Because whoever gets to the semifinals is 
                    gonna be very confident and really tough to play, definitely. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Very frightening. When you came here to New York, did you 
                    think it would be possible to win consecutive US Opens, as 
                    Rafter has done? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Is still, you know, first of all, you don't believe 
                    in yourself. You just come here and I'm playing okay. But 
                    still I am not 100 percent. I am still not happy what I am 
                    doing. I'm not happy the way I am playing, you know. Suddenly, 
                    you start to think, &quot;Why not?&quot; I start the same 
                    way last year. You know, the first two rounds was horrible. 
                    I played horrible tennis. I almost lost to Pozzi, I almost 
                    lost to Grosjean.<br>
                    Now I am in Round of 16. I am playing much better. I think 
                    I have a chance to win. Why not? Every time I'm more confident 
                    and I have more confidence. Every time I go to the court I 
                    feel more comfortable. And I'm still there. Definitely I want 
                    to win. If I have a small chance to win, I'm gonna take it 
                    for sure. For sure. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. The public's general perception of Marat Safin is, &quot;He 
                    has everything you need to be dominant, but we're still not 
                    sure about what's up here. We know he can hit the ball, great 
                    serve, hits off the ground great, he can volley. But we're 
                    not quite sure about what's up here.&quot; Is that fair? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I mean, yes. But everybody is struggling, you 
                    know. Ones they struggle, they don't show any emotions on 
                    the court, but they still have so many things in his head 
                    that he cannot play tennis anymore, you know. And of course 
                    I have something to improve, right? If I have nothing to improve, 
                    I'm gonna be the best tennis player in the world for next 
                    ten years. So it's at least it's good to have something to 
                    improve. That's why I have Wilander with me, so he puts my 
                    head in the same place it was last year. So... But I'm working. 
                    I'm working on myself. <br>
