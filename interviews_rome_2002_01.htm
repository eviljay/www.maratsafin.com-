                  6-2, 6-2<br>
                  An Interview With: MARAT SAFIN</b> <br>
                  <br>
                  THE MODERATOR: First question for Marat, please. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. You must be pleased by that kind of win today? Your opponent 
                  was quite dangerous on clay. You won pretty easily.<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, I played really good today. I was surprised. 
                  I was impressed by myself that I can play so good - especially 
                  here. <br>
                  Because the courts are very, very fast so it's -- the clay is 
                  quite fast, so it's easier for me to play here. And for him 
                  it's more difficult because he's more player for the very slow 
                  clay court. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. How much does it change when the courts are so fast, 30%? 
                  How much is the difference between it for you? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I don't know how much the percent, but it's -- 
                  for me, it's easier to play on hardcourt. So basically it's 
                  also very, very fast clay. So with my serve, and also I return 
                  quite well, so it's very difficult for the guys like him to 
                  play and play fast, the way I'm playing. So that's make the 
                  difference. <br>
                  If it would be very slow, the courts, then it's going to be 
                  tough match and maybe three sets with him. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. You played a few good matches in Monte-Carlo. Even if you 
                  lost to Moya, it was a very good match. What did you do since 
                  then, between Monte-Carlo and here? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I had a few days of vacations because I've been 
                  playing for a long tournament like five weeks in a row. So, 
                  for me, it's very difficult. And I've been holidays, then practice.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. How much practice? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Basically it was physical conditions. Because for 
                  clay, you need definitely to be very prepared physically. Now 
                  you have Rome, Hamburg and Dusseldorf and two weeks of French 
                  Open. So you have to be really good prepared. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. For the clay season everybody's looking to Ferrero and then 
                  maybe Hewitt because he's No. 1 in the world. At which level 
                  do you put Mr. Safin? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I think I can play with all these guys, especially 
                  I'm just -- I'm still No. 6 in the world. I'm going up and up. 
                  I started year 11, now I'm 6. I'm not defending anything until 
                  basically the US Open where I make semifinals, and I am full 
                  of confidence and I'm gonna be dangerous on clay - very dangerous.<br>
                  I think -- but I prefer to stay like this or that nobody will 
                  take me serious or I will not have too much pressure on myself. 
                  I just play my matches, I win my matches, and I'm getting closer 
                  and closer to No. 1. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. You seem thinner. Have you lost some weight? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: No, I gained some weight. I gained 2 and a half 
                  kilos. Usually my weight is 92, 93 kilos. Now I'm 94 and a half. 
                  So thank you for the compliment (smiling).<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Must be muscles. <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Thank you. Thank you for the compliment (smiling). 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. You seem much more focused on your tennis this year than 
                  last year. Is it an impression? Is it true? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Thank you for another compliment. <br>
                  No, just... I have to be serious. I mean, now I have -- but 
                  last year was a little bit difficult because I've been injured 
                  for two months so I lost Monte-Carlo, I lost Rome, I lost Hamburg 
                  and I couldn't find my confidence back. And I have some - my 
                  personal problems.<br>
                  So basically it was -- the year wasn't so great and I could 
                  finish 11, so is not so bad. And this year I'm playing great. 
                  I start the year very well - finals in Australia. <br>
                  And I'm quite solid, so I'm not losing easy matches. Just I 
                  am there quarterfinals. But the problem is I cannot make - like 
                  - get over the quarterfinals.<br>
                  But I'm playing well. I'm satisfied. I am confident. I think 
                  Rome, Hamburg I will have to do something special, just be prepared 
                  for the Open. But I think I have a chance there, definitely. 
                  The way I'm playing right now, big chance. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Looking back to the final at the Australian Open, what can 
                  you say about that match? Was it you missed a chance? Was it 
                  the wrong day? Was it an incredible experience? Was it the experience 
                  of your life? What? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I think, like I said, I mean, it's -- (inaudible) 
                  just give the explanations. Because actually it's true that 
                  I've been taking antibiotics two days before the tournament 
                  starts. So basically I've been taking antibiotics for six days. 
                  Eventually, I could make -- of course I could make the finals. 
                  <br>
                  But also when I played, it was the time when I played. It was 
                  late, or it was with the roof so I could run. Suddenly, with 
                  the sun, especially what happened with the match with Haas, 
                  we start to play with the sun, it was very hot and just I couldn't 
                  run. Then they close the roof and the score was 6-love, 6-2. 
                  And the finals, of course.<br>
                  But definitely I think part of it, Thomas played a really good 
                  match and just I lost my -- I lost my game after first set. 
                  That was the key. I couldn't stop him. I tried, but he was too 
                  good. So it's a great experience for me - not really nice to 
                  lose the final on my birthday, but still it's nice. We cannot 
                  change it. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. You were very kind in Australia to invite some of us to your 
                  party with the blonde &quot;Safinette.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Can you answer me one question, how many times 
                  you gonna repeat the same question (laughter)? Because it's 
                  already past five months and everybody's asking the same question. 
                  I have done so many good things afterwards. I think we can talk 
                  about tennis, not my private life. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Any private life in Rome? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: No, I don't think so. I am here to play tennis 
                  and to answer your questions and do my job, and my object is 
                  to finish this year No. 1. And if you have some questions about 
                  the subject, I will answer it with pleasure.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. What do you have to do to become No. 1? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: What do I have to do? Just stay focus, play the 
                  way I'm playing, work hard. I mean, it doesn't take so much 
                  time. And just stay focus, stay -- never give up. And especially 
                  with the help that I'm having right now, Marc Rosset is helping 
                  me this moment. He's trying to help me. And we're doing well, 
                  you know. Already like three weeks together, he's just assistant 
                  coach, and we're doing well. We're doing well.<br>
                  So I hope that this year I could finish No. 1. It would be a 
                  great present for me. <br>
