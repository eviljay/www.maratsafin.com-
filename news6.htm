                        Guillermo Canas upset No. 2 Marat Safin 7-5, 6-3 Friday 
                        to advance to the semifinals of the $2.95 million Tennis 
                        Masters Canada.<br>
                        Safin, who won this tournament two years ago, became the 
                        favorite when No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt lost in the first round 
                        Monday at the National Tennis Centre at York University.<br>
                        The first set was seemingly heading towards a tie-break 
                        with Safin serving at 5-6, but Canas put in a clever drop 
                        shot to take a break and the set. <br>
                        In searing temperatures, Safin began to lose control of 
                        his game and temper, arguing calls and slamming his racket 
                        into the court when Canas recorded an early break in the 
                        second set. <br>
                        That gave the Argentine a 3-1 lead and he never looked 
                        back.<br>
                        It's so pathetic,&quot; said a disappointed Safin. &quot;I'm 
                        laughing at myself for how badly I played.&quot; <br>
                        Safin made 19 unforced errors in the first set. The 22-year-old 
                        Russian grew more angry during the match, cursing and 
                        raising his racket as if to slam it to the court.<br>

                        No. 2 seed Marat Safin dropped a set, but avoided the 
                        third round upset by defeating Chile's Marcelo Rios, 3-6, 
                        6-3, 7-6 (3).<br>
&quot;He used to be No. 1 in the world, and for me 
                          he's the most talented player in the world,&quot; Safin 
                          said. &quot;He's very dangerous. Today he was playing 
                          great and was very close to beating me.&quot;<br>
Safin, the winner in Toronto in 2000, fought back from 
                          a 4-1 deficit in the third set to secure a fourth quarterfinal 
                          appearance in a Masters Series event this year after 
                          previously reaching the quarters in Miami and Monte 
                          Carlo and the final in Hamburg.<br>
&quot;I was completely lost in the second set, when 
                          he was a break up,&quot; the 22-year-old Russian said. 
                          &quot;I thought it was the end. Then I came back but 
                          was down 1-4 again in the third set. I just kept fighting 
                          and tried to stay in the match. With him you have to 
                          hold your serve and wait for him to make mistakes.&quot;<br>
Safin must now face Guillermo Canas, who has already 
                          devoured No. 10 seed Roger Federer and No. 5 Yevgeny 
                          Kafelnikov this week in Toronto. &quot;He's playing 
                          great tennis right now,&quot; Safin said. &quot;I saw 
                          him today, and he played great tennis. But I also think 
                          Yevgeny was tired after two tough matches against Mirnyi 
                          and El Aynaoui and the doubles.&quot;<br>

                        Toronto, Canada</b><br>
                        If it was a game between two champions, Marat Safin paid 
                        no mind. Ancient history, said Safin, is just that. The 
                        Russian star dispatched defending champion Andrei Pavel 
                        of Romania 6-3, 7-6 (4) in the second round of the $2.95-million 
                        US Tennis Masters Canada tournament Wednesday, to advance 
                        to the round of 16.<br>
                        Safin won the 2000 tournament in Toronto before going 
                        on to win the US Open later that summer. Pavel won the 
                        Tennis Masters Canada last summer in Montreal.<br>
                        &quot;It is already history, two years and one year ago, 
                        it's already in the past,&quot; said Safin, the No. 2 
                        seed and the favourite to win this week after top-seeded 
                        Lleyton Hewitt of Australia was upset by Felix Mantilla 
                        of Spain on Monday. &quot;You're coming here to win it 
                        again, and to win the tournament. It doesn't matter against 
                        who you're playing, you just go for it.&quot;<br>
                        The six-foot-four Safin, who has yet to add to his 10 
                        career titles this season, went up 5-0 in the first set 
                        before the Romanian replied with his blistering serve. 
                        <br>
                        &quot;He was serving first and second serve like 220 kilometres 
                        per hour. What do you want me to do?&quot; Safin said, 
                        chuckling. &quot;It's like, 'Good luck.' &quot;<br>
                        In the tie-breaker, though, at 3-3, Safin's serve hit 
                        Pavel in the face, and seemed to throw the Romanian off-guard. 
                        Pavel managed just one point after that.<br>
                        &quot;In a tie-breaker, you basically need to serve first 
                        serve because it's important,&quot; said Safin. &quot;At 
                        3-3, you're a little bit nervous so just serve strong 
                        to the body and let's see what happens. It's very difficult 
                        to play it.<br>
                        &quot;The serve saved my ass in the tie-breaker,&quot; 
                        he added, laughing.<br>
                        Safin plays the winner of Wednesday night's game between 
                        Carlos Moya of Spain and Chile's Marcelo Rios. <br>
                        ------------------<br>
                        In the first round doubles, duo Yevgeny Kafelnikov/Marat 
                        Safin lost to R. Federer/W. Ferreira 5-7, 1-6.<br>

                        Russian second seed Marat Safin opened his hardcourt campaign 
                        with 6-4, 6-3 win over Argentine Juan Ignacio Chela on 
                        Tuesday, leading a parade of grand-slam winners into the 
                        second round of the Canada Tennis Masters. <br>
                        Joining the 2000 U.S. Open champion in the next round 
                        were former-French Open winners Carlos Moya and Yevgeny 
                        Kafelnikov. <br>
But former-Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek, three-time 
                          French winner Gustavo Kuerten and current Roland Garros 
                          champion and sixth seed Albert Costa failed to join 
                          them, all stumbling out at the first hurdle. <br>
A busy day of action at the US$2.9 million tournament 
                          will conclude late in the evening with Pete Sampras, 
                          the greatest grand slam winner ever with 13 crowns, 
                          taking on South African Wayne Ferreira. <br>
Back in action for the first time since a second-round 
                          loss at Wimbledon, a well-rested Safin faced a difficult 
                          opening assignment against the 25th ranked Chela. <br>
But the big Russian, who sits No. 2 in the Champions 
                          race standings, was always in command and claimed early 
                          breaks in both sets. <br>
&quot;I thing I played great,&quot; said Safin, the 
                          highest remaining seed following world number one Lleyton 
                          Hewitt's first-round upset on Monday. &quot;Especially 
                          since it was difficult to play after a long vacation 
                          I had in Moscow.&quot; <br>
&quot;I needed a break. I was tired, tired of tennis 
                          mentally and physically and Wimbledon was horrible. 
                     <br>
&quot;I had such a great vacation, I was enjoying it 
                          so much coming back to work is real difficult. <br>
&quot;Now I'm feeling refreshed, I feel motivated and 
                          playing good tennis.&quot; <br>
Safin can expect a much sterner test in the second 
                          round, where he will face defending champion Andrei

                        for this year's men's singles title, has lost dramatic

                        Marat Safin, the Russian who is occupying his highest 
                        seeding place at Wimbledon as second seed, came through 
                        the first round without difficulties against the 1997 
                        runner-up, Cedric Pioline of France. Safin, the US Open 
                        Champion, won their match on No.1 Court , 7-6 (9-7), 6-2, 
                        6-3. <br>
This was an important win for Safin who is appearing 
                          at The Championships for the fourth time. Last year 
                          he reached the quarter-finals, where he was beaten by 
                          the eventual winner, Goran Ivanisevic. Pioline,who turned 
                          33 earlier this month, has been playing at Wimbledon 
                          since 1991 and is more than comfortable on grass.<br>
The match reached an early climax in the first set 
                          tie-break when Pioline held one set point which Safin 
                          saved with a brave volley. Then Safin took the tie-break 
                          on his third set point.<br>
&quot;It was a very difficult first round for me,&quot; 
                          Safin said after the match, &quot;The courts are new 
                          and it's a little bit difficult for me to start here 
                          and to play well, especially because you are nervous, 
                          you have a big opponent, Pioline, and it's difficult 
                          to play.<br>
&quot;I think I played well for the first round. I 
                          served well. I had some good volleys. Baseline was working 
                          very good. So I'm satisfied.&quot;<br>

                        6-4 on Saturday to win the Liverpool international exhibition 
                        tournament. <br>
Safin, the No. 2 ranked player, did not drop his serve 
                          throughout the match. The former U.S. Open champion 
                          narrowly got the better of the first tiebreak, but two 
                          double-faults in the second gave Gambill the chance 
                          to get even. <br>
But Safin broke Gambill's serve in the seventh game 
                          of the decisive set, the only break in the match, and 
                          went on to win.<br>

                        Marat Safin beat American Scott Humphries 7-6 (4), 5-7, 
                        6-3 in the Liverpool International Wednesday to virtually 
                        seal his place in the semifinals of the round-robin exhibition. 
                       <br>
Safin took the first set on a tight tiebreak but paid 
                          the price for failing to convert three break point chances 
                          in the seventh game of the second set and was broken 
                          himself in the 11th. <br>
But he broke Humphries in the fourth game of the final 
                          set and wrapped up the win. <br>
&quot;I am enjoying it in Liverpool and being guaranteed

Safin clearly enjoyed himself during his 7-6 3-6 7-6

It was the Russian's first match since his defeat in

Safin said: &quot;I don't think grass is my speciality

                        Marat Safin accepted his French Open semi-final defeat 
                        like a good sport. &quot;I wasn't good enough, that is 
                        it. It is just another day and that is how it is. You 
                        have to accept this,&quot; he said after his 6-3 6-2 6-4 
                        defeat at the hands of Spain's Juan Carlos Ferrero.<br>
                          &quot;Of course it is tough but it is life and that's 
                          how it is. You have to be tough and get on with it,&quot; 
                          he said. &quot;Okay I was nearly in the final here, 
                          I was nearly winning the tournament... But from this 
                          point to winning the title, it is like the distance 
                          from here to the moon.&quot;
                          <br>
                          The 22-year-old, runner-up in the Australian Open at 
                          the start of the year and U.S. Open champion in 2000 
                          said he did not know if he would win a major again, 
                          but was not concerned that he was coming up short in 
                          the prime of his career.<br>
&quot;I don't know if I am going to win a big one again, 
                          who can know?&quot; he asked. &quot;But I just want 
                          to play my tennis and enjoy it. If I win again, if that 
                          moment ever comes again, then that will be marvellous. 
                          I would love that, but who knows, who can tell?&quot;<br>
Safin, the second seed at Roland Garros never got into 
                          the match as Ferrero reached his first grand slam final 
                          after losing in the semi-finals here on his previous 
                          two visits in 2000 and 2001.
                          <br>
                          &quot;The guy was just better than me. I tried to find 
                          my game but he was too good... I couldn't do much and 
                          that is why the score was 6-3 6-2 6-4. Pretty easy, 
                          huh? Even when I had a break in the first set he played 
                          much better. The guy knows how to play. He has learned 
                          a lot and is very dangerous... I tried to move him around 
                          but the guy was everywhere. He is fast and has great 
                          shots -- I couldn't find a solution to beat him.&quot;<br>
Safin said Ferrero was unrecognisable from the 14-year-old 
                          he practised with eight years ago. &quot;He played completely 
                          different as a kid,&quot; Safin smiled. &quot;He was 
                          making lobs all the time and never missing a ball... 
                          just getting it back. Now he is attacking all the time... 
                          It's impressive how you can change your game like that.&quot;<br>
Safin's next goal is to reclaim the number one ranking 
                          he held in 2000. &quot;If I can stay solid this year, 
                          make my results without rushing anything then I think 
                          I can become number one,&quot; he said. &quot;This, 
                          I think, is my goal.&quot;<br>

                        One extra day of rest couldn't help Sebastien Grosjean 
                        recuperate from his marathon efforts this past 10 days, 
                        the Frenchman falling in straight sets to No2 Marat Safin 
                        on Thursday.<br>
                        In Thursday's match, both players required the assistance 
                        of the trainer, Safin even before the match had started! 
                        The Russian was treated for blisters on his right foot, 
                        while Grosjean needed help with his groin problems. <br>
Nevertheless, it was Safin who seemed less bothered 
                          by his ailment, the No2 seed playing uninhibited tennis 
                          and powerfully directing the rallies. It became quickly 
                          clear that there would be no French miracle. More so 
                          than earlier in the tournament, Grosjean's groin seemed 
                          to affect him, and he moved less freely around the court. 
                     <br>
Safin broke for the first time in the eighth game, 
                          surging to a 5-3 lead. He went on to take the set in 
                          the following game, after 31 minutes of play, and having 
                          only dropped four points on serve. <br>
Grosjean was clearly suffering and called for the trainer. 
                          A couple of minutes later, he went back on court, to 
                          attempt to reverse his fortunes. Yet, more so than in 
                          the first set, he looked anxious and restrained in his 
                          movements, making him vulnerable to Safin's aggressive 
                          attacks. <br>
                        In the third game of the second set, Grosjean went up 
                        40-0. But Safin kept the pressure on, bouncing back to 
                        break for a 3-1 lead. He went on to break again, and take 
                        the set 6-2. Grosjean had been treated again at 2-5 down 
                        and thereafter never looked like coming back. Safin secured 
                        victory in one hour, 43 minutes.<br>
&quot;I played quite well. I played smart. I tried 
                          to stay calm and play my game,&quot; said Safin, who 
                          now faces No11 Juan Carlos Ferrero. &quot;You can never 
                          be satisfied with your game. You always want to do better. 
                          But I played well enough to reach the semifinals and 
                          to have a chance to go to the final,&quot; he added. 
                       <br>
Safin, who grew up in Spain, is the only foreigner 
                          in the semis (there are three Spaniards - Costa, Corretj 
                          and Ferrero). He trained in Valencia since he was 14-years-old, 
                          near the place where Ferrero was raised.<br>
&quot;I know the Spanish players quite well. They are 
                          the biggest fighters in the world. They have a very 
                          good baseline game, and they never miss a shot. I know 
                          I will have to put Ferrero under pressure. You definitely 
                          need a good serve and try to look for the net. To stay 
                          with him. To try to stay calm.... I know his game, he 
                          knows my game. I always play well against him. I like 
                          his game. I feel comfortable against him.&quot; <br>

                        Marat Safin has his mental fragility exposed in his four

                        6-3 6-3 3-6 6-4. The big Russian spent the first two sets 
                        imposing his monstrous first serve and lethal groundstrokes 
                        onto his shell-shocked opponent, but then self-combusted 
                        in the third set when Nalbanian tightened his game, cut 
                        down on his errors and cranked a handful of winners.<br>
                        &quot;The first two sets was great tennis, I think, then 
                        I lost my game,&quot; said Safin. &quot;I had my match 
                        in my hands the fourth set, 3-0. Just try to make 4-0. 
                        But I just missed everything and I was a break down in 
                        the fourth.&quot;<br>
                        The Argentine frustrated the volatile Russian with a brilliant 
                        display of shotmaking late in the third set, wearing the 
                        big man down by taking risks on the big points. Safin's 
                        body language told the story, the third seed hanging his 
                        head and waving his arms furiously.<br>
                        &quot;I start to play his game, and that's why I start 
                        to have problems, and that's why I lost my game,&quot; 
                        summed up the Russian. &quot;My game is just to, you know, 
                        make the point shorter, try to look for the net.<br>

                        &quot;You try to hang in there. But it's difficult. The 
                        other guy is feeling this, and he's playing much better 
                        because he has more confidence the way the match is going.&quot;<br>
                        Safin later admitted that he was happy the majority of 
                        his performance today. &quot;Was a great fight. I'm satisfied

                        Victory tasted delightfully dirty to Marat Safin today. 
                        The second-seeded Safin had endured a five-set struggle 
                        that spanned more than three hours against Olivier Rochus, 
                        the Mighty Mouse of tennis whose small stature is offset 
                        by a huge heart, when Safin race to the net behind a bluff 
                        of an approach shot. <br>
As Rochus drilled a forehand pass, Safin made a desperate 
                          dive and somehow delivered a backhand drop volley winner 
                          as he fell face first onto the red clay court. When 
                          Safin arose, his shirt was covered with clay, his teeth 
                          were streaked with traces of the dirt, and he wore the 
                          wide grin of a winner who was savoring the taste of 
                          a hard-fought 4-6, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3 second-round triumph.<br>
At 5-feet-5 inches tall, Rochus, whose childhood ambition 
                          in life was &quot;to be tall&quot;, would almost need 
                          a step ladder to give the 6-foot-4 Safin a high five. 
                          But the Belgian took the court knowing victory was well 
                          within his reach. In their lone career meeting, Rochus 
                          registered a 6-2, 1-6, 6-3 victory over Safin at the 
                          2001 Hopman Cup on hard court. Throughout his career, 
                          Safin has been susceptible to defeat against small players 
                          who cover the court quickly and can take the pace off 
                          the ball, which can create errors from the hard-hitting 
                          Russian.<br>
A year ago, Frenchman Fabrice Santoro played all the 
                          angles in dismissing the second-seeded Safin from the 
                          second round of Roland Garros with a 6-4, 6-4, 4-6, 
                          0-6, 6-1 victory. It was Santoro's sixth win in seven 
                          matches against Safin and while Rochus is not quite 
                          as skilled as changing the pace and playing the angles 
                          as Santoro, his play proved problematic at the outset 
                          as he captured the first set.<br>
A pinched nerve in Safin's back forced him to withdraw 
                          from his World Team Cup match on Saturday, but the injury 
                          didn't appear to hamper Safin's serve as much in the 
                          decisive set today as he slammed seven of his 15 aces 
                          and produced 15 winners in the final set to move into 
                          the third round.<br>
The 22-year-old Safin enjoys a favorable draw with 
                          29th-seeded Argentine David Nalbandian awaiting as his 
                          third round opponent.<br>

                        Second seeded Marat Safin had to contend with a determined 
                        French wildcard and a very vocal crowd before winning 
                        through to the second round at Roland Garros, Wednesday 
                        afternoon.<br>
The big-serving Russian finally dominated his opponent, 
                          the feisty wildcard Mikael Llodra, closing out the match 
                          6-4 2-6 7-6(7) 6-4 in two hours, 48 minutes.<br>
22-year-old Llodra, a flashy and extremely talented 
                          lefthander whose style is often compared to the great 
                          Henri Leconte, nevertheless challenged the big Russian 
                          today.<br>
A quarterfinalist in Delray Beach earlier this year 
                          - where he took Andy Roddick to three sets - Llodra 
                          had also played and won his first Davis Cup match last 
                          month (in doubles with countryman Fabrice Santoro). 
                       <br>
In the first set, Safin - who withdrew from the World 
                          Team Championships in Dьsseldorf last week with a pinched 
                          nerve in his back - played way below his best tennis. 
                          The Russian was forced to wait until the tenth game 
                          before breaking for the first time and capturing the 
                          set from the uninhibited Frenchman. <br>
&quot;I couldn't really serve for two sets, I think. 
                          I didn't really serve hard. I played with a second serve,&quot; 
                          said Safin of the niggling injury. &quot;But then I 
                          decided because I have to push a little bit more with 
                          the serve. But I was a little bit scared.&quot;<br>
In the second set and with the crowd behind him, Llodra 
                          raised his level, pounding winner after winner from 
                          all over the court. Taking chances on every ball, he 
                          smothered Safin, and after 29 minutes had levelled the 
                          match at one set apiece.<br>
&quot;He played I think well,&quot; said Safin. &quot;He's 
                          a tough player with these conditions - small court, 
                          crowd, a little bit of wind. His game is perfect to 
                          play with such conditions.&quot;<br>
Suffering from a bad bout of blisters, the second seed 
                          forced a tiebreak in the third set, but then missed 
                          his first three set points, sending the fans into a 
                          frenzy. Llodra double-faulted to hand him the set. &quot;From 
                          there, you know, I felt a little bit more of confidence, 
                          that I could return the serve and I could do a little 
                          bit more on his serve,&quot; said the Russian.<br>
Safin surged ahead in the fourth to stand at 5-3. Llodra 
                          broke back with a magnificent passing shot but was unable 
                          to capitalise on his comeback, the Russian thumping 
                          two passing shots in to take the match.<br>
                        Safin will play Belgium's Olivier Rochus, straight sets 
                        winner over Attila Savolt, in the second round.<br>

                        Marat Safin said he wasn't sure if he'd be fit for the

                        The Russian withdrew with a back injury when trailing 
                        3-0 in the third set against Jose Acasuso of Argentina, 
                        and said he'd have more treatment before making a final 
                        decision.<br>
With 
                        the French Open starting on Monday, the withdrawal was 
                        hardly the preparation Safin would have wished for, and 
                        he admitted that his back must improve if he's to have 
                        a chance in Paris.<br>
                          &quot;I am going to the hospital to check my back,&quot; 
                          he said afterwards. &quot;I have two days to recover. 
                          I will see if I can play next week. It must be quite 
                          bad if I retired. <br>

                          I can. I will try to see if I can do something over 
                          the next few days. <br>
                          Safin, who had played well all week in Dusseldorf, looked 
                          good again as he raced through the first set 6-2 against 
                          Acasuso.<br>
                          However, as his opponent grew in confidence, Safin began 
                          to get rattled and the Argentine took advantage to level 
                          the match at one set apiece.<br>
                          Acasuso then broke for 2-0 in the third, before Safin 
                          then had treatment on his back, before finally calling 
                          it a day and handing Argentina a 1-0 lead.<br>
                          Argentina then went on to win the match 2-0 thanks to 
                          Guillermo Canas, who beat Yevgeny Kafelnikov 6-4, 6-2.<br>

                        For the third time after 2000 and 2001 the Russians will 
                        play in the final of the ARAG WORLD TEAM CUP. On the last 
                        day of the group matches, Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Marat 
                        Safin won the crucial point for Russia with a 6:1 and

                        defeating the British with 2:1.<br>
                        The doubles match lasted only 53 minutes, in which the

                        The 22-year-old Russian won both his singles and doubles 
                        matches on Friday against Great Britain.<br>

                          Russian's 2-1 victory over Great Britain. Although Safin 
                          appeared to struggle early in his match against Martin 
                          Lee, he managed to edge the Briton 7-5, 7-5 on the last 
                          day of Round Robin action in Dusseldorf.<br>
&quot;In the first six games of my match [singles] 
                          I couldnit move or run,&quot; Safin said. &quot;I had 
                          a lot of pain in my back, then it got better and at 
                          least I could serve.&quot;<br>
Safin also proved to be a valuable asset as he and 
                          Kafelnikov crushed Great Britain in doubles, winning 
                          6-1, 6-0 to seal the Russian victory. Earlier, Kafelnikov's 
                          singles slump continued as he fell to Tim Henman 6-2, 
                          7-6(6). Iim disappointed with my individual performance,&quot; 
                          Kafelnikov said. &quot;Iim trying hard. The confidence 
                          is the most important thing... [But] itis a team effort. 
                          We step in for each other. Iim not in such good form, 
                          and Marat is fighting for us.&quot;<br>
Russia now faces Argentina in Saturday's final. Both

                          in the final in 1989. Russia, meanwhile, is playing 
                          in its third consecutive final, having lost both finals 
                          in 2000 and 2001. <br>

                        Marat Safin and Yevgeny Kafelnikov teamed to give Russia 
                        their first victory in World Team Championship play by 
                        winning the deciding doubles rubber.<br>
                        Safin and Kafelnikov defeated the Spanish team of Alex 
                        Corretja and Albert Costa 6-7(1), 6-3, 10-5 in the Match 
                        Tie-Break to even their tie record at 1-1. <br>
                        Safin also won his singles match for the second time this 
                        week - this time defeating Alex Corretja in straight sets. 
                        Safin, who had Russia's lone win in Monday's loss to Germany, 
                        was please with his victory over the Spaniard.<br>
                        &quot;He's a difficult opponent and you have to work hard 
                        to beat him,&quot; Safin said. &quot;I tried to play my 
                        game and to be patient. I'm very happy that I served well 
                        today.&quot;<br>
                        Safin is still holding hope that the Russians can win 
                        their next match on Friday and move into the finals. &quot;We 
                        still have a change to go to the final,&quot; Safin said. 
                        &quot;We want to win this tournament and it's important 
                        for us.&quot;<br>
                        Kafelnikov's struggle on clay this year continued as the 
                        Russian was defeated in straight sets by Albert Costa. 
                        Costa, who was leading 4-1 when play moved indoors, had 
                        to adjust his game against Kafelnikov.<br>
                        &quot;Kafelnikov plays aggressive indoors,&quot; Costa 
                        said. &quot;The match outside was totally different and 
                        I was happier playing outdoors.&quot;<br>

                        Haas won 7-6. With the tie-break he broke resistance of 
                        Kafelnikov. He fought but could not win more than three

                        This victory gave Nicolas Kiefer the chance to make the

                        forced the German to make more errors. <br>
                        Safin won the next set 6-2. Kiefer had to pull his game 
                        together in the third set and that is exactly what he 
                        did. In the second tie-break of the day he had the spectators 
                        on his side.<br>
                        The crowd was so excited about the play that they wave

                        was indescribable; packed stadium, beautiful sunshine, 
                        spectacular play by the German, and victory close at hand. 
                        Kiefer won the last set to lead Germany to its victory 
                        over Russia.<br>

                        Rosset, who has won 15 singles titles in his career, took

                        Roger Federer secured his first Masters Series title by 
                        demolishing Marat Safin in straight sets, 6-1 6-3 6-4. 
                        <br>
                        Marat Safin, who thrashed world number one Lleyton Hewitt 
                        in the quarter-finals, was this time on the receiving 
                        end as Federer cruised to victory. <br>
                        &quot;I have more experience than him and was probably 
                        the favourite but I didn't really play very well as you 
                        can see,&quot; Safin said. <br>
                        &quot;I couldn't bring my tennis to the court and he played 
                        probably the best game of tennis in his life.&quot; <br>
                        Hitting clean winners down the lines from both sides, 
                        the Swiss kept sixth seed Safin lunging in vain throughout 
                        the first set which he clinched 6-1 before Safin had even 
                        warmed up. <br>
Breaks in the first and fifth games left the Russian 
                          trailing the second set 5-1, and he faced two set points 
                          as Federer could not miss. <br>
                        However, the Russian saved both with full-blooded forehands 
                        and he broke for the first time in the next game after 
                        just over an hour of play.<br>
But the Safin revival was not to last and Federer merely 
                          registered another break straight away for a two-set 
                          lead. <br>
Safin was powerless against the marauding Swiss who 
                          was quicker across the Rothenbaum clay, more accurate 
                          and stronger. <br>
Federer held serve to open the third set before breaking 
                          again as the 13,000-capacity crowd braced themselves 
                          for a short day. <br>
But the enigmatic Russian promptly broke Federer to 
                          love and held as he tried to mount a defiant stand in 
                          the face of a barrage of winners. <br>
A series of clubbed returns saw him break again and, 
                          for the first time in the match, Safin appeared to believe 
                          he could launch a challenge. <br>
Federer stood firm, though, and broke back when Safin 
                          fired a double-fisted backhand long. <br>
And at 5-4, Safin spooned a forehand long on the second 
                          match point he faced and the 20-year-old Federer secured 
                          his third career title in a match lasting just over 
                          two hours. <br>

                        Marat Safin and Roger Federer advanced to the final of 
                        the Hamburg Masters Series on Saturday. <br>
                        The sixth-seeded Safin was leading Tommy Robredo 6-2, 
                        4-2 when the Spaniard retired because of &quot;an irritation 
                        in the lower ankle joint.'' <br>
                        &quot;I had no chance beating him like this,'' said Robredo, 
                        who had his right ankle taped during a changeover after 
                        seven games.<br>
                        Safin, who won in US Open in 2000, is assured of the No. 
                        1 ranking in the Champions Race next week. Thomas Johansson, 
                        who lost in the second round, had held the top spot since 
                        he beat Safin in the final of the Australian Open. <br>
                        Federer, who has beaten Safin twice on clay, would fall 
                        one point short of the top ranking even if he beats Safin 
                        in the final.<br>
                        Safin rose to No. 1 when he won the U.S. Open in 2000, 
                        but lost the top spot on the final day of the season to 
                        Gustavo Kuerten. The 22-year-old Russian has not won a 
                        tournament this year, but has a record of 22-9. <br>
                        &quot;I never started so well into a season,'' Safin said. 
                        ``I played well two years ago and I am trying to get to 
                        the point where I was then. I think I am close.''<br>

                        Marat Safin produced an awesome display of power and poise 
                        to overwhelm world number one Lleyton Hewitt in a semi-final 
                        of under an hour at the Hamburg Masters. <br>
                        Hewitt, known for his feisty counter-punching style, was 
                        for once helpless against a barrage of punishing serves 
                        and groundstrokes as Safin ran out a 6-3 6-1 winner. <br>
                        With every shot in Safin's arsenal working perfectly, 
                        Hewitt was rushed into errors time and again and the Australian, 
                        usually so vocal on court, made hardly a sound other than 
                        in anguish. <br>
                        The top seed kept up with the Russian until 3-4 in the 
                        first set when Safin stepped up the pace on his returns 
                        as Hewitt's serve wilted under pressure. <br>
                        And Safin was near-perfect in the second set, his only 
                        mistakes coming in the final game when on three match 
                        points he tried outrageous winners before Hewitt double-faulted 
                        on a fourth. <br>
                        &quot;I felt great as soon as I got out there,&quot; said 
                        Safin, finalist here two years ago as he took their series 
                        to 3-3.<br>
                        Safin gave much of the credit to Swiss former claycourt 
                        star Marc Rosset, who has been helping to hone the Russian's 
                        game in recent weeks.<br>
                        &quot;He's a great guy. There are many parallels between 
                        us. We have a similar approach to the game and I'm sure 
                        we can have a successful partnership,&quot; said the 22-year-old 
                        winner of the US Open 2000. <br>
                        Safin faces the winner of the last quarter-final of the 
                        day between unseeded pair Stefan Koubek of Austria and 
                        Spain's Tommy Robredo. <br>

                        The match was dominated by long rallies and many unforced

                        Sixth seed Marat Safin safely moved through to the second

                        over Spain's Alberto Martin. Opening proceedings at the 
                        Foro Italico, Safin always looked in control against Martin, 
                        as the faster court conditions suited the Russian's powerful 
                        baseline game. <br>
                        Sampras, who won the Tennis Masters Roma title in 1994, 
                        had his best week on the ATP circuit in Houston for some 
                        time, defeating arch-rival Andre Agassi before losing 
                        to Andy Roddick in the final. And, having spent a lot 
                        of time on the practise court with coach Jose Higueras 
                        in recent weeks, Sampras believes he is ready for the 
                        upcoming clay court season.<br>
&quot;I played very good tennis today,&quot; said Safin. 
                          &quot;I was surprised that I could play so good. The 
                          courts are very fast, so it's easy for me to play here 
                          with my serve and my returns.&quot; <br>
Despite having never progressed beyond the second in 
                          three previous attempts in Rome, Safin feels that things 
                          have changed both on and off the court over the last 
                          12 months, and that he is ready to make a serious challenge 
                          for the title this time around. <br>
&quot;Last year was very difficult for me,&quot; said 
                          Safin. &quot;I was injured, I lost early in Monte Carlo, 
                          Rome and Hamburg and I lost my confidence. But this 
                          year has been very good for me. I reached the final 
                          in Australia, I'm playing well and I am confident. In 
                          Rome and Hamburg, I will have to do something special 
                          but I think I have a good chance.&quot; <br>
And Safin is looking beyond the upcoming clay court 
                          season, and has his sights firmly set on the ultimate 
                          goal. &quot;My objective is to finish the year at No. 
                          1,&quot; said Safin, who has been working with his &quot;assistant 
                          coach&quot; Marc Rosset during the last few weeks. &quot;I 
                          have to stay focused, play the way I've been playing 
                          and never give up.&quot; <br>
Safin now meets Belgium's Xavier Malisse, who defeated 
                          qualifier Jose Acasuso to win his first match since 
                          reaching the semifinals in Scottsdale back in March. 
                          Having lost his last five first round matches, Malisse 
                          ended his baron spell with a 6-1, 6-4 victory over the 
                          Spaniard.

                        Moya had two match points at 5-3 in the deciding set before 
                        he eventually won through 6-1 2-6 7-6 (7-4). <br>
                        Moya looked the sharper initially and raced into a 5-1 
                        lead before claiming the set after a terrific point which 
                        saw a deflated Safin sprawled on the floor by the net, 
                        looking on as Moya's gentle lob dropped into the back

                          the run of play, broke for a 5-3 lead.<br>
                          Serving for the match, Moya was taken to several deuces 
                          before Safin eventually claimed it to peg it back to 
                          5-4. <br>
                          It then went to serve and Moya opened up a 5-2 lead 
                          in the tie-break.<br>
                        Safin broke two Moya service points courtesy of two lazy 
                        unforced errors before the Spaniard wrapped it up with 
                        a mini-break of his own followed by a terrific forehand 
                        which caught the outside of the baseline to book his place 
                        in Saturday's semis.</font><font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"><br>

                        Safin, the 2000 U.S. Open champion, was playing his second 
                        quarterfinal in a Masters Series event this year. He lost

                        Marat Safin's run through the Monte Carlo Masters Series 
                        event is proving eventful. <br>
                        His second-round victory over French schoolboy Richard 
                        Gasquet was followed by a win which ended David Nalbandian's 
                        remarkable run of results. <br>
                        The Russian is living up to his second-seeded status in 
                        the principality, but he was pushed by the Argentinian 
                        Nalbandian.<br>
                        An eventual three-set victory, 6-1 6-7 (7/5) 6-2, Safin 
                        looked in danger of becoming the latest victim of last 
                        week's Estoril winner when Nalbandian levelled the match 
                        at one set apiece.<br>
                        But the former US Open champion, who has reportedly lost 
                        his racket sponsorship deal, had too much class and clinched 
                        his place in the quarter-finals. <br>
                        His next opponent will be classic clay-court exponent 
                        Carlos Moya who notched up a 6-1 7-5 victory against fellow 
                        Spaniard Alex Corretja.<br>

                        Gasquet, the youngest qualifier for a Masters event, had

                        Gasquet put up a fight in the opening set but once Safin

                        Sixth seed Marat Safin recorded his first ever victory 
                        at the Tennis Masters Monte Carlo with a 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 
                        victory over rising Spanish star Tommy Robredo. Safin, 
                        who had never progressed beyond the first round in three 
                        previous attempts at the Monte Carlo Country Club, showed 
                        signs that his clay court game is beginning to come together. 
                        <br>
                        &quot;I was lucky that I won,&quot; said Safin. &quot;Now 
                        I'm confident enough to move on and try to think that 
                        I can win this tournament.&quot;<br>
The Russian, who currently stands in second position 
                          in the ATP Champions Race 2002, was happy to have survived 
                          Robredo's challenge - especially after an early start 
                          on Court Central.<br>
&quot;It's very difficult to play at 10 o'clock in 
                          the morning,&quot; said Safin. &quot;Especially against 
                          an opponent like Tommy Robredo. He's also young, he 
                          wants to play, he wants to win and he's very motivated.<br>
&quot;In the middle of the second set, I started to 
                          do something new, hitting the ball and trying to move 
                          him around the court, which in the first set, I could 
                          not do - maybe I was still asleep or something.&quot; 
                   <br>
Safin now goes on to face 15-year-old French sensation 
                          Richard Gasquet in a match the Russian knows he cannot 
                          take lightly. &quot;I think he's a great player,&quot; 
                          said Safin. &quot;You don't have to look at the age 
                          anymore because everybody can play tennis. He has very 
                          good timing, great shots...he's playing in France, he 
                          has nothing to lose.&quot;<br>

                        Marat Safin survived another scare at the Estoril Open 
                        before moving through to the quarterfinals with a 6-3, 
                        5-7, 7-2 victory over Adrian Voinea. <br>
                        The weather in Estoril on Thursday was anything but player 
                        friendly. Extremely windy conditions made it very difficult 
                        for most players to be on top of their game. During his 
                        match with Voinea, Safin asked ATP Supervisor Ed Hardisty 
                        whether or not the match should be played. After determining 
                        there was not a safety risk, Hardisty and tournament officials 
                        decided play should continue.<br>
                        Safin, who needed three sets to overcome David Ferrer 
                        in the first round on Wednesday, found his game at the 
                        right time to end Voinea's challenge. <br>
                        &quot;It was terrible out there today.&quot; Safin said 
                        regarding the weather, which forced several tournament 
                        staff tents to be evacuated for threat they might blow 
                        over.<br>
                        After struggling for two hours and 32 minutes to the windy 
                        win, Safin said the ATP needs to address unplayable conditions 
                        by adopting a wind rule. <br>
                        &quot;It is our job to play and we have to give our best,&quot; 
                        said Safin, who unsuccessfully asked tournament supervisor 
                        Ed Hardisty to postpone the match due to the extreme wind 
                        in the first set. &quot;But it is not enjoyable to play 
                        in these conditions — not for us and not for the spectators. 
                        There should be a wind rule, it is not correct to play 
                        otherwise. The ATP should do something so at least we 
                        can play tennis.&quot;<br>
                        The Russian, who has won two previous clay court titles 
                        (Barcelona, Mallorca in 2000), now meets rising star Jarkko 
                        Nieminen, the 20-year-old from Finland who surprised everyone 
                        last year by reaching the final in Stockholm in only his 
                        second ATP event. <br>
                        Nieminen followed up his first round victory over No. 
                        8 seed Alberto Martin with an equally impressive 6-1, 
                        6-2 win against Martin's fellow Spaniard Galo Blanco. 
                        Nieminen has only dropped eight games in his two matches 
                        so far and will be full of confidence going into his first

                        Russian tennis chief Shamil Tarpishchev denied on Wednesday 
                        that Australian Open finalist Marat Safin, who parted 
                        company with Swede Mats Wilander earlier this year, had 
                        hired Alexander Volkov as his new coach. <br>
                        &quot;Contrary to what the Russian media has reported, 
                        [Alexander] Volkov is not coaching Safin,&quot; Russian 
                        Tennis Federation president Tarpishchev told Reuters. 
                        <br>
Earlier this week, Russian media quoted Tarpishchev 
                          as saying that Volkov and Safin would begin working 
                          together at the Monte Carlo Masters next week. <br>
&quot;Indeed, both Safin and myself have asked Volkov 
                          to coach Marat, but so far without any success,&quot; 
                          added Tarpishchev, who is also Russia's Davis Cup captain. 
                    <br>
&quot;The problem is that Volkov has some big personal 
                          problems at the moment and he can't devote all his time 
                          to coaching.&quot; <br>
Tarpishchev added that Safin also considered hiring 
                          former Russian player Andrei Cherkasov. <br>
&quot;Cherkasov's name has come up as a possible candidate, 
                          but we all hope that Volkov will change his mind,&quot; 
                          Tarpishchev said. <br>
Former top 20 player Volkov coached Safin during the 
                          2000 U.S. Open where the Russian won his first grand 
                          slam title. <br>
Safin teamed up with Wilander, winner of seven grand 
                          slams during his career, in March 2001 but the Swede's 
                          other interests have prevented him from coaching Safin 
                          on the full-time basis. <br>
Safin, 22, who is playing at the Estoril Open in Lisbon 
                          this week, has hired several coaches in addition to 
                          Volkov and Wilander in the last two years. <br>
Andrei Chesnokov and Briton Tony Pickard, who guided

                        Defending champion Juan Carlos Ferrero and Russian superstar 
                        Marat Safin are just two of the top names appearing at 
                        the Estoril Open 2002, which begins on April 8.<br>
Ferrero, who is currently at No. 3 in the world after 
                          claiming four titles last year, will have fond memories 
                          of playing in Estoril 12 months ago after defeating 
                          fellow countryman Felix Mantilla in a 3 set epic.<br>
After struggling with injuries last year, Safin is 
                          regaining the kind of form that took him to No. 1 during 
                          the 2000 season, reaching the final at the Australian 
                          Open in January this year.<br>
Among those also challenging for the title this year 
                          will be 2000 Estoril champion Carlos Moya, as well as 
                          rising Belgian star Xavier Malisse and American heart-throb 
                          Jan Michael Gambill.<br>

                        With Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Marat Safin both electing 
                        to recover from their night of celebrations, Russia was

                        Russia has clinched a place in the semifinals of the 2002 
                        Davis Cup by BNP Paribas in Moscow this afternoon.<br>
                        Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Marat Safin won a thrilling five-set 
                        doubles against Jonas Bjorkman and Thomas Johansson 3-6 
                        7-6 6-7 7-5 6-3 to give Russian an unbeatable 3-0 lead 
                        against Sweden.<br>
                        The Swedes took the first set after breaking Kafelnikov's 
                        serve in the fourth game for a 3-1 lead. The Russians 
                        held onto the rest of their service games, but failed 
                        to break back, losing the set in just over 20 minutes. 
                        <br>
                        Safin rebounded in the second set, holding the Swedes 
                        to love in his first service game. Supported by a noisy, 
                        home crowd in the 13,000-capacity stadium, the Russians 
                        broke Bjorkman's serve in the set's second game to take 
                        a 2-0 lead. <br>
                        But the Swedish team showed no signs of giving up, and 
                        immediately earned three breakpoints on Kafelnikov's serve 
                        in the third game. The Russians managed to save two breakpoints, 
                        but after a long rally, Safin hit the ball into the net 
                        at 30-40. <br>
                        Johansson followed up the break with a strong service 
                        game, holding the Russians to love to even the score at 
                        2-2. Safin felt the pressure from the Swedes in the fifth 
                        game, as Bjorkman pounded two solid returns over the net 
                        to go up 0-30.<br>
                        Safin double-faulted on his next serve, and momentarily 
                        lost his composure, raising his racket high in the air 
                        and yelling. The Swedes took advantage of the three breakpoints 
                        and won the game for a 3-2 lead. <br>
                        The Russians rallied, and in the seventh game, Kafelnikov 
                        saved a breakpoint and then easily won at deuce to bring 
                        the score to 4-3. Kafelnikov and Safin followed that up 
                        by breaking Johansson's serve in the eighth game, evening 
                        the score at 4-4. Safin fired off two aces in the ninth 
                        game to pull Russia ahead 5-4. <br>
                        The teams fought their way to a tiebreak, which Kafelnikov 
                        brought even at 6-6 with an ace. Kafelnikov slammed a 
                        return straight down the line to pull ahead 7-6, and then 
                        win the tiebreak and take the second set. <br>
                        With one set each, the pressure got to the Swedes and 
                        Bjorkman lost his opening service game of the third set. 
                        Safin held the Swedes at love in the second game to give 
                        Russia a 2-0 lead, sending the crowd wild. <br>
                        The Swedes broke back in the 6th game, earning two breakpoints 
                        on Safin's serve to even the set at 3-3 and go on to a 
                        tiebreak. <br>
                        Ignoring screams and cheers from Russian fans, the Swedes 
                        raced ahead and never let the Russians get their footing, 
                        winning the tiebreak 7-2. <br>
                        The fourth set provided an even matchup, until the Russians 
                        broke Bjorkman in the 12th game as he served to stay in 
                        the match. Bjorkman was broken again in the fifth set, 
                        giving Russia a 5-3 lead. Kafelnikov served for the match, 
                        firing off an ace and some solid returns to win 6-3. <br>
                        After the match Kafelnikov confirmed yet again he would 
                        retire. <br>
                        &quot;You may laugh, but I was serious. I believe that 
                        only two Davis Cup ties are left for me before I quit 
                        my career,&quot; he said.<br>
                        &quot;Maybe it's my last chance to win the trophy and 
                        I'm set to do my best to win it. But there's plenty of 
                        other interesting things except tennis in the world.&quot; 
                        <br>
                        The Swedes, who conquered Great Britain in the previous 
                        round had previously never lost to Russia, or the Soviet 
                        Union, in the Davis Cup.<br>
                        Safin and Kafelnikov's victory put Russia 3-0 up in the 
                        best-of-five series, and earned Russia its first spot 
                        in the Davis Cup September's semifinals since 1999. Russia 
                        will meet either Argentina or Croatia.<br>
                        While looking forward to the semifinals, Safin had his 
                        sights set on his immediate plans this evening.<br>
                        "There's an old Russian proverb: 'Once you've done your 
                        deed, relax and enjoy,' " said Kafelnikov.<br>
                        "We were really motivated today and gave it 100 percent. 
                        We knew that if we won the doubles, we wouldn't have to 
                        worry about the singles tomorrow."<br>
                        &quot;The press have often criticized me for partying 
                        too much,&quot; Safin said. &quot;Well tonight nobody 
                        can criticise me for going out. We really wanted to finish 
                        today and now can enjoy ourselves.&quot;<br>

                          Marat Safin gained revenge over Australian Open champion 
                          Thomas Johansson to put Russia ahead in their Davis 
                          Cup quarter-final against Sweden. <br>
                          Safin, who lost to Johansson in the final of this year's 
                          first Grand Slam tournament, won 6-4 6-4 6-4 on the 
                          clay of Moscow's Luzhniki stadium. <br>
                          He dominated early on, breaking Johansson's first two 
                          service games and holding his own serve for a comfortable 
                          4-0 lead.<br>
                          But Johansson fought back to a point where a rattled 
                          Safin, known for his on-court outbursts, lost his temper 
                          when querying a line call. <br>
                          He regained his composure to clinch the set, and it 
                          was then the Swede's turn show the strain, double-faulting 
                          in game seven and failing to turn his forays to the 
                          net into points.<br>
                          Safin broke in the ninth game when, at deuce, he lobbed 
                          for advantage then gained the decisive point when his 
                          opponent again double-faulted. <br>
                          Safin confirmed the break with a love game to close 
                          out 6-4. <br>
                          The Russian then went 5-3 up in the thrid set as Johansson 
                          struggled to hold on and closed out the match on his 
                          serve, turning in an ace as his winning shot. <br>
                          &quot;I was in control from the very beginning,&quot; 
                          said Safin. &quot;It was just good out there.&quot; 
                          <br>
                          YevgenyKafelnikov later stretched the lead in the tie 
                          to 2-0 with a comprehensive 7-6 6-3 6-1 win against 
                          Thomas Enqvist.<br>
                          Kafelnikov looked to be up against a more resilient 
                          opponent in Enqvist, who pushed the Russian to a first-set 
                          tiebreak. <br>
                          Although Enqvist took a 5-3 lead, Kafelnikov hit an 
                          ace to regain his composure before closing out the set 
                          as his opponent tired in a long baseline rally. From 
                          there the Swede fell apart as Kafelnikov lifted the 
                          tempo of his game. Afterwards the Russian was clear 
                          where his motivation had come for the victory.<br>
                          He said: "Marat inspired me a lot with his great playing 
                          today. I felt no pressure on me after his opening victory 
                          and that allowed me to play according to my plan Kafelnikov 
                          and Safin will team up in Saturday's doubles against 
                          Johansson and Jonas Bjorkman.<br>
                          The winning team in the best-of-five series goes on 
                          to face either Argentina or Croatia in the semi-finals.

                        Marat Safin of Russia will face Thomas Johansson in Friday's 
                        opening match of the Davis Cup World Group quarterfinal 
                        tie between Russia and Sweden. <br>
Russia's No. 1 Yevgeny Kafelnikov will challenge Sweden's 
                          Thomas Enqvist in the second singles match of the opening 
                          day on the red clay court of Moscow's Luzhniki indoor 
                          stadium, according to Thursday's draw. <br>
The opening match will be a replay of the Australian 
                          Open final, in which Johansson outclassed Safin in four 
                          sets. <br>
&quot;I don't think the draw makes any difference,&quot; 
                          said Shamil Tarpishchev, Russia's Davis Cup captain

                          downplaying concerns that an exact replay of the year's 
                          first Grand Slam final would benefit Johansson, who 
                          became the first Swedish champion in Melbourne since 
                          Mats Wilander in 1988. <br>
&quot;Everybody knows the strength of both teams,&quot; 
                          Tarpishchev said. &quot;I think it will be a very even 
                          matchup.&quot; <br>
Safin had beaten Johansson in two of their last three 
                          meetings, and many considered the 2000 U.S. Open champion 
                          to be the favorite to take another Grand Slam title, 
                          but the Swede overpowered him. <br>
&quot;We've played four times but we've never played 
                          on clay,&quot; Johansson said on Thursday. &quot;This 
                          time will be a different game.&quot; <br>
Safin added, &quot;This tournament has a different 
                          level of importance.&quot; <br>
This time, Johansson will have to contend not only 
                          with Safin but with Russia's hometown advantage in the 
                          noisy, 13,000-capacity stadium. Russia has not lost 
                          at home since the 1995 World Group final when an invigorated 
                          Pete Sampras secured the U.S. team a 3-2 victory. <br>
The Russian team is also looking to avenge their loss 
                          to Sweden last year in the quarterfinals, when Sweden 
                          swept them aside after Safin was forced to withdraw 
                          with an injury. <br>
&quot;The only thing left to get to be fully satisfied 
                          is the Davis Cup,&quot; said Kafelnikov, 28, who hopes 
                          to add a Davis Cup victory to his two Grand Slam titles 
                          and Olympic Gold medal before retiring. <br>
&quot;So, of course, I'll be focusing on that,&quot; 
                          the soft-spoken Russian said. <br>
Beating Sweden will be a big challenge, however. Sweden 
                          has defeated Russia or the former Soviet Union in all 
                          four of their previous meetings, and both of Sweden's 
                          top players come into the Davis Cup quarterfinal tie 
                          with ATP tournament victories already under their belt 
                          this year. Johansson has the Australian Open title, 
                          while Enqvist won an indoor tournament in Marseille, 
                          where he beat Kafelnikov to make it to the finals. <br>
Saturday's doubles pits Kafelnikov and Safin against 
                          Johansson and Jonas Bjorkman, although both captains 
                          can change their pairs up until one hour before the 
                          match. <br>

                        Russia clashes with Sweden for the fifth time but for 
                        the first time on clay. The win loss record favours Sweden 
                        on hundred percent as the nation has won their four previous 
                        encounters. The quarter-final will take place at the Sports 
                        Palace &quot;Luzhniki&quot; in Moscow, <br>
                        The Russians will rely on the works of Yevgeny Kafelnikov, 
                        Marat Safin, Mikhail Youzhny and Andrei Cherkasov to defeat 
                        the Swedish for the first time in front of their supporting 
                        crowd.<br>
                        The Swedish are led by Australian Open champion Thomas 
                        Johansson. Captain Carl-Axel Hageskog has also included 
                        Thomas Enqvist , Jonas Bjorkman and Magnus Larsson who 
                        will be replacing Andreas Vinciguerra.<br>

                        Thursday night’s bill was exactly what tennis fans come 
                        to tennis tournaments for – great tennis. <br>
                        The evening started with a three-set quarterfinal thriller 
                        between the world No. 1 Hewitt and sixth-seeded Marat 
                        Safin. The match went to a third set tiebreaker and both 
                        players were treated to a standing ovation for their efforts 
                        after Hewitt scored the close 2-6, 6-2, 7-6 (7-4) win.<br>
                        If tennis could always be this inspiring and entertaining, 
                        the sport wouldn’t be struggling for better sponsorship 
                        deals and TV times. Among the many international scribes 
                        who travel the world covering tennis, the opinion seemed 
                        to be unanimous that the Hewitt and Safin encounter was 
                        the best match of the year.<br>
                        Without a doubt, the match was an endorsement for why 
                        players need to rally in matches and not just smack a 
                        serve and hit a volley to end the point. Many of the rallies 
                        in the Hewitt and Safin encounter went 20-25 strokes and 
                        each stroke of the ball brought about new excitement for 
                        the spectators.<br>
                        On a sweltering south Florida evening that saw both players 
                        change sweat-drenched shirts almost as often as they changed 
                        ends, Hewitt displayed a bucketful of his trademark grit 
                        as he fought back to level the match.
                          <br>
                          In the third set Hewitt was at his aggressive best, 
                          breaking Safin three times only for the Australian Open 
                          runner-up to break back on each occasion. After Safin 
                          had broken to level the set at 4-4, Hewitt immediately 
                          broke back, scampering to the net to fire a crosscourt 
                          winner.<br>
Delighted by his effort, Hewitt screamed his approval, 
                          pumping his clenched fist and jumping in the air. But 
                          the celebrations proved premature.<br>
With Hewitt serving for the match, Safin demonstrated 
                          some determination of his own, spectacularly diving 
                          across the court to send a return just over the net 
                          cord and get the break back. Two more breaks and the 
                          set went to a tiebreak won by Hewitt 7-4.<br>
&quot;Marat is a tough player to play because I feel 
                          like he's getting better and better in the areas he's 
                          had some weakness,&quot; said Hewitt. &quot;It's really 
                          tough to find too many weaknesses in his game.<br>
&quot;He played great in the first set, there just 
                          wasn't much I could do. In the second I felt I lifted 
                          a couple of pegs and the third set was just tough... 
                          He's one of the best players in the world, there's no 
                          doubt about that.&quot;
                          <br>
                          Safin, as usual, appeared the ticking time bomb, ready 
                          to explode at any moment during the draining two-hour, 
                          45-minute match.<br>
In the second game of the second set, he argued against 
                          a line call, gesturing wildly while pleading his case 
                          to the umpire. At the same stage of the third set, Safin 
                          engaged in an even more animated debate, kicking his 
                          kit bag before returning to the court.<br>
It has been a testing couple of weeks both on and off 
                          the court for the volatile Russian, who was fined $5,000 
                          by the ATP for verbally abusing a tournament worker 
                          on Wednesday.<br>
Safin's performances on the Miami hardcourts have been 
                          erratic. He made tough work of nearly every match and 
                          was unable to find a way past the in-form Hewitt despite 
                          producing his best tennis of the tournament.<br>
&quot;He (Hewitt) is really consistent, he does not 
                          lose his mind and is always on his game,&quot; said 
                          Safin. &quot;Without a serve you aren't going to beat 
                          this guy. He's number one in the world, he's playing 
                          great.&quot;<br>

                        Australian Open runner-up Marat Safin has been fined $5,000 
                        by the ATP for verbally abusing a sponsor at the Nasdaq-100 
                        Open Masters. <br>
                        The Russian was fined for launching a verbal attack on 
                        a tournament representative after he was refused a new 
                        Mercedes-Benz to replace the one he crashed. <br>
The ATP said the fine handed out by the tournament 
                          supervisor was the same a player would receive for abusing 
                          an on-court official. <br>
The top eight seeds in Miami are all loaned a top of 
                          the range Mercedes for their private use during the 
                          two-week event. <br>
Safin crashed his while driving to his hotel shortly 
                          after arriving in Miami. <br>
He reached the quarter-finals of the event with a 6-3 
                          6-3 win over Chile's Fernando Gonzalez on Wednesday.

                        Marat Safin shut down Master Blaster Fernando Gonzalez 
                        to set up a blockbuster quarterfinal with world No.1 Lleyton 
                        Hewitt at the Nasdaq-100 Open in Miami Wednesday. Safin 
                        blunted the powerful ground strokes of Chilean Gonzalez 
                        - who took out Pete Sampras in the fourth round - to win 
                        6-3, 6-3 in their rain-delayed match.<br>
In a battle between the past two US Open champions, 
                          Safin expects a tight contest with Hewitt. &quot;It 
                          will be a tough match; the score is 2-all and we respect 
                          each other,&quot; Safin said. &quot;He's playing great 
                          and he beat some great players to win Indian Wells. 
                          But I'm also playing well and I am quite confident. 
                          I would love to play against him and I think it's going 
                          to be a great match for spectators. Whoever wins will 
                          go into the semifinals and will have a great chance 
                          to win the tournament.<br>
&quot;Everybody knows that against Hewitt you can't 
                          stay on the baseline and try to overpower him and just 
                          play his game. That's just stupid - you have no chance 
                          to beat him this way. You have to do something else, 
                          which is try to go to the net, try to push him from 
                          the beginning of the match until the end.&quot;<br>
Safin, appearing in his first quarterfinal in Miami, 
                          has a 14-5 match record in 2002, which includes his 
                          run to the Australian Open final. The Russian said that 
                          he was &quot;horrible&quot; in his three-set win over 
                          Peruvian qualifier Luis Horna in the third round, but 
                          that he was very happy with his performance against 
                          Gonzalez. <br>
&quot;There are some days that you are not playing 
                          really well, and some days that you are just feeling 
                          in the right way and you are feeling in a good mood 
                          and you want to play,&quot; Safin said. &quot;Two days 
                          ago I was feeling horrible. I couldn't put one ball 
                          inside the court in practice. I couldn't feel my game. 
                          Today I was feeling great. I'm pretty happy that I can 
                          change my game in one day. &quot;<br>

                        Marat Safin survived a testing encounter with Peruvian 
                        qualifier Luis Horna to advance to the fourth round at 
                        the Nasdaq-100 Open in Miami. Safin was forced to rally 
                        from a set down - and survive a third-set tie-break - 
                        before winning 3-6, 6-3, 7-6(3). The Russian next plays 
                        the winner of Pete Sampras and the one remaining qualifier, 
                        Chile's Fernando Gonzalez.<br>
Horna, who before the tournament had never won a Tennis 
                          Masters Series main draw singles match, had his chances 
                          to effect the biggest upset of the event. But a series 
                          of lapses at crucial moments failed to keep Safin under 
                          pressure. Serving at 5-5, 30-30 in the third set, Horna 
                          double faulted and then hit a drop shot into the net 
                          when Safin was stranded deep behind the baseline.<br>
Horna broke back immediately to force a tie-break. 
                          But at 3-4 he double faulted; on the next point he tried 
                          to surprise Safin by serve/volleying on his second serve, 
                          but Horna pushed his volley long to go down 3-6. Safin 
                          closed out the match the following point.<br>
Despite the victory, Safin said that his game is not 
                          where he would like it to be. Safin continues to move 
                          into the net at every opportunity in a determined attempt 
                          to add more flexibility to his game. Although the short-term 
                          results may not be there yet, Safin is confident that 
                          his plan will reap its reward in future years.<br>
&quot;I'm not satisfied with my game, but I am satisfied 
                          with my win,&quot; Safin said. &quot;Hopefully I'll 
                          play much better in my next match. My plan is to keep 
                          moving to the net. When I'm 26 or 27 it's going to be 
                          difficult to always be playing from the baseline. I 
                          won't have as much energy then as I do now, so I'll 
                          need to play quicker points.&quot;<br>

                        After a tight first set, Marat Safin crushed fellow power-hitter 
                        Mark Philippoussis 7-6(4), 6-1. The Russian secured a 
                        double break at the start of the second set and raced 
                        to a 5-0 lead against Philippoussis, who, lacking match 
                        practice, was unable to sustain his first-set intensity. 
                        Safin was particularly aggressive and punishing on the 
                        Australian's second serve, hitting many clean winners 
                        and also following his returns to the net for put-away 
                        volleys.<br>
Safin now meets Peruvian qualifier Luis Horna, who 
                          defeated 28th seed Sjeng Schalken. Horna had not won 
                          a match at Tennis Masters Series level for this week.<br>
Safin said of Philippoussis: &quot;He's been out for 
                          a long time so it's tough to come back after we've all 
                          been playing for months. But he will get back because 
                          he has a great game.<br>
                        &quot;I'm still not playing as well as I did in 2000, 
                        but I'm trying to get there. If I manage to get there 
                        I will definitely vie for No.1 in the world. My game has 
                        changed a little bit and I have to try to go to the net 
                        all the time and put pressure on the other guy.&quot;<br>

                        Marat Safin has confirmed that his coaching partnership 
                        with Swedish tennis legend Mats Wilander is over. <br>
The 22-year-old Australian Open finalist teamed up 
                          with Wilander in March 2001 but the Swede's busy life 
                          means he no longer has time to coach the Russian player. 
                        <br>
&quot;I think everybody understands that Mats is playing 
                          tournaments on the Senior Tour and that he has a family.&quot; 
                          Safin said. <br>
&quot;It's a bit difficult to have a coach for all 
                          the year. That's what I need, a coach that can spend 
                          with me like 30, 40 weeks a year. He could not make 
                          it for those reasons.&quot; <br>
Safin said he would remain on good terms with Wilander 
                          -- who during a dazzling playing career won seven Grand 
                          Slams and 26 other titles -- but had no regrets about 
                          parting company with him.<br>
&quot;I think it was the right solution just to finish 
                          but I'm still maintaining contact with him. We are good 
                          friends and that's more important than to have a business 
                          together I think,&quot; he said. <br>
Safin made his mark on the men's circuit by winning 
                          the U.S. Open in 2000 but since then he has gone through 
                          a roster of coaches, including Britain's Tony Pickard 
                          and fellow Russians Andrei Chesnokov and Alexander Volkov. 
                       <br>
His friend and manager Amit Naor has taken over coaching 
                          duties for the time being although the Israeli has limited 
                          experience working on court with top players. <br>
&quot;I'm trying to work with him. For the moment it's 
                          going well. I don't want to change anything,&quot; Safin 
                          said. <br>
The Russian will be in action this coming week at the 
                          Pacific Life Open in Indian Wells, California. <br>
The $2,950,000 event is the first Masters Series tournament 
                          of the year. Safin faces Spain's Alberto Martin in the 
                          first round. <br>

                        The baseline replaces the blue line when Russia stages 
                        its Davis Cup quarterfinal against Sweden at the 13,000-seat 
                        ice hockey arena, the Sports Palace Luzhniki in Moscow 
                        next month.<br>
                  The April 5-7th quarterfinal will be the first time 
                          since 1994 that a tie in Russia will not be held at 
                          Moscow's Olympic Stadium, which was not available to 
                          host the tie.<br>
Led by third-ranked Yevgeny Kafelnikov and ninth-ranked 
                          Marat Safin, Russia has been undefeated at home since 
                          1995 when Pete Sampras almost singlehandedly led the 
                          United States to a 3-2 victory over Russia in the Davis 
                          Cup final on red clay.<br>
The 28-year-old Kafelnikov announced last year he would 
                          retire if the Russians captured the 2001 Davis Cup title. 
                          But Sweden scrapped his plans by scoring a 4-1 victory 
                          over a Russian team that played without Safin in last 
                          year's quarterfinal at Malmo, Sweden. Kafelnikov said 
                          capturing the Cup could culminate his career.<br>
&quot;Davis Cup keeps me going as I want to win it 
                          badly before I retire,&quot; Kafelnikov said. &quot;I 
                          want it so badly it puts pressure on me. I have won 
                          majors, so there's nothing left to prove there.&quot;<br>

                        Marat Safin was eliminated by Bohdan Ulihrach in three 
                        sets Wednesday in the second round of the $713,000 ABN 
                        Amro indoor tournament. <br>
                        Safin, the 2000 U.S. Open champion and a finalist at the 
                        Australian Open last month, lost 1-6, 6-3, 6-2. <br>
                        &quot;He was just too good for me today,&quot; said the 
                        Russian, a semifinalist in Rotterdam three years ago. 
                      <br>
&quot;It's a little difficult to play him as you've 
                          got to keep up with him. But I just did not play any 
                          great tennis and easily gave him the breaks. <br>
The 26-year-old Czech, who had never made it past the 
                          second round in five previous attempts, surprised the 
                          world number seven with the ferocity of his serves. 
                      <br>
Although Safin, who had struggled to beat Slovakia's 
                          Dominik Hrbaty in the previous round, won the first 
                          set dropping only one game, he never looked comfortable 
                          and made numerous unforced errors throughout the match. 
                       <br>
Safin, the 2000 U.S. Open champion, also had major 
                          problems while serving, winning only 27 percent of his 
                          second serves and managed to convert only two of the 
                          seven breakpoints he earned. <br>

                          breakers in which he prevailed, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (7-4). 
                          Safin had been winless here since making the semifinals 
                          in 1999.<br>
Hrbaty, who was sidelined with a foot injury in the 
                          Davis Cup first-round loss to the United States last 
                          week, played his first match since the fourth round 
                          at the Australian Open. He eliminated Safin in the opening 
                          round at Rotterdam in 2000.<br>
&quot;It's difficult every time we play each other,&quot; 
                          Safin said. &quot;We know each other well. We always 
                          play good matches with good rallies. I'm pretty confident, 
                          but he's always a tough opponent.&quot;<br>
Safin, the third seed, has been hot and cold this season. 
                          He reached his second career Grand Slam final at the 
                          Australian Open, but fell to Thomas Johansson after 
                          winning the first set.<br>
The 22-year-old from Moscow was blown out by Roger 
                          Federer two weeks ago in his opening match in Russia's 
                          first-round Davis Cup tie against Switzerland, but clinched 
                          the victory with a win over Michel Kratochvil.<br>
Next in line is Bogdan Ulihrach of the Czech Republic, 
                          who rallied to defeat Kratochvil, 3-6, 7-5, 6-2.<br>

                        Australian Open runner-up Marat Safin struggled through 
                        Michel Kratochvil in the second reverse singles match 
                        Sunday to give Russia a 3-2 first-round victory over Switzerland 
                        in Davis Cup World Group play. <br>
                        Safin, No. 7 in the ATP Tour rankings, won in straight 
                        sets 6-1, 7-6 (6), 6-4 on clay at the Olympic Indoor stadium. 
                     <br>
Russia was one step away from the victory, leading 
                          2-1 after Saturday's doubles, when Switzerland's No. 
                          1 Roger Federer whitewashed Yevgeny Kafelnikov in Sunday's 
                          first reverse singles to level the tie 2-2. <br>
The 20-year-old Federer posted a straight-sets victory 
                          7-6 (6), 6-1, 6-1 to hand Kafelnikov, a five-time Kremlin 
                          Cup winner, his first loss in Moscow since July 1999, 
                          when he lost to Karol Kuchera in the Davis Cup World 
                          Group qualifier against Slovakia. <br>
The Swiss broke Russia's No. 1 in the opening game 
                          of the first set, but Kafelnikov equalized in the fourth 
                          game and both players held their serve to decide the 
                          set on a tiebreaker. <br>
Down 2-6 on a tiebreaker, Kafelnikov won four consecutive 
                          points to equalize 6-6, but then double-faulted, and 
                          Federer served to win the tiebreaker and the set. <br>
Federer, the winner of the Hopman Cup this year and 
                          a finalist at Milan Indoor last Sunday, needed just 
                          17 minutes to go 5-0 in the second set and fired his 
                          12th ace to close it in 22 minutes for a convincing 
                          2-0 lead. <br>
The third set was no different - the same one-way traffic 
                          game - but just five minutes longer. <br>
Federer fired 15 aces to Kafelnikov's nine. The Russian 
                          made seven double faults.<br>
&quot;For me personally, it was great tennis this weekend,&quot; 
                          Federer said. &quot;I hope, next year we will reach 
                          semifinals or even finals.&quot; <br>
Supported by a sellout crowd of 14,000, Safin met no 
                          resistance from his opponent in the first set, winning 
                          five games in a row to close it in 22 minutes. Down 
                          1-4 and 30-40 in the second set, the Russian saved a 
                          break point with a leaping volley to break Kratochvil 
                          back in the next game and force a tiebreaker. <br>
He capitalized on the Swiss's unforced mistakes to 
                          prevail on a tiebreaker and take a 2-0 lead in the match. 
                     <br>
The third set saw the same scenario - Safin was broken 
                          in the third game. He fought back in the eighth game 
                          and jumped to a 40-15 lead in the 10th game on Kratochvil's 
                          serve. The Swiss saved one break point, but then sent 
                          a forehand wide to lose the set and the match. <br>
&quot;It was really difficult in the end,&quot; Safin 
                          said. &quot;I was nervous. I really didn't want to lose 
                          in front of the home crowd.&quot; <br>
It was Safin's third decisive victory in the Davis 
                          Cup competition. In 1999 he beat Nicolas Kiefer to help 
                          Russia into the second round and defeated Dominik Hrbaty 
                          in the quarterfinals before Russia lost to Australia 
                          in semifinals. <br>
The match was the first between the two nations. Switzerland 
                          had a 2-0 record against the former Soviet Union. <br>
In April quarterfinals, Russia will face the winner 
                          of the Great Britain-Sweden first-round tie. <br>

                        Marat Safin and Yevgeny Kafelnikov, playing together for 
                        the first time since last February, won the doubles match 
                        in four sets Saturday to give Russia a 2-1 edge over Switzerland 
                        in first-round Davis Cup play.<br>
                        Kafelnikov and Safin prevailed over Roger Federer and 
                        Marc Rosset 6-2, 7-6 (6), 6-7 (0), 6-2 on clay at Olympic 
                        Indoor stadium. <br>
                        The Russians staged a hollow start, breaking the Swiss 
                        duo at love in the opening game of the match and then 
                        again on a deuce in the fifth game to close the first 
                        set in 28 minutes for a 1-0 lead in the match. <br>
                        Down 4-5 and 30-40 in the 10th game of the second set, 
                        Safin fired an ace to save a set point and later the Russian 
                        pair prevailed on a tiebreaker for a convincing 2-0 lead. 
                        <br>
                        But the Swiss team showed no signs of giving up and shocked 
                        their opponents, saving four match balls in the 10th game 
                        of the third set and whitewashing the Russian pair at 
                        love on a tiebreaker to stay in the match. <br>
                        &quot;Everything worked perfectly today,&quot; Safin said 
                        after the match. &quot;And though we lost the third set 
                        on a tiebreaker at love, our performance in the fourth 
                        set was brilliant.&quot; <br>
                        Supported by a home crowd of 10,000, the Russians came 
                        alive breaking the guests twice for a 4-love lead in the 
                        decisive fourth set. They saved two breakpoints in the 
                        sixth game and wrapped up the victory on a deuce in the 
                        eighth game.<br>
                        Kafelnikov can clinch the best-of-5 match series if he 
                        beats Federer in Sunday's first reverse singles. <br>
                        Safin is scheduled to play Michel Kratochvil in the last 
                        singles. But both captains are allowed to replace one 
                        player during the final day of the tie.<br>

                        Russia and Switzerland were tied at 1-1 after the opening 
                        day matches of the Davis Cup World Group first round tie 
                        on Friday.<br>
Russia's Sydney Olympic champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov 
                          levelled the scores with a 6-3, 4-6, 1-6, 7-6 (7/3), 
                          6-2 win over Michel Kratochvil after Swiss No. 1 Roger 
                          Federer put his squad ahead beating this season's Australian 
                          Open runner-up Marat Safin in the first match of the 
                          day.<br>
Russia's 27-year-old star Kafelnikov, No. 4 in the 
                          world, took three hours to recorded his second win over 
                          Kratochvil in their two head-to-head meetings.<br>
Kafelnikov seized the lead halfway into the opening 
                          set, breaking his 22-year-old rival's serve in the seventh 
                          game. He kept his advantage through to take the first 
                          in 31 minutes.<br>
It was all square in the second set until the 10th 
                          game, when Kratochvil managed to break to level.<br>
In the third the Swiss player, 43rd in the world, moved 
                          up a gear to seize an early 4-1 lead. Later he broke 
                          again to take a 2-1 advantage in the match.<br>
The rivals traded breaks throughout the fourth set 
                          forcing a tiebreak, which the more accurate Kafelnikov 
                          won.<br>
In the deciding set Kratochvil fought tooth and nail 
                          but failed to resist the power and precision of the 
                          host's attacks. Kafelnikov produced three breaks against 
                          the visitor's one to win the set and the match<br>
Earlier on Friday Switzerland's tennis talent Federer 
                          put his squad 1-0 up with a 7-5, 6-1, 6-2 win against 
                          Safin in the opening match.<br>
Federer pulled his head-to-head record with Safin to 
                          1-1, beating his opponent on the clay courts of Moscow's 
                          Olympic indoor tennis stadium in 95 minutes.<br>
Both rivals started the match cautiously, keeping their 
                          serves until the 11th game, when Federer, 13th in the 
                          world, broke to gain a 6-5 lead before taking the opening 
                          set in 41 minutes.<br>
The Swiss squad's 20-year-old leader was completely 
                          in command in the second set, allowing his Russian opponent 
                          who suffered lapses of concentration, to win only one 
                          game in the set. Federer took it in 25 minutes.<br>
In the third Safin, ranked seventh in the world, failed 
                          to stage a comeback despite the support of former Russian 
                          president Boris Yeltsin, while Federer broke early to 
                          clinch a 3-0 lead, going on to take the set and the 
                          opening match.<br>
Federer said he had not expected to win so easily.<br>
&quot;I'm glad to win so easy today as I'm supposed 
                          to play in the doubles match on Saturday and another 
                          singles on Sunday,&quot; Federer said. &quot;It was 
                          important for me to win in three sets to be at my full 
                          strength in the weekend.&quot;<br>
&quot;It was not easy at all to win the opening set. 
                          Marat (Safin) also had several break points but I was 
                          a little bit more lucky to take the lead,&quot; he added. 
                          &quot;But in the second and third sets I experienced 
                          no troubles at all.&quot; <br>

                          practised well this week,&quot; Kratochvil said.<br>
                          &quot;I think we have a good chance to get a good result 
                          here. I'm looking forward to it.&quot; <br>
                          It is the first time Russia and Switzerland have played 
                          each other in the Davis Cup since the collapse of the 
                          Soviet Union.<br>
                          &quot;I think that getting used to the clay is tough 
                          for both teams in the middle of the indoor season. We 
                          will see who had more time, who feels better mentally,&quot; 
                          said Federer, who won the Sydney International last 
                          month. <br>
                          Tarpishchev said last month that Russia had deliberately 
                          chosen clay over a faster carpet surface because it 
                          suited Safin and Kafelnikov better. <br>
                          Kafelnikov said he was relieved not to be playing 31-year-old 
                          Rosset in the singles. <br>
                          &quot;I didn't want to play one of the most uncomfortable 
                          players for me,&quot; he said. &quot;But this does not 
                          at all mean that my match against Michel Kratochvil 
                          will be an easy one. I think we should be looking forward 
                          to a very interesting match.&quot;<br>

                          Australian Open finalist Marat Safin will lead Russia's 
                          Davis Cup team against Switzerland after pulling out 
                          of the Milan Indoor tournament to practise on clay ahead 
                          of next week's first round tie.<br>
Russian captain Shamil Tarpishchev on Monday named 
                          a five-man squad, with Safin and Yevgeny Kafelnikov 
                          playing singles on the red clay of Moscow's Olympiisky 
                          Sports Complex on February 8-10.<br>
Teenager Mikhail Yuzhny and Davis Cup newcomers Andrei 
                          Stolyarov and Denis Golovanov round out the Russian 
                          squad.
                          <br>
                          Tarpishchev said Russia chose clay over a faster carpet 
                          surface because it better suited Safin and Kafelnikov.<br>
&quot;I think the key to this tie will be which team 
                          has more time to practise on clay, and therefore can 
                          better adjust to a slow surface,&quot; Tarpishchev told 
                          Reuters on Monday.<br>
&quot;Both Safin and Kafelnikov were scheduled to play 
                          this week in Milan but have decided to pull out of the 
                          indoor tournament in order to have more clay-court preparation 
                          instead.<br>
                          &quot;Kafelnikov came to Moscow on Saturday and he already 
                          had a good workout this morning while Safin arrives 
                          on Tuesday.&quot;<br>
Tarpishchev said he counted on Safin to be at his best 
                          despite a disappointing loss in Sunday's Australian 
                          Open final to Sweden's Thomas Johansson at Melbourne 
                          Park.<br>
A huge favourite to win his second grand slam title 
                          Safin, who turned 22 on Sunday, was stunned by the Swede 
                          in four sets on the hard Rebound Ace surface.<br>
&quot;I don't think he (Safin) should look down on 
                          himself following Sunday's loss,&quot; Tarpishchev said.<br>
&quot;He is in fine form at the moment and this defeat 
                          should help him in the long run. It will be an extra 
                          incentive for him to achieve a lot more, to finally 
                          show all his potential.<br>
&quot;He will only need a day or two of rest and to 
                          acclimatise himself to a different climate and time 
                          zone.&quot;<br>

                          Thomas Johansson became the first Swede since Stefan 
                          Edberg to win a Grand Slam singles title as he stunned 
                          Marat Safin of Russia in four sets to win the Australian 
                          Open in Melbourne.<br>
                          Marat Safin, who'd beaten Pete Sampras and Tommy Haas 
                          on the way to his second Grand Slam final, began the 
                          match the better, taking advantage of a tentative Johansson 
                          to win the first set 6-3.<br>
                          The Russian was in command and must have believed he 
                          was on his way to the title.<br>
                          Johansson, however, had other ideas and lifted his game 
                          at the start of the second set.<br>
                          As the rallies became longer, Johansson's speed around 
                          the court became more telling, and one break was enough 
                          to give the Swede the set 6-4 and level the match at 
                          one set apiece. <br>
                          Safin began to tire in the third set and Johansson sensed 
                          his chance, breaking the Russian in the seventh game 
                          thanks to a double-fault and holding serve to take a 
                          two sets to one advantage. When he broke in the opening 
                          game of the fourth set, it looked as if Johansson might 
                          run away with it, but the propsect of a first Grand 
                          Slam title clearly got to his nerves and he dropped 
                          serve in the fourth game to allow Safin back in. <br>
                          Games then went with serve as Johansson, always playing 
                          catch-up, fought hard not to allow Safin to get ahead, 
                          and eventually forced a tie-break. <br>
                          Suddenly playing superbly again, Johansson stormed to 
                          a 5-0 lead, and at 6-1, he had five match points. Safin 
                          saved the first before a huge serve made it 6-3, and 
                          then a poor backhand from Johansson made it 6-4 to the 
                          Swede. But it would be fourth time lucky for Johansson 
                          as a Safin lob landed just long over the baseline to 
                          hand Johansson a famous victory.<br>
                          "Thomas played too good today, I couldn't do anything 
                          as we all can see," Safin said afterwards.<br>
                          "I want to say congratulations for a first Grand Slam 
                          title...enjoy this as much as you can, eh? It is an 
                          important thing."<br>

                          Sweden's Mats Wilander, who coached Marat Safin last 
                          year, is hoping the Russian loses Sunday's Australian 
                          Open final, Swedish daily Dagens Nyheter has reported.<br>
                          &quot;If we're going to continue working together, it's 
                          probably best he loses the final,&quot; Wilander told 
                          the paper.<br>
                          Wilander said losing against Swede Thomas Johansson 
                          could mean more to Safin's future development.<br>
                          &quot;You don't learn anything by winning a Grand Slam 
                          final, but you do by losing one. I know that from experience.&quot;<br>
                          Wilander won seven Grand Slam titles during his career 
                          but also lost four finals.<br>
                          The Swede stopped coaching Safin in November to spend 
                          time with his family after deciding he could only work 
                          with the Russian for 20 weeks a year.<br>
                          Wilander said he will talk to Safin about a collaboration 
                          for this year after the Australian Open. <br>

                          Marat Safin moved closer to his second Grand Slam title 
                          Friday, rebounding after a rain delay to beat Tommy 
                          Haas 6-7 (5), 7-6 (4), 3-6, 6-0, 6-2 and reach the Australian 
                          Open final. <br>
On Sunday, Safin will meet 16th-seeded Thomas Johansson, 
                          who beat unseeded Jiri Novak in five sets Thursday night. 
                       <br>
Safin beat Pete Sampras for the 2000 U.S. Open title 
                          and ousted him here in the fourth round, but made too 
                          many errors early against Haas.<br>
Then, after a 50-minute rain delay with Safin leading 
                          1-0 in the fourth set, Haas won only 11 points for the 
                          rest of the set. <br>
Safin broke for a 3-1 lead in the final set on three 
                          errors by Haas and a spectacular crosscourt serve return. 
                       <br>
The Russian broke again in the final game, setting 
                          up match point with a forehand crosscourt that Haas 
                          volleyed into the net. Haas served the sixth of his 
                          double faults to end the match of 4 hours, 28 minutes, 
                          including the rain delay.<br>
At the start, a forehand volley miss that left Safin 
                          at 4-6 proved costly in the first-set tiebreaker. Haas 
                          finished by drawing him in with a drop shot and hitting 
                          a backhand down the line. <br>
In both of the first two sets, Haas broke first, then 
                          was broken back. <br>
In the second, two double-faults by the German helped 
                          Safin rebound to 3-3. The ninth-seeded Russian gained 
                          a 5-3 lead in the tiebreaker with two winners and cashed 
                          in his second set point with a heavy serve. <br>
The seventh-seeded Haas, however, saved a break point 
                          at 2-2 in the third with a diving forehand drop volley. 
                          He gained the key break for 4-2 by saving two game points 
                          with backhand winners.<br>
The rain came after an afternoon when the temperature 
                          climbed to 95 degrees, and a refreshed Safin played 
                          impeccable tennis the rest of the way.<br>
Safin, rebounding from a back injury early last year, 
                          was a quarterfinalist at Wimbledon and a semifinalist 
                          at the U.S. Open, where he lost to Sampras. Lleyton 
                          Hewitt beat Sampras in the final. 
In 19 previous Grand Slam tournaments, Haas had been 
                          past the fourth round only once, when he reached the 
                          Australian Open semifinals in 1999. <br>

                          Ferreira had gone into the match having battled to two 
                          draining five-set victories in the two previous rounds, 
                          and it seems his body just gave in.<br>
                          &quot;I feel great everywhere else. It's not because 
                          I'm older but obviously it's telling me I've played 
                          a lot of matches,&quot; he said. <br>
                          In the semis, Safin will meet the winner of the match 
                          between Tommy Haas of Germany and the unseeded Chilean 
                          Marcelo Rios.<br>
                          Rios was runner-up to Petr Korda in 1998 and after a 
                          couple of years out of the limelight, he appears back 
                          to his best again.<br>

                          Russia's Marat Safin has been fined US$1,000 for uttering 
                          an audible obscenity during his third round match against 
                          compatriot Mikhail Youzhny, during which he argued heatedly 
                          with chair umpire Norm Chryst. <br>
Ninth seed Safin, who beat Pete Sampras on Monday, 
                          clashed with Chryst after the official handed him a 
                          code violation for unsportsmanlike conduct when he hit 
                          a line judge with a ball during the match on Saturday. 
                       <br>
Safin said he had merely hit the ball behind him to 
                          a ballboy and had no intention of hitting the official. 
                          But he clashed with Chryst over the incident, arguing 
                          heatedly with him during a change of ends. <br>
Safin later accused Chryst, with whom he had clashed 
                          before, of treating him with disrespect. <br>
A spokesman for the International Tennis Federation, 
                          which sanctions grand slam events, said on Tuesday the 
                          fine was handed to Safin after video tapes of the incident 
                          had been reviewed and the umpire had spoken to the tournament 
                          referee. <br>
The biggest fine levied in the tournament so far has 
                          been US$2,000 against Croatian Ivan Ljubicic for an 
                          audible obscenity during his first round win over Czech 
                          Bohdan Ulihrach.<br>
South African Wayne Ferreira -- through to the quarter-finals 
                          of a grand slam event for the first time in eight years 
                          -- has been fined twice so far. <br>
Ferreira was fined $1,000 for an audible obscenity 
                          in the second round and then $500 for racquet abuse 
                          as he fought back from two sets and 1-5 down to beat 
                          Ljubicic in the third round. <br>

                          Russia's Marat Safin has beaten Pete Sampras in one 
                          of the best Australian Open matches of all time to reach 
                          the quarter-finals in Melbourne. <br>
                          Safin led by two sets to love but Sampras stunningly 
                          hit back to within a point of taking it to a decider 
                          only for Safin to hold on for a 6-2, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 
                          7-6 (10-8) victory. He'll now meet South African Wayne 
                          Ferreira for a place in the semi-finals. <br>
                          Sampras looked on his way out in straight sets as Safin 
                          hammered him 6-2, 6-4 to take a commanding lead.<br>
                          The American's usually dominant serve was blunted by 
                          huge returns from the Russian, and when Safin broke 
                          early in the third set, it looked all over.<br>
                          But finding reserves of energy and producing some truly 
                          outstanding tennis, Sampras fought back to 4-4 in the 
                          third and somehow won the ensuing tie-break 7-5 to get 
                          himself right back in it.<br>
                          The fourth set was predictably tight, but Sampras had 
                          to save a break point at 3-4 before forcing one of his 
                          own on the Safin serve at 5-5. <br>
                          The set would go to a tie-break and it was a classic.<br>
                          Sampras achieved the first mini-break and led 3-0 but 
                          Safin got the break back to trail 4-3, and went on to 
                          force a match point at 7-6, only put a relatively easy 
                          forehand pass in the net.<br>
                          The American then had a set point at 8-7 but Safin shut 
                          the door with a brilliant backhand down the line, and 
                          then won his next service point to give him a second 
                          match point.<br>
                          That was the cue for a fantastic rally as a huge Sampras 
                          serve was returned at his feet by Safin. Sampras' volley 
                          looked every inch a winner but Safin produced a stunning 
                          forehand pass on the run to clinch a famous victory.<br>
                          &quot;It was a great match for both of us - it was a 
                          great comeback from Pete,&quot; Safin said. &quot;The 
                          people, they were supporting him very much ... it was 
                          very difficult. <br>
&quot;But I played a great tiebreaker in the fourth 
                          and deserved to win.&quot; <br>
Ninth-seeded Safin and Sampras, seeded eighth, were 
                          the only Grand Slam titlists left in the fourth round 
                          of the men's draw at Melbourne Park after an exodus 
                          of stars in the opening rounds.<br>
Safin advanced to a quarterfinal against unseeded veteran 
                          Wayne Ferreira. <br>
&quot;He came up with the big shots, the big serves 
                          at the right times,&quot; Sampras said. &quot;It's a 
                          tough one to lose. I played well enough in the third 
                          and fourth (sets), but I didn't convert the points I 
                          needed.&quot; <br>
Sampras converted only one of his seven breakpoint 
                          opportunities in the 3 hour, 33-minute match, while 
                          Safin converted four of his 13 chances and had 64 winners 
                          to 62. But he made half as many errors, with 31 to 60 
                          for Sampras. <br>
The 21-year-old Safin is now 4-3 in head-to-heads against 
                          Sampras, who won the last of his record 13 Grand Slam 
                          titles at Wimbledon 2000. <br>
With seventh-seeded Tommy Haas the highest-ranking 
                          player still in contention, Safin is now the overwhelming 
                          favorite to win the year's first major. <br>
&quot;I have more experience than the other guys - 
                          they've never won a Grand Slam. But I have very tough 
                          opponents ahead,&quot; Safin said. &quot;Ferreira, it 
                          doesn't matter if he's won a slam or not, he's tough.&quot;

                          Marat Safin continues to look like a potential Australian 
                          Open champion after he dismantled the game of compatriot 
                          Mikhail Youzhny to reach the fourth round in Melbourne.<br>
                          The Russian won 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to set up a clash with 
                          Pete Sampras or Nicolas Escude, and join Tommy Haas 
                          and Roger Federer in the last 16.<br>
                          Safin has been quietly creeping through the draw, making 
                          no fuss but playing well to cruise through his opening 
                          matches.<br>
                          The 2000 US Open champion hit 12 aces and 36 winners 
                          against Youzhny, a fine player, but not yet in the class 
                          of Safin.<br>
                          The elder Russian was too powerful for his compatriot, 
                          blistering groundstrokes constantly leaving Youzhny 
                          on the back foot.<br>
                          In the end, Safin clinched victory in an hour and 45 
                          minutes and he'll now wait to see if Sampras can beat 
                          Escude to set up what would be a repeat of the 2000 
                          US Open, which Safin won in straight sets.<br>

                          double quick time on Thursday to book his place in the 
                          third round of the tournament.<br>
                          But the Russian was equally swift to play down his chances 
                          of winning a tournament which has seen seed after seed 
                          fall by the wayside.<br>
                          The 2000 US Open champion, who will celebrate his 22nd 
                          birthday on the day of the final, required just an hour 
                          and 52 minutes to ease past Rochus, whose challenge 
                          ebbed away after his loss of the second set tie-break.<br>
                          Safin clobbered 13 aces as he moved through 6-2, 7-6 
                          (8-6), 6-1 and a place in the third round against fellow 
                          Russian Mikhail Youzhny.<br>
                          He said it was easy to think the tournament was winnable 
                          after the exit of so many top players but it was essential 
                          to keep focus on the job in hand.<br>
                          ''You need to have this on your mind, so you have to

                          and that is what I did,'' said the Russian.<br>
                          ''You still have other guys who are playing well, and 
                          young guys, you haven't even heard about them, but they 
                          are doing well and they are very dangerous. Everybody 
                          wants to do well here.<br>
                          ''I want to do well here, it is a huge opportunity, 
                          but we have a very hard part of the draw: we have Sampras, 
                          I have Escude and Youzhny, the biggest star in Russia,

                          Anthony Dupuis 7-5 6-4 6-2 in the last match on Vodafone 
                          Arena, Tuesday. <br>
                          Safin, who is known for his fast serve (clocked at 220 
                          km/h at last year's US Open ) and Grand Slam win over 
                          Pete Sampras at the 2000 US Open, dropped from No.1 
                          in the world to No.11 after sustaining a back injury 
                          in 2001.<br>
                          There was no sign of back problems when Safin and Dupuis 
                          matched stroke for stroke in a tight first set. While 
                          Dupuis made better at first serves and forehand winners, 
                          Safin countered with good play at the net. <br>
                          In the second set Safin increased his tally to 21 net 
                          winners. Despite his comfortable position, Safin became 
                          increasingly testy in the final third set, questioning 
                          line calls and his own judgement on his way to a possible 
                          fourth round re-match with Pete Sampras. Both Sampras 
                          and Safin will be looking to capitalise on the early 
                          upset of top seed Lleyton Hewitt and the withdrawal 
                          of former champion Andre Agassi. <br>
                          Safin is one of countless top names to battle injury, 
                          which is becoming more common in the heavy-hitting, 
                          gruelling schedule of professional tennis. Agassi, Mary 
                          Pierce and Serena Williams are some of the big names 
                          in just the past few days to fall by the wayside due 
                          to play-induced injuries. <br>

                          Russian superstar Marat Safin tapped the honor as the 
                          ATP's Fans' Favorite Player, based on results from fans 
                          voting on an ATPtennis.com poll.<br>
                          The 21-year-old blew away the competition, receiving 
                          22 percent or 50,324 of the 228,746 votes cast on the 
                          Web site. He edged out Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten, who 
                          came in second place with 38,886 votes or 17 percent 
                          of the total tally.<br>
                          American Andre Agassi took third place with 14 percent, 
                          while Juan Carlos Ferrero claimed 10 percent and Pete 
                          Sampras rounded out the top five with 9 percent of the 
                          vote.<br>
                          The rest of the players came in as follows: Goran Ivanisevic

                          Safin, who ended the year in 11th place in the ATP Champions 
                          Race 2001, won two titles in 2001, in Tashkent and St. 
                          Petersburg. He has claimed one Grand Slam title in his 
                          career, at the 2000 US Open.<br>

                          Top seed Marat Safin of Russia was tipped out in the

                          he will still be a force at the Australian Open. <br>
                          &quot;It's better to be this way, it's very good for 
                          me. I have no pressure,&quot; Safin said. <br>
                          &quot;If I can get through the first week I will be 
                          very dangerous in the second week.&quot;<br>
                          Marat Safin of Russia lost 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 in the second

                          Top seed Marat Safin rallied from a set down to defeat 
                          Michael Chang 2-6, 6-3, 6-4 and advance to the second 
                          round of the Heineken Open Auckland. Safin was very 
                          sluggish early, dropping serve twice in the opening 
                          set before finding his focus in the second set. The 
                          players traded early breaks in the third set before 
                          Safin's awesome power from the baseline eventually wore 
                          down Chang.<br>
                          &quot;For the first match of the year, I think I played 
                          quite well, except for the first set,&quot; Safin said. 
                          &quot;I never played a set in December so it's a little 
                          bit difficult. But it's OK, I get used to the ball and 
                          the speed. I'm satisfied with my game and my motivation.&quot;<br>
                          It's better to play three sets, a little bit struggling 
                          at the beginning and then you fight and you win the 
                          match. To win easy, you have no clue how you are playing. 
                          I prefer to play three sets a little bit tough. I have 
                          an idea what I have to improve for the Australian Open 
                          after this week.<br>
                          I think for the last year, I had quite serious problems 
                          with my forehand and I lost a little bit of my game 
                          during the last year. I think finally I've found my 
                          game and I'm playing the same way I played in 2000. 
                          With time, I'll be in the same shape like two years 
                          ago.<br>
                          On a lighter note, Safin was chided by the media for 
                          not having broken a racquet during the match. &quot;It's 
                          my first day on the job, give me some time!&quot;.<br>

                          Former US Open champion Marat Safin, who finished the 
                          ATP Champions Race 2000 at No.2 in the world, will play 
                          in the Heineken Open 2002 from January 7-12. <br>
                          Tournament Director Graham Pearce said: &quot;One of 
                          the world's most exciting tennis players is coming to 
                          Auckland to take part in the 2002 Heineken Open and 
                          play in the Vodafone singles.&quot; <br>
                          Safin, 21 finished the ATP Champions Race 2001 in 11th 
                          place. <br>
                          After overcoming injury problems early in 2001, the 
                          Moscow native proceeded to put in some good performances 
                          in the big events. Safin made the quarterfinals of Wimbledon, 
                          falling to eventual champion Goran Ivanisevic. At Indianapolis 
                          he reached the semifinals before going down to Pat Rafter. 
                          As the defending champion, he then progressed to the 
                          semifinals of the US Open before losing to Pete Sampras.<br>
                          The following week he won Tashkent and then made the 
                          semifinals of Lyon.<br>
                          2000 was a marquee year for Safin as he won seven titles 
                          (for a career total of nine), including the US Open 
                          and two Masters Series events - Toronto and Paris. He 
                          also topped the list of aces in 2000 with 921 and is 
                          known as one of the hardest groundstoke hitters.<br>
                          Safin challenged for the world number one at the Tennis 
                          Masters Cup in Lisbon in November 2000 after good results 
                          indoors in Europe. He has been tipped by many to be 
                          a future world number one.<br>
                          Former world number one, Sweden's Mats Wilander, coaches 
                          Safin and is expected to travel with him to Auckland.<br>
                          It will be Safin's second time to Auckland. In 1999, 
                          as an 18-year-old, he played in the Heineken Open, winning 
                          his first round against Gianluca Pozzi of Italy before 
                          being beaten by Kiwi star Brett Steven in the second 
                          round.<br>
                          The Heineken Open, featuring the Vodafone singles and 
                          doubles, will be held at the ASB BANK Tennis Centre 
                          in Auckland from January 7-12, 2002.<br>
