                  by Jo Sirman<br>
                  <a href="http://www.daviscup.com/" target="_blank">Daviscup.com</a><br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  It doesn’t matter who they will play, or what surface they will 
                  play on, what matters is how the Russians perform in the Davis 
                  Cup Final, says Marat Safin.<br>
<br>
Neither does it matter how victory against France is achieved. 
                    Safin says they will take a win however it comes - with any 
                    kind of scoreline, however badly they play.<br>
<br>
&quot;Just to win is most important.”<br>
<br>
The countdown has begun in earnest to perhaps the most crucial 
                    week in Russian tennis since Safin overwhelmed Pete Sampras 
                    in the 2000 US Open final to win his first Grand Slam title 
                    and Russia’s third, Yevgeny Kafelnikov accounting for the 
                    other two. While the nation no longer lacks for titles at 
                    the highest level of the game, a Davis Cup title so far remains 
                    beyond its reach, despite consecutive visits to the final 
                    in 1994 and 1995. It is believed that former Russian President 
                    Boris Yeltsin will be at the Palais Omnisports to lend his 
                    support.<br>
<br>
Having completed a week of practise in Monte Carlo that Kafelnikov 
                    says was “productive”, the Russian team has now moved base 
                    to Paris and are staying in the same hotel as their French 
                    rivals. It’s easy to be relaxed together now, says Safin, 
                    ahead of play starting on Friday. Things could get a little 
                    harder then.<br>
<br>
Russia’s Captain Shamil Tarpischev also firmly believes that 
                    his team’s destiny lies in their own hands and not those of 
                    the defending champion: “Everything depends on how the Russian 
                    players play.” <br>
<br>
Denis Golovanov, who is not amongst the Russians' four nominated 
                    players, trained with the squad last week in Monte Carlo and 
                    is continuing to do so in Paris. Mikhail Youzhny – who has 
                    been nominated – has now joined up with the team having missed 
                    last week's camp.<br>
<br>
While others speculate about which of the nominated French 
                    team – Arnaud Clement, Sebastien Grosjean, Nicolas Escude 
                    or Fabrice Santoro – will be put forward for the singles matches, 
                    or even if Guy Forget will replace one of his nominated players 
                    with Paul-Henri Mathieu before the draw on Thursday, Safin 
                    has no strong feelings about who he would prefer to see on 
                    the other side of the net come Friday. <br>
<br>
“They know how to play big matches,” was his succinct assessment.<br>
<br>
“I’m doing everything to play my best tennis over the next 
                    three days,” continued the 22-year-old Russian. <br>
<br>
Losing all three of his matches at the season-ending Tennis 
                    Masters Cup in Shanghai does not appear to have dented Safin’s 
                    confidence now he is back at Bercy, the scene of his recent 
                    title success. In his third visit to the final of the Bercy 
                    event, he blew away world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt, reclaiming 
                    the title he first won two years ago. Paris has been good 
                    to Safin and he feels comfortable here, even if the Davis 
                    Cup Final will be contested on clay rather than carpet.<br>
<br>
Because of Safin’s recent success, Kafelnikov would rather 
                    his younger teammate was drawn to play the first singles rubber, 
                    suggesting that he himself lacks confidence at this stage 
                    and that Safin stands a better chance of scoring the first 
                    point than himself. <br>
<br>
Gamesmanship, perhaps? The enigmatic 28-year-old has had 
                    a disappointing season, finishing the year ranked 27, but 
                    has still collected two titles. He also won his first Grand 
                    Slam title on the clay of Roland Garros in 1996, and has stressed 
                    how much the Davis Cup means to him.<br>
<br>
He has said several times that he will retire after the final 
                    if Russia win, and whatever happens he will undergo an operation 
                    on a varicose vein after the weekend.<br>
<br>
There can be no doubt that Kafelnikov will play a crucial 
                    role in Russia’s fortunes, for better or worse, in the coming 
                    week.<br>
