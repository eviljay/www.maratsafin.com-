                  Monday, 21 January, 2002 <br>
                  <br>
                  Master blaster Marat Safin was the last man into the 2002 Australian 
                  Open quarter finals, after a gripping 6-2 6-4 6-7(5) 7-6(8) 
                  victory over Pete Sampras on Rod Laver Arena, Monday night.<br>
                  <br>
                  This was billed as a battle of heavyweights, as Safin and Sampras 
                  were the only Grand Slam champions. But for the first two sets, 
                  it appeared Pete was fighting way, way above his weight. The 
                  193cm Safin intimidated Sampras with a fearsome first serve, 
                  which the American fended off his chin on a few occasions. The 
                  Russian also tore into Sampras at the net with passing shots 
                  of terrifying pace. Even more impressive than Safin's gob-smacking 
                  power was his composure and the desperation with which he chased 
                  down every ball, even diving at the baseline a few times after 
                  Sampras volleys. <br>
                  <br>
                  As Cyclone Safin blew through to 6-2 6-4 3-1, Sampras, the winner 
                  of a record 13 Grand Slams, was helpless. It was reminiscent 
                  of the straight-sets drubbing Pete had copped in the 2000 US 
                  Open final against the Russian. He'd won just a handful of points 
                  at the net. At the change of ends, he studied his blistered 
                  feet. Sampras even had uncharacteristic exchanges with a heckling 
                  fan. <br>
                  <br>
                  The all-time great showed a lot of heart to get back in the 
                  contest. Also, the cyclone abated. At 4-3, Safin fell behind 
                  15-40 with three loose errors. A rare missed backhand pass put 
                  Sampras back on even terms and, as Marat later reflected, changed 
                  the whole complexion of the match.<br>
                  <br>
                  Sampras won three straight games to take the third into a tiebreak. 
                  There, he led the whole way, seizing his chances on Safin second 
                  serves to pull it out 7-5. The crowd, thrilled to see Sampras 
                  back in the hunt, erupted. Safin, growing visibly frustrated, 
                  engaged in lively discussion with the umpire. But he did little 
                  wrong in the tiebreak, apart from missing a couple of first 
                  serves.<br>
                  <br>
                  By the fourth, Sampras had his teeth well into the match and 
                  looked increasingly dangerous. He fought back from 0-40 to hold 
                  serve in the second game, had break chances on two separate 
                  Safin games and retrieved a 0-30 deficit to take the set to 
                  another tiebreak. Both players were visibly tiring after more 
                  than three hours on court, going blow for desperate blow like 
                  heavyweights in the final round.<br>
                  <br>
                  Leading 4-2 in the tiebreak, Sampras dumped an achievable forehand 
                  volley into the net. The look of anguish said it all. He dropped 
                  a set point at 6-5 on Safin's serve, overcame a match point 
                  with a courageous net raid, then saw another set point go begging 
                  as Safin hit a brave double-fisted backhand for a winner. On 
                  his second match point on the Sampras serve, Safin charged across 
                  court and nailed a desperate forehand pass down the line at 
                  full stretch.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Tough one to lose,&quot; said a subdued Sampras. &quot;I 
                  felt like the momentum was going my way and the crowd definitely 
                  got me more into the match. I was one point away from tying 
                  it all up there (in the fourth set tiebreak). I played the match 
                  points a little bit conservatively. But I've gotta give him 
                  credit. He played phenomenal the first couple of sets - it reminded 
                  me of the (US) Open final a couple of years ago. When he gets 
                  going mentally, he's one of the best out there. Mentally he 
                  can be a little fragile but today he was strong. He kept his 
                  composure when he needed to and played a great match.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Agreed Safin: &quot; I was tough today. I stayed there. I fought. 
                  I didn't expect I could put the forehand down the line (on the 
                  final point). And I made it.&quot; The motivation as he made 
                  that final lunge?: &quot;You never want to play fifth set against 
                  Pete. I saw him for (over) three hours - it's enough for me. 
                  He's too big, too dangerous.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin next faces South African veteran Wayne Ferreira, who overcame 
                  Albert Costa 9-7 in the fifth set. &quot;Great player, very 
                  experienced, very talented,&quot; Safin says. &quot;Definitely 
                  it's going to be very tough.&quot; But Safin enters the quarter 
                  finals with the freshest legs, having conceded just one set 
                  thus far. He is also the only man in the field to lift a Grand 
                  Slam trophy.<br>
                  <br>
                  The towering Russian, who turns 22 the day of the men's final, 
                  is closing on his 2000 form, when he won the US Open, six other 
                  events and came within a whisker of ending the year as No.1. 
                  The reason, says Safin, is he is more mentally together. &quot;Everything 
                  is organised. I had great preparation for this year. Last year 
                  I got injured. I had problems and couldn't find my game. I got 
                  nervous, I was a little bit lost. So I needed to stop and for 
                  two months I just prepared for this year. I'll be dangerous 
                  this year, for sure.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  After tonight's performance, who would argue?<br>
