                    Interview of Marat Safin to French "Tennis" magazine. <br>

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Tennis Magazine : How do you feel at the beginning of this 
                    new year ?<br>
                    Marat Safin : Good, very good actually (smile). I came to 
                    Australia with the only idea to start the year well. That's 
                    all. Despite all what happened to me at the end of the year, 
                    I fell fresh. I'm expecting some tough matches and I know 
                    it won't be easy to get back to it. I'm optimistic. That's 
                    how I am. (smile)<br>
                    <br>
                    TM : Despite you elbow injury that you felt a few days ago 
                    ?<br>
                    MS : It was not really an injury, it's a pain I already felt 
                    in the past, especially in Roland Garros in 1999. Back then, 
                    I had stopped during 4 or 5 days, and I didn't serve during 
                    this period. But here, it's impossible to take some rest or 
                    not to serve 100%. It's the Australian Open, the 1st Grand 
                    Slam, and I don't want to miss it. We'll see. If I break my 
                    elbow, I would have been wrong to play. I do what I can. Between 
                    2 matches, I work with the physio, make ultra-sonics, and 
                    cross my fingers (smile).<br>
                    <br>
                    TM : How did you spend your holiday after the Masters in Lisbon 
                    ?<br>
                    MS : First, they were very short. I can't even say they were 
                    holidays because they were very short. I had to prepare 2001 
                    to go to Australia and play the Hopman Cup in Perth. After 
                    Lisbon, I went in Austria during one week, in San Anton, to 
                    ski. Unfortunately, there were no snow when I got there. So 
                    I did the only thing I really wanted to do : sleep, a lot&#133; 
                    I had fun with my friends who were with me. The last 2 days, 
                    it snowed, so I could learn to stand on skis. (smile)<br>
                    <br>
                    TM : One week of holidays, obviously it is short after the 
                    long season and the big emotions you felt in 2000. Aren't 
                    you afraid of paying the price of this infernal season ?<br>
                    MS : (apparently surprised) No, why ? Come on, I'm 20. I'm 
                    young, I recover fast. If I don't have energy now, I will 
                    never have some. It's better to stop now. A new season is 
                    starting, and I have to forget all what happened last year. 
                    It belongs to the past. So it's better to turn the page and 
                    start something else. Now, I want to concentrate on the present 
                    and future. My goal is to be in the top 5 at the end of the 
                    year and to win another Grand Slam. That's what I'm thinking 
                    of today.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM : Let's get back to the end of the season and the Masters 
                    in Lisbon where Gustavo Kuerten became number 1 instead of 
                    you. Did you feel deep sadness ?<br>
                    MS : Sadness ? I don't think it is the right word. Disappointment, 
                    yes, but not sadness. That's life. There was nothing I could 
                    do. Tennis is a business like the others. It's show business. 
                    At the end, there is a winner and a loser. I lost and the 
                    only thing I could say is congratulations Kuerten.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: If Andre Agassi had beaten Gustavo Kuerten in the final 
                    of the Masters, you would have been number 1. Did you watch 
                    the match on TV?<br>
                    MS: I watched it in Valencia, in Spain. But I already knew 
                    the result. I knew that Kuerten was going to win.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM How did you know?<br>
                    MS: Because it was inevitable. I couldn't seize the opportunity, 
                    but Kuerten did it. It's my fault. Too bad for me, even more 
                    if I never get to be number 1 at the end of a season.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: So you didn't trust Agassi to beat him for you?<br>
                    MS: No, because I never trust anyone. As he had beaten Pete 
                    Sampras in the semi-finals, I knew he would beat<br>
                    Agassi. I cant explain you, but that's the way I felt it. 
                    I was supposed to stay in Lisbon in case I would be number 
                    one, because I would been given a trophy on the court, but 
                    I left. I already knew the result.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: Did you watch the match until the end?<br>
                    MS: Of course. I watched it from the beginning to the end. 
                    Not because I was hoping something, but because it was the 
                    final of the Masters, and I would have watched it even if 
                    I would not have been involved. Believe me: I was not praying 
                    in front of my TV so that something happens for me this day. 
                    I knew it. It was inevitable and that's the way it was. I 
                    had to accept the result.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: What did you lack at the end of the season to become number 
                    1?<br>
                    MS: A little bit of luck, that's all. He had a little bit 
                    more luck than me. During the 3rd set of the semi-final against 
                    Sampras, he managed to save 4 break balls that could have 
                    changed everything for me. If Pete had score a point, I would 
                    be number 1, I'm sure of that. In fact, I relied more on Pete 
                    that on Andre. The only regret I can have is that I was tired 
                    when I came to the Masters. My victory in Bercy (Paris) took 
                    me a lot of energy.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: But still, you were number 1 in the world, the youngest 
                    ever, during 2 weeks (&#133;) Do you think that you were number 
                    1 during these 2 weeks?<br>
                    MS: I think nothing (smile). What do people will remember? 
                    That Kuerten was number 1 in 2000, that's all. I was number 
                    2, that's all I will remember. I'm not satisfied with it believe 
                    me. I won't feel better telling me that I was number 1.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: Even if the holidays were short, did you take time to 
                    think of what you did in 2000?<br>
                    MS: What I did was unexpected, above all if you remember how 
                    I was few months before. It's extraordinary. I won a Grand 
                    Slam, I was number 1 in the world, whereas I was nothing nine 
                    months before, it's not that bad (smile).<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: Let's get back to the beginning of your trouble, during 
                    the Australian Open 2000, when you lost in the 1st round against 
                    Grant Stafford, and when you were fined for tanking. How did 
                    you feel back then?<br>
                    MS: It was a good lesson for me, even if I think that the 
                    umpire exaggerated. I was not feeling good, I was lost. I 
                    was fighting against myself. Actually, I was still very young. 
                    It was like a kick in the backside, and maybe it helped me 
                    to move on. It was a lesson of intelligence, that's all.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: The beginning of the 2000 season was a disaster, that's 
                    the least we can say. What do you put this bad start down 
                    to?<br>
                    MS: I don't even know. One year after, I still don't know 
                    I had no motivation .I was 20, it's not normal. I was playing 
                    without knowing how to play and it was a real disaster.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: Where the rumors about early retirement true?<br>
                    MS: It was serious. I didn't like tennis anymore. I told my 
                    manager that if I was not in the top 100 at the end of the 
                    year, I would stop. And I meant it. What's the point of losing 
                    your time and money?<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: Back then, did you ask your mother, who was your coach 
                    at the beginning, for advice?<br>
                    MS: (sharply) There were no reason for me to ask her anything. 
                    I'm responsible of what I'm doing. It matters little what 
                    people think, especially my mother.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: In Monte-Carlo, it seemed that you had conceded a more 
                    important defeat than all the others. Why?<br>
                    MS: I had the feeling that it couldn't be worse and that I 
                    had to do something to stop it. So I decided to change my 
                    coach. I had the courage to take that decision because it 
                    was hard to take, but I did not regret it.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: Back then, did you feel sad about your game?<br>
                    MS: Sadness, again!! (energetic). I'm not a woman: Sadness 
                    is for woman. I was irritated, but not sad. I realized that 
                    I was going in the wrong way and I managed to get back to 
                    the right one. I knew that I made the right choice because 
                    I won in Barcelona the week after.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: Rafael Mensua have been your coach since you came to Spain 
                    when you were 13. Wasn't it hard to tell him that it was over?<br>
                    MS: It was not a nice moment, but we had to go through it. 
                    He was not surprised with my decision because everything was 
                    going wrong. I told you : tennis is a business. When things 
                    don't work, you have to say stop, even if you have to say 
                    it to people you like.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: Then you had 3 others coaches: Andrei Chesnokov, Tony 
                    Pickard, and Alexander Volkov. What did you learn from them?<br>
                    MS: Chesnokov taught me to think and work better. He told 
                    me I had to fight, and above all to listen to him. It was 
                    like in school. I started to listen to him because I respected 
                    him, and I realized that what he said was true. To prove it, 
                    I won the tournament in Barcelona. He didn't change my technique, 
                    he just gave me good advice and my career started again.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: It was a surprise that, despite your good results with 
                    Chesnokov, you decided to stop working with him after Roland 
                    Garros. Why?<br>
                    MS: He didn't want to travel. So it was impossible to go on 
                    with him. But I respected his decision. I understood it. He 
                    has a family and enough money so that he does not travel from 
                    one country to the other with me.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: After Chesnokov, there was Tony Pickard until Wimbledon&#133;<br>
                    MS: It lasted 2 weeks, but it was a great pleasure to work 
                    with such a coach. He taught me 2 or 3 important things to 
                    play on grass. He could not travel either, but we call each 
                    others sometimes. He watches some of my matches on TV, and 
                    we exchange information.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: During the US Open, you were with Alexander Volkov&#133;<br>
                    MS: With Volkov, there is nothing to learn. You just have 
                    to watch him. His tennis is from another planet! When he was 
                    in the circuit, he was not a player like the others. During 
                    the training, it was the same. You watch him and try to understand 
                    if you can. He does what he wants with the ball. And you just 
                    have to try to do the same (laugher). But he has his business 
                    in Russia, and we couldn't go on together. Like for Chesnokov, 
                    I understood. I understand he has other priorities than me.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: Why did you get back with Rafael Mensua and leave him 
                    again after the Masters in Lisbon?<br>
                    MS: It was my decision, it didn't work. I wasn't respecting 
                    him as a coach. During the years, he because like a 2nd father 
                    for me, that is not what I needed As I said, in business, 
                    you don't have feelings. I thought that it was stupid to go 
                    on with something that was not good only because I was working 
                    with someone very close. <br>
                    <br>
                    TM: How is Marat Safin's ideal coach?<br>
                    MS: But I'm not looking for a coach! Everybody talk to me 
                    about it because everybody think that when you are 20, you 
                    need a coach. I don't think so. I think I know what I need 
                    and what I have to do, even if I'm wrong. People are trying 
                    to give me a bad reputation. People think I'm wearing out 
                    coaches the one after the others. In my life, I only had 3 
                    coaches: my mother, Rafael and Chesnokov. All the others were 
                    friends that wanted to work with me. I'm here in Australia 
                    with Andrei Merinov. He is here because he is my friend. It 
                    turns out that he plays good tennis and that he can hit the 
                    ball with me. I'm not asking for more.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: Do you still listen to your mother's advice?<br>
                    MS: (seems disgusted) No, I left home too early. Far from 
                    my family during all these years, I grew up faster than the 
                    other people of my age. She can give me advice if she wants, 
                    but I don't listen to her. I know that I owe her a lot for 
                    the beginning, but now I have to take my own decisions, even 
                    if they are bad.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: Does she still live in Valencia not far from you?<br>
                    MS: She lives in Valencia with my sister, but since 5 months, 
                    I've been living in Monaco. I still have a place to live in 
                    Valencia to see them sometimes.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: When do you think about your victory in the US Open, what 
                    are the images that you have in your mind?<br>
                    MS: It was nice, but I have already turned the page. And it's 
                    not enough. It's only the beginning. There are a lot of other 
                    tournaments to win during the next 10 years maybe. That's 
                    past. Make way to the present and future.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: Did you watch your final against Pete Sampras?<br>
                    MS: No, I don't like watching videos of my matches. And I 
                    know this final by heart. I could almost tell you what were 
                    the points the one after the others. (pointing his finger 
                    on his head). It's in here!<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: What about your trophy? Where is it? In Monaco or Valencia?<br>
                    MS: It's in my manager's office in Monaco. I didn't take it 
                    because it is too heavy. It's better this way.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: Bill Clinton called you after your victory in New York. 
                    What about Vladimir Putin?<br>
                    MS: He sent me a telegram. He didn't have time to meet me. 
                    He has more important things to do. But I kept the paper to 
                    show it later to my children.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: You often say that Roland Garros is the tournament you 
                    absolutely want to win. Why?<br>
                    MS: It is my goal this year, it will be my goal until I win 
                    this tournament. I love this place. I think it is wonderful. 
                    Everything is beautiful in Roland Garros. It's like a &quot;big 
                    party&quot;. The public knows the game very well. They know 
                    what a good point is, and they are quiet when it is necessary. 
                    And I love Paris. It is a beautiful city with very good restaurants 
                    (smile). For me , Roland Garros is like Disneyland. And it's 
                    where my career started.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: It seemed that you were doing good last year. But you 
                    lost against Norman in quarter final. What happened?<br>
                    MS: There were too much tennis for me the weeks before the 
                    tournament. I was exhausted. In quarter final, I didn't react 
                    the way I should, but I couldn't do anything. My legs were 
                    telling me that it was over. Against Norman, I was playing 
                    without knowing what to do. My brain exploded. This year, 
                    I promise, I won't play so much before Roland Garros.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: On the whole, you played a lot in 2000. Do you think it 
                    will be the same this year?<br>
                    MS: The problem is that last year, I didn't know that I was 
                    going to play so many matches. Who could have told it? For 
                    sure, I couldn't. My goal was to be in the top 20, not to 
                    fight to be number 1. During the 3 first months, I only won 
                    one match, and suddenly, I couldn't stop winning. Excluding 
                    the Davis Cup, I played 30 tournaments. It's too much. In 
                    2001, I will try to play less. Reduce quantity to increase 
                    quality. And because of all these tournaments, sometimes I 
                    felt less pleasure . I don't want this to happen again.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: Is tennis still a game for you?<br>
                    MS: It was a game when I was 9 or 10. Now it's my job, but 
                    I like it. Thanks to my parents to have pushed me as they 
                    did when I was younger, otherwise, I would have had no future 
                    in this game. I've never liked my life so much than today, 
                    all this pleasure is thanks to tennis.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: Do you think you will win Wimbledon one day?<br>
                    MS: Last year, I learned a lot thanks to Tony Pickard. I think 
                    that one day I will have a chance, but I need time. It's possible, 
                    I m' sure. <br>
                    <br>
                    TM: Where is the Davis Cup in your priorities?<br>
                    MS: Very high. Russia deserves to win the Davis Cup. But the 
                    draws are awful this year. First, we have to play in Slovakia. 
                    Then, if we win, we have to do to Sweden or Czech Republic. 
                    It couldn't be worse. To win the Davis Cup, we need luck. 
                    Look at Spain last year. They played all the matches in Spain 
                    on clay. But with Kafelnikov, we can win in 2001.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: What kind of relation do you have with Yevgeny Kafelnikov?<br>
                    MS: Everything is fine. We both like casinos (laugher)<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: Is it easy for you to walk in peace in the streets of 
                    Moscow?<br>
                    MS: No problem! We're not in America! In the USA, people can 
                    become crazy, with Agassi for example. In Russia, it's more 
                    relax. You're a person just like the others.<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: In the United States, you often complain about the question 
                    you are asked about Russia. Why?<br>
                    MS: In the USA, they always exaggerate. They talk about Russia 
                    without knowing what really happens in the country. Russia 
                    is bad. What's so bad? They show people in the streets, who 
                    only have one leg. Why not showing New York and the Bronx? 
                    It's not better. That's America!<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: How do you explain the good results of young Russian players?<br>
                    MS: More and more courts are built in the country. People 
                    like tennis. Just see the success of the Kremlin Cup in Moscow. 
                    There have already been a boom with Chesnokov and Volkov. 
                    With Kafelnikov and I, everything is going faster. The Americans 
                    are not the only ones to play tennis (laugher)<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: Among the good players, there is your sister, Dinara, 
                    that you watched in Roland Garros last year where she played 
                    the junior tournament. Where is she up to?<br>
                    MS: I'm surprised but also scared by her tennis. She can play 
                    very well. But I think she takes things too seriously. She 
                    is a little bit too professional She is only 15 and she should 
                    see it more as a game. <br>
                    <br>
                    TM: Do you still give her advice?<br>
                    MS: yes, but she doesn't listen to me (laugher)<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: We know that you love cars. How many cars do you have?<br>
                    MS: 3!<br>
                    <br>
                    TM: No accident yet?<br>
                    MS: No!! (burst of laugh). I'm really cautious (seeking for 
                    a piece of wood to touch) <br>
