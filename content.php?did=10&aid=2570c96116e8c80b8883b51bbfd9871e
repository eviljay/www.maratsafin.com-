You come to a little Ukrainian restaurant next to Tsvetnoy Boulevard to have lunch without a tape recorder and a notebook, you look at the table next to you and suddenly see Marat Safin.<SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>You get slightly surprised - this place is nice but it’s nothing ultra fashionable. As any regular person I would think people of such calibre should go to ‘special’ places but Safin is here, quietly having a bite to eat in a very regular restaurant (for the most curious readers I state that Marat was alone and not drinking alcohol). The tennis player, who has grown a lot of hair and a little beard recently, is polite with waiters and talks to them in a half-whispering manner not wanting to be noticed.</FONT></SPAN></SPAN></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Your journalistic nature tells you - you cannot let this chance slip! It doesn’t matter that Safin is known for his unfriendly attitude towards journalists and that you mainly write about football only watching tennis simply as a spectator. But then again Safin likes football too - he once said in an interview that he dreams about ‘Spartak’s’ victory in the Champions League and in June, 2005 he rushed from his tournament in Munchengladbach <SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</SPAN>for just one night to watch a Russia-Germany match and after that he visited the changing room of our team. Behavioural norms were not violated by a Sport Express journalist - I waited until Safin finished his meal, went up and introduced myself and got an agreement to do an interview right away. Three days later instead of the pre-agreed 30 minutes we spoke for an hour and a half. And the winner of US Open 2000, Australian Open 2005 and Davis Cup 2002 turned out to be a rather natural and open young man.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Luckily, my body allows me not to be afraid of that. I have only gained two kilos since I stopped playing, now I weigh 95 kilos instead of 93.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Oh, please! I go to this Ukrainian restaurant 3-4 times a week and a friend of mine owns it. Every restaurant of this chain has a huge box for donations, which are used to buy hospital equipment. Once he was skiing in Switzerland and broke his arm really badly. He turned to a doctor named Sergey Arkhipov, who literally put his hand together piece by piece. To thank the doctor my friend came up with this idea. Not so long ago with this money a hospital bought equipment worth 130 thousand euros.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>As for the status, I cannot stand the word ‘celebrity’ and anything that it might imply. It’s total nonsense. When someone calls a person a celebrity, it’s like they are trying to turn him into a robot. And I am a human being.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>If everything turns out how the doctors promised, I will start running slowly in two weeks, then in December I will slowly start putting some additional pressure on my body, no weightlifting or anything serious like that. My goal is to pick up good form for the Australian Open where I have a lot of ranking points to defend. I don’t know whether I will have enough time. I am still not allowed to do anything like run, do sharp movements. Even going up the stairs I have to be extremely careful. It’s cold today and my knee hurts. This is a permanent injury and I will never be able to completely get rid of it.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Torn fibres around the kneecap. All pressure passes through these fibres. I played injured for 6 months. I played Roland Garros after painkilling injections of up to 1400/1600 milligrams. It helped at the time but it was impossible not to limp after a match.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Yes. This is the same way I won matches in Wimbledon. There my leg would only take two matches.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><STRONG>Do you regret playing injured for so long?</STRONG></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>I had something very similar five years ago. Every time I changed the surface, my knee was hurting and then in a couple of weeks it used to pass. I thought the pain would go away. It started to really hurt during Indian Wells. I was hoping it would be better when we moved to clay. It wasn’t. But I couldn’t get a proper cure - Roland Garros was ahead, Super 9 tournaments in Hamburg and Rome, Wimbledon. You have to play while you can, you cannot escape from it. However, after London I just couldn’t anymore.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><STRONG>So you went to Italy to get treatment?</STRONG></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Yes. I had calculated that I could afford missing tournaments for a month/a month and a half. However I obviously rushed out before it was time.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><o:p><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></o:p></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><STRONG>Why obviously?</STRONG></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Two reasons. First of all, I had to play, to defend points. US Open was coming up and I had to gain form. In tennis one thing leads to another, it’s like a circle, which you cannot get out from. And even though I had been warned that I had to stay and get treatment for another 2-3 weeks, I took a decision and left. I got on court and ‘finished myself off’. It would be best now to make the treatment a little longer but Australian Open starts in January and I am the defending champion. I will already be out of the top 10 at the beginning of next year and if, in addition to that, I will play badly during this tournament, then I will not be seeded at large tournaments. I cannot allow that to happen even though right now I totally realise that my form in Melbourne will not be super. I will only start playing then.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3></FONT></SPAN>&nbsp;</P><SPAN lang=ES>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><STRONG>Let’s get back to your rushing out, what was the second reason?</STRONG></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>There is a huge difference between getting treatment in Moscow and in an unknown city. I knew no one in Bologna and stayed at the hotel. I wanted to howl I was so sick at heart. I hardly speak Italian and then there was this moment when I felt an urge to play. All in all, I couldn’t take it anymore there. I told the doctors I could not stand it any longer and went to Moscow, to my friends and family. And then I returned to court too soon.</FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><o:p><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>&nbsp;</FONT></o:p></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><STRONG>Do you still go to Italy?</STRONG></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>No, I go to a health centre near Kurskaya tube station. They have great specialists there, once in 2 weeks they fixed my hand, which had already made me miss 8 months of tennis. I trust them completely. A diagnosis was the same from everyone – Italians, Americans and our doctors. I had people coming up to me and saying - there is this fantastic doctor, he knows how to cure you. How the hell does this so called doctor know anything if we haven’t even met?</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Life has been teaching me to recognise people like that. I make mistakes sometimes but on the whole I am becoming an expert.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3><STRONG>Have you thought of having surgery especially considering that it’s a permanent injury?</STRONG></FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>I would have had to miss a whole year. I will be 27 in 2007. Plus I would have to go through hell- crutches, therapy. I think that I won’t be able to return to tennis after this.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>Yes, I criticised them. We play non-stop for 11 months a year. We have one month to rest and get ready for the next season. How can we talk about health, rest and personal life? And the system is made in such a way that you have to play tournaments all year round. You cannot take a two week break if you are tired. And tennis balls change every time. Can you imagine football players having to play with balls of different weight all the time? Yes, I am in this business and I don’t want to die. But in addition to that I want to be healthy and I don’t want my colleagues to receive numerous injuries in one year.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>No, you won’t, it does. Not even a well-trained person can handle this pressure. That’s why by 30 most players retire.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>To those people, who think that way I would like to remind them that tennis is my life and my business. All that I have, I owe it to tennis. And I treat my business just the same way as let’s say a chairman of the bank treats his. Will he go to work with a headache and swollen face suffering from a hangover? Neither will I, I cannot abuse something, which is the basis of my lifestyle. And then I play for Russia and not for some Thai Pei, where no one even watches tennis. Here they notice these things right away. </FONT></SPAN></P>
<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>I am already 25 and not 18 when I could have gone out to play after a party and treated tennis differently. Knowing what kind of money I earn people tend to think that I party every night and don’t give a damn about tennis. This point of view is not only stupid but it is also an insult to me. It is very unpleasant to communicate with people who think like that. It means that this person is ‘spitting in my face’ thinking that I am just lucky because I have the talent. How many of these same talents weren’t able to remain in professional tennis! Take Marcelo Rios for example. When he worked - he was the first, then he stopped taking the business seriously and had to leave. And if I treated tennis in the same manner I would not be around. It was ten years ago that you could reach a final of a serious tournament with just your serve. Now everyone has impeccable preparation, everyone has a whole team behind him. You get into the changing room and look at these guys shirtless and get an impression that you have come to a bodybuilding contest, that’s how much time people spend in gyms with their fitness coaches. You won’t get far with just talent nowadays!</FONT></SPAN></P>

He dug foundation pits for skyscrapers by hand and built the first tube stations. He lived through the whole war and was wounded twice.

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>They are very demanding and that is why it is rather difficult for me to play in Moscow. But nonetheless Russian supporters like me more than the Brits like Henman, who has been hated in London because he cannot win Wimbledon. But everyone forgets that there was no one in England like him for a 100 years! So in comparison to him I have nothing to complain about. I feel that in Russia I am no longer considered as a ‘spoilt by fate’ brat that doesn’t care about anything. Now I walk along the street, go into shops and I hear ‘Get well Marat!’ That’s nice. And when little kids pull their mums’ dresses and whisper ‘Mummy, do you know who this is?’ - it really gets to me. That is why when they ask me to visit Tver or Kazan in order to attract kids to tennis I go without thinking twice.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>I do not like this tournament. One of the reasons is a totally disastrous sportsmen treatment. Here’s an example. We get 20 pounds for lunch. I have a coach and a masseuse and one portion of the most uneatable spaghetti costs 12 pounds, a portion of tasteless strawberries with cream from a sachet costs 5 pounds, coffee - another 5. The rest of the food is horrible - fish and chips everywhere and hamburgers. I can pay myself of course. What’s really unappealing is disrespect. How can you give such a treatment to people, who waste lots of health and strength earning tons of money for the organisers? Wimbledon’s profit alone is around 60 milliom pounds!</FONT></SPAN></P>

In 2001 I was in the quarterfinals, I played really well this year and would have got further than two rounds if it wasn’t for the knee. In Halle I almost beat Federer in the final on grass. It is another thing that it is very hard for me to switch from clay to grass, I don’t have time to get used to it. But the surface has nothing to do with it. Only for supporters is Wimbledon traditions and promotion but Wimbledon for players is horrible treatment.</FONT></SPAN></P>

<P class=MsoNormal style="MARGIN: 0cm 0cm 0pt"><SPAN lang=ES><FONT face="Times New Roman" size=3>US Open. There are constant transport problems to get to the stadium and back. Food is unbearable as well - you get dried pizza, which has been lying around for about 5 hours, coffee is black water. And after September 11 the police have become animalistic - they are everywhere, questioning you at the entrance to the stadium, if you say something wrong you will be taken to police headquarters. You’re forced to take shoes and even shorts off at the airport, they’re really rude to you. This makes me go mad. Only New York itself saves the situation - it’s a fantastic city. I usually live nowhere near the majority of players. Old districts have really wonderful places, which the others don’t know about yet.</FONT></SPAN></P>

But this is not the reason I played badly in both my Olympics. I came to Sydney after I had won both the US Open and Tashkent tournament, I had no strength. Athens had horrible conditions. All tennis players were devastated. We played with balls, which you can easily buy in the cheapest supermarket. Courts were coloured in such a way that we could hardly see the ball.

I lost on the very first day but stayed there until the end of the Olympics and never went outside the village it was so great there! Tons of fun! It was all different in Athens. There was barb wire all around the village. I had the Israeli team as neighbours and people with machine guns used to guard them, I felt uncomfortable. No grass underneath your feet, they had built bungalows on bare soil. I think Olympic sportsmen deserve better than that. </FONT></SPAN></P>
