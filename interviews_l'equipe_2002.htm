                Marat Safin interview by Dominique Bonnot<br>
                    <br>
<br>
                    <em>Marat Safin little concerned the introspection, evokes 
                    his life, its differences and its ambitions<br>
                    A t almost 23 years, Marat Safin is one of the most charismatic 
                    persons of the professional circuit. At the same moment talented, 
                    modest, ambitious and captivating, he cultivates the originality 
                    by asserting preferring to give priority to its life rather 
                    than to its profession. He wants to be allowed free above 
                    all and, whatever is approached subject, he leaves with the 
                    others the care of judging.<br>
                    </em><br>
                    <strong>Remember your Davis Cup's first meeting, face Andre 
                    Agassi and Jim Courier, in Atlanta in 1998. It seems that 
                    you finished completely depressed ?</strong><br>
<br>
&quot;Not depressed&quot; . Word is too strong. It is a 
                    little bit hard because it was necessary to reconstruct a 
                    team after Volkov and Chesnokov's pensions. As Andrei Cherkasov 
                    was not in shape Chamil Tarpichtchev had decided to launch 
                    a small new, I, by thinking especially in future. I was 18 
                    years old, I was 190∞ world and I was afraid. I was afraid 
                    of being in this team. First week one got ready in Miami, 
                    in the &quot;Fontainebleau&quot; , and that was great. Big 
                    luxury. I had a personal room, not need to share with whoever, 
                    and I trained well . Then I began less well to feel because 
                    you have no right to take 6-0,6-0 , 6-0 against Agassi when 
                    you represent your country ! Finally I managed a little to 
                    relax. I lost but without making a bad contest. Agassi played 
                    too fast for me.<br>
                    In double (with Kafelnikov), one did not wait big for matter 
                    of me considering my lack experience, and they were right 
                    because I managed to serve and to return. Finally, the third 
                    day arrived, in front of Courier for the decisive match. I 
                    knew that Courier played although in the past and, for the 
                    first time of my life I said myself that I had a chance to 
                    beat a lad as him. I win first set 6-0, then I lead 4-1 , 
                    40-30 in the second; and there I feel at one go completely 
                    oppressed by striking a smash. I was formed in Spain, on clay, 
                    and volley is not my strong point. At the time, as soon as 
                    I went to the net, I failed, or I took myself a passing or 
                    a winning lob. It is like that, that I lost 6-4 in the fifth 
                    set. But it was a big experience, and rather positive, because 
                    I realized that I would have been able to win this contest. 
                    I became aware at the same time of my gaps and my possibilities. 
                    I did not cry, even though I was a little bit sad. For the 
                    first time, I received some money in Davis Cup, and especially 
                    from this meeting, I began really to trust me. Right after 
                    that, I reached two finales of Challengers. I obtained a wild 
                    card in Barcelona where I beat Larsson and Novak et cetera 
                    until Roland Garros where I beat Agassi then Kuerten, titleholder.<br>
<br>
                    <strong>You had a desire for revenge against Agassi ?</strong><br>
<br>
Then, because I had tried such a feeling impotence in front 
                    of him as I wondered : &quot; How can you make to manage to 
                    resist to him? &quot; I did not have anything to lose, then 
                    I ran, ran, I held all that I was able to and I eventually 
                    won.<br>
<br>
                    <strong>Do you think that this meeting Atlanta was the beginning 
                    of a history of which you go to know outcome this weekend 
                    in finale against France ?</strong><br>
<br>
Not really, at the time my dream was to go into the top 100. 
                    It was that priority objective, not Davis Cup. I didnТt care 
                    about it at all, in fact. I thought just of progressing, and 
                    of living my life, by knowing that if I arrived there it would 
                    indeed be for the team but consequently.<br>
                    It was the first time in Atlanta that you are next to Yevgueni 
                    Kafelnikov...<br>
                    Yes the first time. But in fact, one had not enormously spoken. 
                    I was shy, I didnТt know anybody, and I had no money to follow 
                    the others. I stayed in my hotel but it was nice all the same.<br>
<br>
                    <strong>You spoke about some money that you had had the occasion 
                    to win in Davis Cup. You play today Davis Cup only for the 
                    honor either also for the money ?</strong><br>
<br>
It is not at all question of money in this finale of Davis 
                    Cup. We want to win it, and it is my unique motivation. One 
                    plays for our country, and for ourselves. Of some money one 
                    has many other occasions to win it. Davis Cup, it is something 
                    that you can not buy. If you want it, it is necessary to win 
                    it.<br>
                    &quot; Kafelnikov has his friends I have mine &quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
                    <strong>Did you make a pact with Kafelnikov because it will 
                    withdraw later finale ?</strong><br>
<br>
No, at all ! He has his life, I have mine. We are not so 
                    close as that one of the other one. We havenТt the same age, 
                    or the same past. We are two persons diametrically opposite. 
                    That is why, it is difficult to communicate. We make the same 
                    job, it is Davis Cup, it would be fantastic for the tennis 
                    in Russia which one wins, and one is both to give our maximum. 
                    But when business is ended, one says himself &quot;ciao&quot; 
                    and one leaves each of our quoted. One always greets itself, 
                    if one has the occasion to meet itself in the same evening 
                    no problems but he has his friends, I have mine.<br>
<br>
                    <strong>Are not you afraid that after the pension people focus 
                    even more on you ?</strong><br>
<br>
No, I donТt think. I hate being the centre of all the attentions 
                    and to play &quot; the new star of Russia &quot; does not 
                    tempt me at all. Evgueni, it is really he the star !<br>
<br>
>And for ever, considering what he carried out. I want to 
                    continue to play tennis, to take what it is possible to take 
                    and it is all ! It isnТt only &quot; tennis, tennis, tennis 
                    &quot;. When I shall stop, people will forget me.<br>
                    <strong><br>
                    A lot of people tries to get involved in your life. Do you 
                    accept it more easily now than you are more ripe ? </strong><br>
<br>
Yes but people spend time all the same sending me to the 
                    face all that I should not make my life and my career. They 
                    explain to me at what time I should to go to bed, at what 
                    time it would be necessary that I wake up, how to get dressed, 
                    what to eat, how to improve my forehand, how to change my 
                    backhand, to rise, not rise... That tires me! Then, I try 
                    simply to live my life, to make my work of the best possible, 
                    by choosing that I consider the best for me, and here is.<br>
                    &quot; I did not see for anybody that for myself &quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    <strong>But you live it better than in the past ?</strong><br>
<br>
Yes because now I answer. That does not please everybody 
                    moreover. But it is my life, and I make it of it whom I want. 
                    I did not see for anybody that for myself.<br>
<br>
                    <strong>You produce of the big tennis when you succeed in 
                    disregarding besides. Of what do you need to create this absolute 
                    state of concentration?</strong><br>
<br>
What I need? I donТt know about it anything... If, you need 
                    to be satisfied with you. You have to fell who you are, and 
                    how is your game... On what you can lean and what you have 
                    to improve. You must know exactly what your game looks like. 
                    And it is everything. Later you have only to be allowed go. 
                    To avoid putting itself too much pressure. Because if you 
                    feel too much pressure, if everybody repeats you that it is 
                    necessary that you win 5 tournaments Grand Slam and at least 
                    15 Masters Series, automatically, you put yourself pressure 
                    and you can not play tennis any more. You try, you re-try, 
                    but that does not work any more at all. Then you get excited 
                    even more. Not really best, to reach this state of concentration 
                    it is to manage to be relaxed. Then only you play well and 
                    victory is in the rear and you are happy.<br>
<br>
                    <strong>Have you the inmost conviction to be a world number 
                    1 potential ?</strong><br>
<br>
But IТm not the best player of the world ! I was but it was 
                    long ago, two years ago. It is not any more of current events, 
                    I am number 3.<br>
<br>
                    <strong>But imagine sincerely you to be able to become again 
                    n∞1? </strong><br>
<br>
(Bothered, he sigh for a long time) Mouais ! I believe it. 
                    But it is hard to judge itself. Well on, I hope for all my 
                    heart. But if I say : &quot; yes I believe that I can become 
                    again n∞1 world &quot; and that IТm not him in the next months, 
                    the fellows are going to spend time wondering &quot; Well, 
                    then that comes ? &quot; And I shall feel a shape of pressure. 
                    All that I can say, it is that I have the feeling that my 
                    best years are in front of me. That I intend really to make 
                    all which is in my power to seize all the occasions which 
                    will appear to become again n∞1. And if I do not arrive there 
                    that will not be the end of the world. It would be pity, obviously, 
                    but it is necessary to know how to be satisfied with what 
                    one has. And I shall add a thing : it doesn't much matter 
                    the number of tournaments of the Grand Slam which I shall 
                    take away. Because anyway, everybody will say that I would 
                    have been able to win much more! Nobody of it thought that 
                    I would be capable of winning an only Grand Slam. But since 
                    I won the US OPEN, everybody writes that I should have it 
                    to win the others.<br>
<br>
                    <strong>It is maybe because of Open of Australia this year. 
                    You played magnificently and then in finale against Johansson, 
                    more anything...</strong><br>
<br>
You canТt play a tennis of dream every day like that to order. 
                    I put myself too much pressure. Everybody did not stop repeating 
                    me: &quot; You have to win &quot; , &quot; You have to win 
                    &quot; all day, from morning till night. Then I eventually 
                    believed in it and I have to begin to repeat : &quot; I have 
                    to win &quot;... But I had an opponent, Thomas Johansson. 
                    It is a great player when he is for the top. He beat Agassi 
                    in finale in Montreal, it isnТt a bad. In front of him this 
                    day there when I entered on the court, I was super stretched 
                    out. Because it was my birthday and because I did not want 
                    to lose the day of my birthday. I had full of tricks suck 
                    it and I am been supposed to be in quoted. Here we are, and 
                    there, I was really depressed in the end. It is the biggest 
                    stupidity that I committed of my life : the fact of being 
                    put in me so much pressure hard shoulders. But at the same 
                    time life continues. All this belongs henceforth to the past 
                    and I can not more make anything for it, at the really, I 
                    am on that one day this experience will serve me. It is the 
                    lesson that I learnt in my expense but an important lesson.<br>
                    &quot; We the Russians are different &quot;<br>
<br>
                    <strong>When you had beaten Pete Sampras in finale of the 
                    US OPEN, you had entered on the court the skin of a winner...</strong><br>
<br>
Yes I know but there that did not work. What may I make for 
                    it? To be more relaxed. OK but how ? &quot; Be more positive 
                    &quot; OK ? And what of the other one ? &quot; You get excited 
                    for nothing &quot; OK. You can say itself these things there 
                    on the court there are without unverifiable things. Agassi 
                    when he loses against Gomez in Roland Garros's finale (1990) 
                    it is not a question of tennis, it is because he was not mentally 
                    prepared. <br>
<br>
                    But, 10 years later, he is still all the same the best player 
                    of the world, one of the best at least. Not really only solution 
                    consists in not taking too much itself and to work conscientiously.<br>
Physically also... <br>
<br>
But when shall I be able to work physically ? I have no time 
                    ! Since the US Open I did not stop ! Normally I had to make 
                    before Open of Australia, but with Davis Cup, it is not going 
                    to be possible. Because I need at least two weeks of holidays 
                    : to put the racket, to relax me, to take advantage of the 
                    life. I shall have no time to prepare 2003. I shall work between 
                    two tournaments, my physics, my technique and all which I 
                    need to be capable of becoming again n∞1 world (big smile).<br>
<br>
                    <strong>Can you explain why while you obtained very good results 
                    with Chesnokov, who led you hardly, you prefer henceforth 
                    fellow travellers to inflexible coaches?</strong><br>
<br>
In this time of my life, I was at the edge of the abyss. 
                    I had no more the other solutions to take out me of it that 
                    to execute orders. But I am two years old more, I travelled 
                    a lot, I acquired a lot of experience, I understood how's 
                    that worked. Then business it is well but priority in my life. 
                    I know what I need, at least, not of somebody who says to 
                    me permanently what I have to make. Regrettably we are to 
                    leave with Andrei and since it's true, I watch to keep a certain 
                    autonomy. I find that to have somebody on the back permanently 
                    on the back it is stressful and tiring.<br>
<br>
                    <strong>How it was case with your first coach Rafael Mensua 
                    ?</strong><br>
<br>
No, with him it was different. We had become too close. He 
                    was as my brother. I knew him since very for a long time, 
                    and it is a little of my fault if one separated ; I had grown, 
                    I wanted to steal my own wings.<br>
<br>
                    <strong>Tell us about a little of experience Wilander....</strong><br>
<br>
We, the Russians, have really a very special mentality. As 
                    human beings we are &quot;different&quot; . It is because 
                    of the communism. One had a childhood which has nothing of 
                    common with those of the others. One did not see the same 
                    cartoons.<br>
<br>
                    <strong>Even you, you feel it so ?</strong><br>
<br>
Yes, I was 10 years old all the same when the country changed 
                    politics. It is the reason for which one has so much evil 
                    to be worked with foreigners. Kafelnikov knew success with 
                    Larry Stefanski, but most of the time, they do not understand 
                    our mentality. They do not understand our necessities. That 
                    works one moment, and then there is as a small grain of sand 
                    which puts itself in cogs, and which makes that that doesnТt 
                    work any more.<br>
<br>
                    <strong>Could you describe us this Russian &quot;difference&quot;?</strong><br>
<br>
No IТm incapable of it. I know how in no way to analyze phenomenon 
                    in the detail. I know that that arrives all the time, it is 
                    everything. Various mentalities, various lives, various manners 
                    to react. How to explain it ? I am not Sigmund Freud !<br>
<br>
                    <strong>You often say that it is necessary for you to choose 
                    between the business and the pleasure but which pleasure do 
                    you find in the business ?</strong><br>
<br>
I have really a beautiful life. I travel from a city to the 
                    other one by playing tennis. I return happy people, I have 
                    friends everywhere. Tennis, I see it as a sort of small world, 
                    rather nice. I make a profession by dream which is not maybe 
                    as easy as people imagine. They think that as soon as you 
                    stopped playing, you it steal sweet. It is not completely 
                    case. There is full of thing around the contests people of 
                    which have no idea : gym, massages, interviews, movements... 
                <br>
<br>
                    <strong>On the court you like sharing your feelings with the 
                    public. You make it spontaneously or because you feel that 
                    people wait for it ?</strong><br>
<br>
Generally, I make it naturally, by pleasure, for myself. 
                    But sometimes when there isnТt anything, when a contest is 
                    a little bit boring, I make a small funny trick which a little 
                    wakes the public. People paid to come to see itself, it is 
                    all the same the least things to give them something in exchange.<br>
