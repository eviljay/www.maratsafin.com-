                  <i>Pro tennis. That's the one where you devote your entire life 
                  to training and playing, day in, day out, to the exclusion of 
                  all else, right? Marat Safin - singles guy - begs to differ.

                  <br>
                  Marat Safin is vicarious living for lads. There's his instant-gratification 
                  power game - wham bam, thank you linesmen. The regular raquet 
                  game - 48 frames in his &quot;best&quot; year. The back-chatting 
                  to umpires and crashing of tournament courtesy cars. Last but 
                  not least, the bevy of barely dressed blondes at the Australian 
                  Open who looked like they were auditioning for Boogie Nights 
                  II. Don't you want his life? <br>
                  <br>
                  Stories about Safin? Yeah, sure, say the tour functionaries, 
                  let us get back to you with some printable ones. Safin travels 
                  with a floating cast of characters, not all of them wholesome. 
                  He claims to practise two hours a day tops and spend the rest 
                  of his time frequenting beaches, movie theatres, nightclubs 
                  and restaurants. Handsome, famous, talented and a multimillionaire, 
                  Safin feasts from life's head table. &quot;Good or bad,&quot; 
                  he says, &quot;I try to eat everything.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  If only Safin's lust for the game matched his love for life. 
                  The 22-year-old Muscovite could make life very interesting for 
                  world No 1 Lleyton Hewitt. Post-Wimbledon, Pat Rafter pronounced 
                  Hewitt the Tiger Woods of tennis, a stand-out favourite in every 
                  tournament he contests. If there's one player who threatens 
                  Hewitt's dominance, who has the weapons to blast him off the 
                  court, knock off his US Open crown this month and install himself 
                  as No 1, it's the enigmatic Russian. If he ever gets his head 
                  together. Granted, that's a very big &quot;if&quot;. <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin is a 193cm colossus who would look at home guarding the 
                  Kremlin, Kalashnikov in hand. Except that he'd probably be pointing 
                  it at his own foot. The world No 2 has inherited Goran Ivanisevic's 
                  mantle as tennis's favourite multiple-personality. You never 
                  know which Marat's going to show. There's Safin the intimidating, 
                  who plays ennis with a vapour trail. And there's Safin the exasperating, 
                  who sinks to desultory defeat. Take the Australian Open final 
                  last January. After whacking Sampras in the fourth round, Safin 
                  sweated, scraped and clawed past Tommy Haas in a protracted, 
                  difficult semi. The clear favourite in the final against Thomas 
                  Johansson, he stayed with the script for one set, then faded 
                  in four. Blithely unconcerned, Safin pronounced the day a success 
                  - &quot;You have to enjoy the moment&quot; - and hastily departed 
                  for 22nd birthday celebrations with his rock-star entourage. 
                  What's Russian for &quot;Who-gives-a-damn?&quot; &quot;I reached 
                  the final of a Grand Slam,&quot; Safin reflected, &quot;and 
                  sure, it's disappointing not to win, but what am I supposed 
                  to do? Lock myse;f in a room and cry?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  A second-round loser at Wimbledon, Safin was again anaesthetised 
                  to the pain of defeat. Seeded second behind Hewitt, he entered 
                  the All England Club with the best Grand Slam win tally this 
                  year (11-2) but was ousted in four by world No 50 Olivier Rochus. 
                  &quot;I couldn't find my game today,&quot; he lamely lobbed. 
                  &quot;Is bad day at the office.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Not only is Safin nonchalant in defeat; he doesn't care to learn 
                  from his losses either. &quot;It happens,&quot; Safin shrugged 
                  at Wimbledon. &quot;You cannot do anything but say 'Well done, 
                  good luck for the rest of the tournament.' You cannot start 
                  thinking, 'What I did wrong? What I did good?' It happens, that's 
                  it, it's over.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  What makes these displays so insulting is that the guy has the 
                  biggest game in tennis. At the 1998 French Open, Safin made 
                  arguably the most impressive Grand Slam debut in tennis history, 
                  upending Andre Agassi and defending champion Gustavo Kuerten 
                  in successive matches. Two summers ago in New York, he had Flushing 
                  Meadows reverberating with future shock after obliterating Pete 
                  Sampras in the US Open final. The fading champion was reminded 
                  of his own Grand Slam arrival on the same court exactly a decade 
                  before. &quot;He could be No 1 if he wants it,&quot; said the 
                  shell-shocked Sampras. &quot;He's a big, strong guy and he's 
                  got all the tools. Being No 1 and staying there is a different 
                  ball game but he's got the potential to do that.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Prophetic words. Withing a few weeks, having amassed a tour-best 
                  seven tournaments in 2000, Safin made history as the youngest 
                  man atop the computer rankings, though he didn't stay there. 
                  Still, it was a stunning reversal of his earl-season form, when 
                  he was fined for tanking in the first round at the Australian 
                  Open, endured the bleakest slump of his career and even considered 
                  quitting. <br>
                  <br>
                  The question at that breakthrough US Open was always whether 
                  Safin could maintain his dominant form. Few are surprised at 
                  his mixed progress since. Safin himself left a clue that his 
                  first Slam victory had taken him by surprise. Asked during the 
                  trophy presentation how he managed to manhandle the Sampras 
                  serve so well, the young behemoth replied: &quot;You think I 
                  know?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  In a wretched 2001 season that saw his ranking fall from two 
                  to 22, Safin was quick to point to the back, knee and rib troubles 
                  that marred his year. An ill-advised raquet change resulted 
                  in a lawsuit and an eventual return to his old Head stick. Others 
                  attribute the backslide to mental, as much as physical, fragility.<br>
                  &quot;It was frightening how well he played to win the US Open,&quot; 
                  observes John Newcombe. &quot;The following year, it's like 
                  he couldn't stand the pressure of everyone thinking he was that 
                  good - including himself.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin promised better things in 2002. &quot;I'm more prepared,&quot; 
                  he vowed at the start of the year. &quot;I'm ready to play and 
                  I'm ready to compete for No 1&quot; Yet, the world No 2 began 
                  the North American hardcourt season with zero tournament wins 
                  this year. What's up with that?<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Me, I'm not a complete nutcase,&quot; Safin said with 
                  a laugh, in a conference call late in July. &quot;I'm just different. 
                  Some people don't understand. Sometimes when I'm losing I have 
                  to push myself, I have to break raquet or hit the ball out of 
                  the court. It helps me.&quot; Is he stung by talk that he's 
                  squandering his talent? &quot;It hurts, of course it hurts.&quot; 
                  Is he going to curb the on-court antics? &quot;It's just the 
                  way I am. I'm going to change myself when I'm 22?&quot; he asks, 
                  rhetorically. <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin is content to ride his prodigious talent rather than work 
                  it. It all comes down to that elusive confidence. &quot;It's 
                  like love. When you look too hard, you don't find it&quot; It's 
                  also a cop-out for not working harder. Mats Wilander, the Swedish 
                  great who was Safin's coach for most of 2001, says: &quot;You 
                  always have to try to change your game and improve some things. 
                  He has a bit of an attitude that 'I'm good enough to win Grand 
                  Slams, so I'll keep on doing what I'm doing'. He isn't motivated 
                  to improve as other players are. If you want to change anything 
                  in your game, you have to do it between 19 and 22. That's where 
                  Safin is now. If he doesn't do it now, he'll always be the same 
                  player, a great player but unfortunately not another Sampras 
                  or Agassi.&quot;<br>
                  &quot;There's some weakness in his volleys and other parts of 
                  the court,&quot; adds Newcombe. &quot;He won't improve on those 
                  unless he does the extra hard yards. If you don't put in the 
                  hours, you'll be found out on the big occasions.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  On court, too, Safin isn't the hardest worker. &quot;I have 
                  to push myself to work hard and fight in a match,&quot; he admits. 
                  More than half of Safin's career losses have been straight-sets, 
                  crash-and-burn affairs. Runs of first-round losses are another 
                  career signature. Although the scorelines in 2002 have been 
                  more respectable (no first round exit in 17 events), players 
                  know that Safin's game can suddenly go from stupendous to stupid. 
                  <br>
                  Nowhere is Safin's undisciplined approach highlighted more than 
                  in his coaching arrangement, which has all the organisation 
                  of a train wreck. Why was Wilander, a triple Australian Open 
                  champion, skiing in Idaho last January while his charge fell 
                  at the last hurdle in Melbourne, watched by several guys wearing 
                  coach tags and, of course, the mandatory blondes? Mused Wilander: 
                  &quot;I didn't decide to stop coaching Marat. We were supposed 
                  to go to Australia. I think he didn't feel he needed to have 
                  me there, or wanted to have me there.&quot;<br>
                  Word was that Safin was paying huge money for Wilander's services 
                  - something like $US320,000 for 16 weeks work ($US20,000 per 
                  week). He may have decided the return didn't justify the investment. 
                  Why pay for even the best advice if you're not going to take 
                  it?<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin's fair-weather attitude sure doesn't give a coach a lot 
                  to work with. &quot;A player like Safin will go through a lot 
                  of coaches,&quot; Newcombe observes. &quot;It's hard to put 
                  your heart and soul into a guy like that.&quot; Indeed, Safin 
                  is a one-man job centre for coaches. He burned through three 
                  in 2000 alone. Lately Safin has travelled with semi-retired 
                  Swiss pro and neighbour Marc Rosset, a fellow genial-giant who 
                  knows how to enjoy himself off-court. <br>
                  <br>
                  At age 14, as soon as his tennis-playing parents found him a 
                  sponsor, Safin left his family in Moscow and, without speaking 
                  a word of Spanish, moved to Valencia to further his tennis. 
                  He says the transfer was the toughest thing he ever did. Isolated 
                  and immersed in tennis, the teenage years in Spain left several 
                  marks. Safin ressembles a wild child who bucks authority and 
                  defiantly does it all his own way. The reliance on a large supporter 
                  group - &quot;My family&quot; as Safin refers to his entourage 
                  - could well be a legacy of those years, when he lacked the 
                  support of his real family. Friends are now at the top of Safin's 
                  personal ranking system - &quot;They are everything,&quot; he 
                  says.<br>
                  <br>
                  The extensive Safin entourage is unusual in tennis. Observing 
                  the expanding cast of characters in Melbourne this year, Alex 
                  Metreveli, Safin's countryman and '73 Wimbledon finalist, said 
                  Safin is confused about who to have around him. &quot;They're 
                  friends for a week while he is doing well,&quot; he remarked. 
                  Newcombe sees it as proof that &quot;He's yet to develop the 
                  art of being uncompromising in an effort to maximise his potential. 
                  Whatever he achieves, he wants to have a good time on the way.&quot; 
                  No argument there from Safin. He won't be switching to a monastic 
                  lifestyle anytime soon. &quot;If you're satisfied in your life 
                  out of the court, you play much better inside the court,&quot; 
                  he reasons. <br>
                  <br>
                  Force-fed tennis throughout his teenage years, for Safin now, 
                  nothing is more horrifying than a life committed to the game. 
                  Nyet to that. &quot;It would be the biggest mistake in my life,&quot; 
                  he declares. &quot;No way. I love tennis but I like to enjoy 
                  my life. It would be a pity to spend probably the best years 
                  of my life just living with tennis. Definitely not. I don't 
                  think you have to destroy your life just because of tennis. 
                  Is boring. Is very boring. I am 22 years old. I am living right 
                  on Miami Beach. I am having so much fun. Why I have to change 
                  my way of life? I love it. Sorry.&quot; He's had all the pain; 
                  now for the gain.<br>
                  <br>
                  In a heavily stage-managed sport, Safin, with his movie-star 
                  looks, chattiness with the press and sly sense of humour, is 
                  a welcome charismatic presence. He can never be accused of taking 
                  himself, or the tennis caper, too seriously. He's popular with 
                  his peers. &quot;I get along with everyone,&quot; he proudly 
                  reports. &quot;We compete, then we leave the court and we are 
                  friends. Just because I play you, I have to hate you? No.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin would be even more popular if he developed a hatred for 
                  losing (a la Hewitt), played the part of the tennis giant instead 
                  of the tennis playboy and engaged Hewitt in a serious battle 
                  for the top spot. Hewitt-Safin has the makings of a ripping 
                  rivalry. The classic David and Goliath showdown. The pair could 
                  hardly be more different - in strengths, stature or approach. 
                  Safin the king-hitter versus Hewitt the counter-puncher. <br>
                  <br>
                  Thunderous serve versus lightning return. Mind versus muscle, 
                  concentration versus inspiration. The biggest player versus 
                  the best competitor. Currently locked at three-all, the rivalry's 
                  progression depends a lot more on Safin. He'll need to lift 
                  his professional commitment if he is to make regular finals 
                  appointments with the fantastically single-minded and dependable 
                  Hewitt. <br>
                  <br>
                  They've split two matches this year; the Australian taking a 
                  third-set tiebreak decision in Miami and Safin squaring up on 
                  German clay 6-3 6-1 - the most clear-cut scoreline in their 
                  six meetings. Hewitt needed four sets to win their first meeting, 
                  in the '99 Davis cup semi-final on grass in Brisbane. Newcombe 
                  was courtside as captain, and what sticks in his memory is Safin's 
                  poor approach to the match, on his weakest surface. &quot;He'd 
                  lost the plot,&quot; Newk recalls. &quot;He was pretty average; 
                  not enjoying himself and very down on himself. Here was this 
                  immense talent who wasn't making the most of it. You hate to 
                  see that.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Late in 2001, Hewitt one-upped the Russian, taking the US Open 
                  title and his place in history as the youngest man atop the 
                  rankings (at 20 years and eight months, bettering Safin by a 
                  mere month). Unlike Safin, however, Hewitt held on to the No 
                  1 position.<br>
                  <br>
                  Ths Us Open this month is the perfect stage for a rematch. &quot;There, 
                  we're going to see who's pretending to be No 1 and who has more 
                  chances [to stay there],&quot; vows Safin. &quot;I would like 
                  to finish this year No 1. It would be a big honour. I want it.&quot; 
                  While he respects Hewitt - &quot;He's tough to beat. He's really 
                  consistent, he doesn't lose his mind, doesn't make any mistakes, 
                  very good anticipation, very fast&quot; - Safin doesn't view 
                  the feisty Australian as a dominant No 1. &quot;There is not 
                  a 100 percent No 1 like Sampras was,&quot; according to Safin. 
                  &quot;Of course, we have Hewitt, he is a great player but playing 
                  against him, we know we have a chance. If we're fighting, we 
                  know we can beat him.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Who knows with him?&quot; responds Hewitt. &quot;He can 
                  blow anyone away on any given day. Like when he beat Sampras 
                  at the Australian Open - that was one of the most incredible 
                  matches I've seen. When he's on, he's the No 1, 2 or 3 player 
                  in the world. Marat is tough to play because I feel he's getting 
                  better and better at the areas he's had slight weaknesses in. 
                  He's more aggressive. He come to the net a lot more now. I think 
                  he's becoming a more all-court player. It's just really tough 
                  to find too many weaknesses in his game.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  That's because the weaknesses aren't in Safin's game; they're 
                  in his head. And until he decides to put it all on the line, 
                  he'll only be the ultimate singles player OFF the court. Will 
                  Safin one day regret his profligate ways? &quot;Who knows,&quot; 
                  says Newcombe, &quot;whether he'll stay an up-and-down guy, 
                  or whether he'll put his head down for four years to see what 
                  he can achieve. He himself probably doesn't know the answer.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Give it a go, Marat. More success in the Slams would mean even 
                  more love from the fans. And, even better, they'll respect you 
                  the next day.<br>
