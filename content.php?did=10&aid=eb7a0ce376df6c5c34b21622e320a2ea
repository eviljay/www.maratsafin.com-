<td class="article-body"><P><STRONG>Safin gives lengthy interview after beating Kim</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>September 27 2006<BR><BR><BR></STRONG>Marat Safin recovered from a slow start to beat Kevin Kim 2-6 6-1 6-4 to move into the second round. <BR><BR>The mercurial Russian who had come straight from his Davis Cup win in Moscow where he contributed to the victory over the US on clay, admitted that the change of surface had been difficult for him to adjust to: <BR><BR>"It was a little bit complicated with the change of surface; there very slow and here is pretty fast", Safin said. "Difficult conditions and had to adapt which cost me one set to get used to the court. Then I started to play much better; I was pretty satisfied with the way I'm playing. Started to play well and find some rhythm." <BR><BR>"I'm pretty happy with the way I'm moving and my knees are holding up. Hopefully it will stay this way all this week." <BR><BR>Safin and Blake are favoured to face off in a possible semi-final particularly in the absence of Marcos Baghdatis who withdrew and Juan Carlos Ferrero who lost yesterday to Mischa Zverev. However, the former world number 1 is very aware that he cannot afford to look beyond his next opponent: <BR><BR>"I'm facing a very difficult match. (Julien) Benneteau is a very good player; he made the quarterfinal of Roland Garros, it's not going to be an easy match. If I get through it's going to be even more difficult." <BR><BR>Safin seems to be playing better tennis of late, and so I asked him if he was enjoying the freedom of playing without a coach. <BR>"It has been a very difficult year. I had to take some time away from Peter. My head was spinning; I didn't know what to do. I was completely misguided; didn't feel like I was playing my game. I wanted to think about these things by myself; decide what is good and what is bad, so I can make the right choice without any mistakes. At my age you can't afford to make many mistakes because there are not many years left. You want to cruise through the last 4 or 5 years without any upset and stupid mistakes because already I've done a lot in the past, so just make sure everything goes well smoothly. Everything is going pretty well actually." <BR><BR>Safin still believes he can make it back into the top 10 and has made it his priority: <BR>"That's my goal; there is no other reason for me to play tennis", Safin insisted. "Money I have; only about what to achieve. My biggest priority is to come back to the top 10, then I think I will have a couple of chances to win a Grand Slam with a good draw and a little bit of luck; basically that is why I'm still playing." <BR><BR>Marat Safin has always been particularly adoring to his female fans, so did he feel that his short hair was more appealing to them? <BR><BR>"I don't know", a smiling and slightly embarrassed Safin insisted. "That is a question you have to put to the fans." <BR><BR>Does he prefer it shot or long? <BR><BR>"Like this it's easier", he said pulling at the short strands. <BR><BR>You used to have a ponytail? <BR><BR>"Yeah, I looked like a woman!" (Loud laughter) <BR>What other hairstyle after this Marat? <BR><BR>"Not much you can do with this!" he said tugging once again at his locks. <BR><BR>Andre Jones <BR>Impact Stadium <BR>Bangkok <BR><BR></P></td>
