                  Safin isn't first to face rough patch<br>
                  By Greg Garber<br>

                  <br>
                  NEW YORK -- A year ago, the very axis of men's tennis tilted 
                  on this single freeze-frame:<br>
                  <br>
                  Marat Safin, young, handsome and looking like he'd been there 
                  before, held the U.S. Open championship trophy aloft, while 
                  Pete Sampras, giving away three inches, 20 pounds, nine years 
                  and more than a few strands of hair, stood behind, clutching 
                  the runner's-up plate and looking longingly at Safin's sterling 
                  cup. "He's the future of the game," Sampras said later. "He's 
                  going to win many majors. It was weird. Usually at the ceremony, 
                  I get to hold up the big trophy." You want weird? A year later 
                  -- even with Safin mired in a disastrous, injury-riddled season 
                  that still lacks a tournament victory -- Sampras could still 
                  be right. Like Safin, Sampras won his first Grand Slam here 
                  at the National Tennis Center at a tender age (19). It's long 
                  forgotten now, but Sampras failed to win a single one of the 
                  next 10 majors played before adding 12 more Grand Slams to his 
                  record total. Is Safin, still a tender 21, feeling the pressure 
                  of being the defending champion?<br>
                  </font> <br>
                  <font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1">&quot;I 
                  don't really care,&quot; he said Monday night after dispatching 
                  qualifier Sebastien De Chaunac 6-4, 6-2, 6-2 in a rain-delayed, 
                  first-round У OK, if I don't defend, what's going to happen? 
                  Nothing. I have nothing to defend next year. It's perfect! Ф 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  English is merely the Russian's second language, but he has 
                  a wonderful feel for expressing sarcasm. While no one is predicting 
                  that Safin will repeat his break-through 2000 performance, there 
                  is evidence that he has survived the dreaded season-after with 
                  reasonable aplomb. Although the draw is impossibly loaded against 
                  him -- Sampras, top-seeded Andre Agassi and Patrick Rafter are 
                  all on his side of the draw -- Safin could do some damage.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I'm coming here again, I'm coming here to win it,&quot; 
                  Safin said. &quot;For me, [it] would not be enough if I make 
                  quarterfinals or semifinals. I still have a chance. I'm still 
                  in draw, and I'm playing OK. I will fight and I will give everything. 
                  I want to win, definitely.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Safin's Law</b><br>
                  In terms of sheer talent, Safin is among a mere handful of players, 
                  male or female, in the world. And yet, there have been times 
                  this year when Safin has genuinely wondered what will go wrong 
                  next. And sure enough, something always does. How frustrating 
                  has it been for the player who won 73 of 100 matches and an 
                  ATP-high seven titles last year to wind up with the No. 2 ranking?<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin laughed. &quot;There's so many that you cannot -- it will 
                  not -- we don't have enough time.&quot; <br>
                  Here's a quick stab:<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin, who admittedly came into the year exhausted from his 
                  impressive second half run, exited in the Round of 16 at the 
                  Australian Open in straight sets courtesy of Dominik Hrbaty. 
                  He was bounced in the first round at Rotterdam by Max Mirnyi 
                  -- the first of seven first-round ousters in 17 events -- and 
                  then injured his back in Dubai in February despite reaching 
                  the final there.<br>
                  <br>
                  It is ironic that Safin, the only player in modern history to 
                  receive a fine ($2,000 at last year's Australian Open) for tanking 
                  a match, would seemingly soldier on so heroically. He lost three 
                  consecutive first-round matches in Indian Wells, Miami and Monte 
                  Carlo, then lost in the second round in Rome and Hamburg. It 
                  turned out that Safin had motivation, a financial motivation. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin was playing through the ATP's Masters Series events for 
                  a $1.4 million bonus that is linked to participation in all 
                  nine events. The price for missing just one of these tournaments 
                  is $350,000. Missing two costs $700,000. Miss three and there 
                  is no bonus at all.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;People can criticize me and say I just play for the money,&quot; 
                  Safin said in May, &quot;but if they knew what that meant and 
                  were in my situation, they would do the same thing.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>From a different mold</b><br>
                  Safin is not a Stanford-educated athlete who grew up playing 
                  at a posh country club. He was born in Moscow and was shipped 
                  to Valencia, Spain, at the age of 14 to master the game of tennis. 
                  He turned professional in 1997, but his first three years on 
                  the Tour netted him less than $1 million, which puts his insistence 
                  on playing for that bonus in a different context.<br>
                  <br>
                  Earlier this year, People Magazine named Safin one of the 25 
                  most intriguing people in the world and his potential alone 
                  makes him difficult to dismiss. He is still relatively quite 
                  young; he has broken, by his count, more than 150 rackets to 
                  date.<br>
                  <br>
                  In the spring, a steadying influence arrived unexpectedly in 
                  his life. Safin has been coached over the years by Spaniard 
                  Rafael Mensua and has received guidance from Russians Andrei 
                  Chesnokov and Alexander Volkov. Now six-time Grand Slam winner 
                  Mats Wilander is attempting to temper the man with the volatile 
                  temper.<br>
                  <br>
                  Wilander, who was raising four children in the suburbs of Connecticut 
                  and whittling his golf handicap into the single digits, saw 
                  Safin play last year and told a number of disbelieving people 
                  that he had the capacity to win the U.S. Open. They were introduced 
                  by a mutual friend and have been carving out a relationship 
                  that could carry Safin to the top of the game.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;The results are not coming straight away,&quot; Safin 
                  acknowledged. &quot;You have to wait. First we have to work 
                  for three or four months, then it's coming. Slowly, [results] 
                  start to come. You can't rush.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;If he stays with me for a long time, I think I can win 
                  a few more Grand Slams.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Few, including perhaps Safin himself, believe that it will be 
                  this one. His confidence, thanks to Wilander, is just starting 
                  to come around.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin reached the quarterfinals at Wimbledon, losing to eventual 
                  champion Goran Ivanisevic. After losing his first-round match 
                  in Cincinnati earlier this month, Safin came back the next week 
                  and belted his way to the semifinals, where he lost a stout 
                  three-set match in a tiebreaker to Patrick Rafter.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I'm trying to make some good results,&quot; Safin said. 
                  &quot;And it would be great if I could make -- I mean, it's 
                  going to be a miracle if I can win here because the way I played 
                  all year, it's a joke.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;But I'm there. I'm trying. I'm still fighting and I think 
                  I can,&quot; he said. &quot;Everything is possible, huh?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
