                  Publication date: 2001-05-30<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  So Marat Safin. You are undeniably one of the three most talented 
                  tennis players in the world. You have a two-handed backhand 
                  that even your new coach, Mats Wilander, would have traded up 
                  for. You can hit a first serve that leaves opponents shaking 
                  their heads and confirming their airline reservations. For a 
                  big man with a power game you even relish playing on clay. <br>
                  <br>
                  So why are the pundits busy talking about Gustavo Kuerten and 
                  Juan Carlos Ferrero instead of you when it comes to prospective 
                  champions at the French Open this year? <br>
                  <br>
                  Because you arrived at Roland Garros with a journeyman's record 
                  of 15-14 for the year. Because you played through back pain 
                  for the money for most of the early spring. And because your 
                  body language has been fluently negative of late. <br>
                  <br>
                  But we all know your capabilities. We saw them at the U.S. Open 
                  last year, when you made the all-time great Pete Sampras look 
                  like an interested bystander on your way to your first Grand 
                  Slam title at age 20. And now, even though you have been down 
                  and out of sorts since January, we, you and your opponents know 
                  it is only a matter of time before that serve and that backhand 
                  and that rangy athleticism start to put big trophies back in 
                  your deft hands. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;There's only a little bit that separates the best guys,&quot; 
                  said Andre Agassi, who won easily on Tuesday and leads the points 
                  race this year, 29 spots ahead of the foundering Safin. &quot;If 
                  you give up any edge that you have, I think you find yourself 
                  struggling a lot more than you could ever anticipate. I certainly 
                  have been through it in my own right, but he's been too good 
                  not to come around. The question is always when.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  There were definite signs of life in the first round Tuesday, 
                  when Safin hustled convincingly past Austria's dangerous floater 
                  Markus Hipfl by the score of 6-3, 6-3, 6-7 (6-8), 6-1. There 
                  was still a shade too much looseness in Safin's tennis on this 
                  sunny afternoon: an untidy ground- <br>
                  <br>
                  stroke here, a careless service return there. But what he did 
                  do was lift his game when he needed to most, which is essentially 
                  what separates the great from the good on the Darwinian men's 
                  circuit. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;He's been struggling physically the last two or three 
                  months, but he's better now,&quot; said Wilander, the former 
                  French Open champion who began coaching Safin this year. &quot;He 
                  takes risks. That's the way he plays. It's kind of scary to 
                  watch it. It doesn't look safe, but he's able to do it.&quot; 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  When asked whether he thought he could still win this tournament 
                  despite the dominant play of Kuerten and Ferrero on clay this 
                  year, Safin answered: &quot;I don't care what results they have. 
                  I mean it doesn't bother me at all. I'm coming here. I'm playing 
                  my game. I don't see who's winning, who's playing, who's losing. 
                  I'm just trying to get my confidence back, play some matches.&quot; 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  His plan is still to play seven, however. &quot;I'm not coming 
                  here to make the last 16 or the quarterfinals,&quot; he said. 
                  &quot;For me, it's nothing. I want to win here.&quot; Safin 
                  next faces Alex Calatrava of Spain. <br>
                  <br>
                  Sampras might be the all-time leader in Grand Slam singles titles 
                  with 13, but he has never reached the final in Paris and has 
                  not advanced past the third round since 1996. On Tuesday, he 
                  gave yet another anonymous opponent plenty of hope but ultimately 
                  escaped with a 6-3, 4-6, 6-2, 3-6, 8-6 victory after saving 
                  three match points in the final set. <br>
                  <br>
                  Sampras's 25-year-old opponent, the French qualifier Cedric 
                  Kauffmann, had played only two tour-level matches in his career. 
                  In January, he was beaten in a challenger in Hawaii by 44-year-old 
                  Gene Mayer, a former American star who had not played a tour 
                  event in 15 years. &quot;That makes me feel real good,&quot; 
                  Sampras said.<br>
                  <br>
                  Sampras will have to lift his level considerably and shake free 
                  of the baseline much more often if he is to get past a much 
                  more experienced clay-courter, Galo Blanco of Spain, in the 
                  next round.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin's biggest obstacle has been physical, but he says he now 
                  has only occasional pain in his lower back and can now serve 
                  normally. The pain began in February in Dubai, one month after 
                  he was beaten in the fourth round of the first Grand Slam event 
                  of the year, the Australian Open, by Dominik Hrbaty. The surprise 
                  was that he kept on playing and struggling through the first 
                  five Masters Series events.<br>
                  <br>
                  Though such perseverance seemed foolhardy, Safin had his reason: 
                  a $1.4 million bonus from the ATP that is linked to participation 
                  in all nine Masters Series events. Miss one for any reason and 
                  you lose $350,000. Miss another and you lose $700,000. Miss 
                  three and you lose it all<br>
                  <br>
                  So Safin played on. &quot;People can criticize me and say I 
                  play just for the money, but if they knew what that meant and 
                  were in my situation, they would do the same thing,&quot; he 
                  said last week in Dusseldorf.<br>
                  <br>
                  It is indeed a short-term view, but Safin has made it clear 
                  that he has not yet assured his financial security. And for 
                  a young man who grew up in a country in transition (Russia) 
                  and left home at age 14 to train in Valencia with a Spanish 
                  coach, financial security is no trifling matter. He has parents 
                  and a younger sister, Dinara, to help, and she is also a potentially 
                  world-class player. <br>
                  <br>
                  But for now, the best thing he can do is help himself: by plunging 
                  into his tennis; by getting more therapy on his back and by 
                  lending an ear to his coach, who knows a great deal more than 
                  most men about how to win under pressure in Paris. 
                  <p>&quot;The thing about Marat,&quot; Wilander said, &quot;is 
                    that he can raise his game as high as he wants to.&quot; <br>
