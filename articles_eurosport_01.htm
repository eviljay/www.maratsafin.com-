                  <br>
                  Russian Marat Safin heads into the U.S. hard court season unsure 
                  if he can come close to repeating his achievements of 12 months 
                  ago.<br>
<br>
Last year on the American hardcourts the 21-year-old ran 
                    up an impressive 12-2 win-loss record ,capped by the finest 
                    title triumph of his career - at the U.S. Open. In the U.S. 
                    Open final he beat Pete Sampras, holder of a record 13 Grand 
                    Slam trophies, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3.<br>
<br>
&quot;That moment was the best moment of my life, right after 
                    match point,&quot; said Safin, who ended the 2000 season as 
                    the number two player in the world behind Brazilian Gustavo 
                    Kuerten, during a teleconference on Thursday.<br>
<br>
&quot;It was the best moment, it felt so good, but I can't 
                    describe it. It was just perfect. You realise you won one 
                    of the biggest tournaments in the world only two seconds ago 
                    - it is the perfect feeling.&quot;<br>
<br>
This year, however, he has yet to feel anything close to 
                    that.<br>
<br>
Playing Juan Carlos Ferrero in the Dubai final in February, 
                    Safin trailed the Spaniard 6-2, 3-1 when he retired with a 
                    back injury. That injury kept him out of action for nearly 
                    two months and derailed his confidence. From a purely physical 
                    perspective, it now seems that Safin is back on track, having 
                    reached the Wimbledon quarter-finals before falling to eventual 
                    champion Goran Ivanisevic.<br>
<br>
But the Russian is still sounding unsure of himself. &quot;I'm 
                    much better than before when I was injured at the beginning 
                    of the year, right before the Indian Wells tournament,&quot; 
                    Safin said. &quot;I didn't play for like one and a half months. 
                    I couldn't play. It was hard because I never knew when I could 
                    come back and start to play and start to play well. And I 
                    came back with no confidence.&quot;<br>
<br>
Safin has a heavy U.S. summer schedule starting in Los Angeles 
                    next week and taking in Montreal, Cincinnati and Indianapolis 
                    before attempting to successfully defend his U.S. Open title. 
                    In one breath, Safin seems willing to write off the year and 
                    look ahead to 2002, but in the next he is hoping to recoup 
                    his losses and have a strong second half of the season.<br>
<br>
&quot;I'm completely recovered, but I don't know if I have 
                    enough confidence to play big matches,&quot; Safin said. &quot;I 
                    think it's a little too late for this year but I hope to be 
                    better for next year.<br>
<br>
&quot;But it really depends on how I do in the States this 
                    summer. If I could win a few tournaments in America this summer, 
                    I could look to make the Masters [year-end Tennis Masters 
                    Cup] and that would be perfect for me.&quot;<br>
<br>
The man in charge of boosting Safin's morale as well as putting 
                    his game into championship form is former world number one 
                    Mats Wilander. The Swede, a seven-time Grand Slam champion, 
                    became Safin's coach earlier this year. Safin seems certain 
                    that Wilander is the right man for him.<br>
<br>
                  &quot;Mats, I'm really happy to work with him,&quot; Safin said. 
                  &quot;I'm learning a lot from him and I'm happy to be with him 
                  because it is a great experience. He's coming to Montreal and 
                  we'll start work there to get ready for the Open.&quot;
<br>
<br>
Always one to crack a joke, Safin deflected questions about 
                    his forthcoming U.S. Open defence by insisting that he has 
                    only one wish at Flushing Meadow.<br>
<br>
&quot;I think that the people in charge of transportation 
                    will recognise me this year and that would be great for me,&quot; 
                    said Safin, who went unrecognised by some of the transportation 
                    crew last year, even after reaching the final.<br><br>
