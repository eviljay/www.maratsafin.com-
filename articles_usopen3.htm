                  <br>
                  Young Russian Marat Safin had a more difficult time getting 
                  a ride to the U.S. Open on Saturday than he did with tennis 
                  pop hero Todd Martin, out-muscling his graying elder 6-3, 7-6 
                  (4), 7-6 (1) to become the first Russian to reach the U.S. Open 
                  final. <br>
                  <br>
                  The good-natured 20-year-old with Uzi groundstrokes had few 
                  problems with Martin's non-stop net approaches, using his rapid 
                  fire two-handed backhand and rolling forehand to frequently 
                  pass the Michigan giant.<br>
                  <br>
                  Martin, who became a fan favorite after his amazing late-night 
                  five-set win over Carlos Moya earlier this week, was simply 
                  not strong enough to keep up with Safin from the ground and 
                  didn't have enough stick on his approach shots.<br>
                  <br>
                  For his part, Safin was brilliant when it counted, winning the 
                  second set with a gorgeous backhand pass and a service winner, 
                  and taking the match by playing a nearly perfect third set breaker, 
                  hitting two topspin lob winners and cracking a 133-mph ace on 
                  match point. <br>
                  <br>
                  Before he whacked Martin, the extroverted Safin told of his 
                  frustration with the transportation desk, who didn't recognize 
                  the name of the world's sixth-ranked player.<br>
                  <br>
                  "If the crowd is like this with me tomorrow, I have no chance 
                  to be somebody in the world," Safin laughed. "Maybe I'll wear 
                  a sign on my head that says, 'I'm Marat Safin.'"<br>
                  <br>
                  As efficient as a match he played, when Safin came off court, 
                  he couldn't stop criticizing himself.<br>
                  <br>
                  "I thought I was playing horrible," Safin said. "When I started, 
                  I was completely out of court. I couldn't find my concentration. 
                  I played without any pressure. I just had to concentrate. In 
                  the important moments, in the tiebreakers, I was 100 percent 
                  concentrated and that helped me."<br>
                  <br>
                  After Safin saw that he crushed 58 winners, including 13 aces, 
                  he reconsidered his analysis.<br>
                  <br>
                  "Actually I wasn't so bad. I made some great points. I was like 
                  a machine," he said. "To beat Todd Martin in two tiebreakers 
                  in the semis, you have to be a good player.I fight and that's 
                  it. <br>
                  <br>
                  "Even when I thought I was playing bad I was there from beginning 
                  to end. I was trying to run everywhere, to make something new. 
                  I became a fighter.<br>
                  <br>
                  " The 30-year-old Martin, who reached the final here last year, 
                  knew he was taken down by a better player.<br>
                  <br>
                  "He played the big points and the little points better than 
                  me," Martin said. "I was fighting an uphill battle all the way. 
                  I came in every point I could and it was purely out of defense. 
                  I had to attack in order not to get smothered."<br>
                  <br>
                  The fact is, the 6-foot-4, 180-pound Russian has bigger all-around 
                  weapons than most of his foes.<br>
                  <br>
                  "The game's pretty simple for him," Martin said. "Today he was 
                  able to hit winners with shots that weren't going for winners. 
                  If he understood that that is pretty good every day of the week, 
                  he would have no problem with a lot of guys. But, what with 
                  Lleyton and Pete do, they will concern him and he'll have a 
                  greater propensity to over hit. He saw molasses across the street 
                  and wasn't too worried about it." <br>
                  <br>
                  Martin is so high on young Safin's game that he thinks he will 
                  soon surpass his countryman, two-time Slam champ and former 
                  No. 1 Yevgeny Kafelnikov.<br>
                  <br>
                  "Marat is so well equipped physically and technically that he 
                  just has to go out and try physically to get through some matches, 
                  where I think a lot of times Yevgeny has to try mentally and 
                  physically," said Martin. "Marat's got a better nerve and eventually 
                  will be better than Yevgeny."<br>
                  <br>
                  During the first part of 2000, Safin spent much of his time 
                  destroying rackets and kicking balls into the stands. Now, he 
                  is displaying the steely nerves of chessmaster Gary Kasparov.<br>
                  <br>
                  "It's impressive to me that somebody can ignore what the environment 
                  is, what the situation is," Martin said. "Other guys like Pete 
                  can tell when push is coming to shove. With Marat, he plays 
                  the first point of the match as loose as the last point of the 
                  match. He's able to ignore the weight of the point, or he just 
                  executes under pressure better than most guys."<br>
                  <br>
                  While he is still not of legal drinking age in New York, the 
                  20-year-old Safin said that he went from tennis toddler to high 
                  school graduate in a matter of months. <br>
                  <br>
                  "I grew up," he said. "I started to understand that in order 
                  to become a good player, I have to be more professional, practice 
                  more, pay more attention in practice and to fight in matches, 
                  because I never fought. If I was playing good, I was playing 
                  unbelievable. When I was playing bad, I couldn't beat my mother. 
                  I started to practice with me head, not my strokes and everything 
                  came." <br>
                  <br>
                  Although Safin is the first person from his country to reach 
                  the final in Flushing, he's still not satisfied.<br>
                  <br>
                  "I still want to win the final. I want to feel this situation. 
                  Maybe I'm going to shout or get undressed on court," said Safin. 
                  "I don't know what I'm going to do if I win. It would be a great 
                  feeling to be champion at the U.S. Open." <br>
