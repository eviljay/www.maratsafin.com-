<P><STRONG>The Championships Wimbledon 2007<BR><BR>3rd Round</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>M. Safin - 29 June <BR></STRONG><I>Friday, 29 June, 2007</I><BR><BR></P>
<P>Roger Federer (SUI)[1] beat Marat Safin (RUS)[26] 6-1, 6-4, 7-6</P>
<P><B>Q. You talked yesterday about playing this match with nothing to lose, and yet it looked like until the third set, and when you really let the ball fly, you just played freely. It didn't look like you were playing with nothing to lose until then. </B></P>
<P>MARAT SAFIN: No, well, the problem was that I never played it's my first time I've played on Centre Court since many years, so I kind of it was a strange feeling for me, so it took me about two sets to get used to it. </P>
<P>The ball is a little bit sliding a little bit more than other courts, and of course the distance between the court is much bigger. So this was my problem. I couldn't get used to it, and the wind was into the wind of course I'm not taking any credit away from Roger, but still, it was a difficult sensation to get used to because it was a lot of wind, and the circumstances was tough for me to be in my game.</P>
<P><B>Q. On that crazy point at the end of the second set where the ball seemed to die in front of you as you tried to hit an inside out forehand, what happened there?</B></P>
<P>MARAT SAFIN: Well, tough conditions. It was a lucky shot, and but he made it. It also counts.</P>
<P><B>Q. Did you misjudge where it was going to bounce?</B></P>
<P>MARAT SAFIN: Well, it's kind of it was going away, then it was staying, so it was kind of difficult because it was supposed to fly out, and then it just bounced it didn't really bounce at all. So it's tough for me. </P>
<P><B>Q. In the tiebreak, you played a great tiebreak, almost no balls were coming back, and then that very casual volley at a key point. Did you play that one just too casually?</B></P>
<P>MARAT SAFIN: No, it just was a lot of spin and then just I misjudged the power that was going, actually. I thought it was going a little bit faster than was actually going, the ball, so just all of a sudden it catch me by surprise. </P>
<P><B>Q. If you had played the first set the way you played the third one </B></P>
<P>MARAT SAFIN: It would have been a different story.</P>
<P><B>Q. could it have been a different set, match?</B></P>
<P>MARAT SAFIN: Big time, because he was a little bit uptight, also, at the beginning of the first set. And then when he broke me he started to have more confidence and it was easy for him. But the first set if it were 7 6, it would be closer or a different match for sure.</P>
<P><B>Q. Do you think anyone can beat him this year?</B></P>
<P>MARAT SAFIN: I don't see anybody who can hurt him because everybody knows how to play against him but they don't have enough weapons to beat him, unfortunately.</P>
<P><B>Q. Could you tell that he was uptight with you at the beginning?</B></P>
<P>MARAT SAFIN: I could feel at first, the first game he didn't serve that well, missed a couple of easy shots, so he was also a little bit nervous because he didn't know with what I'm going to come up. Then when he broke me. It was a completely different game. </P>
<P><B>Q. How inspired were you to play against Roger? I mean, you've had some fantastic matches in the past. Is it more fun to play a match like that today?</B></P>
<P>MARAT SAFIN: Well, it's a little bit well, for me it's anyway great because just to see it's another opportunity for me to see that actually I can still play at some great level, and for me it's a challenge and for me it's another push to bring back my game. </P>
<P>Even lose or win this match, it's just a different approach, and I can see that I still have a lot of tennis, and I need to I know what I have to do a little bit to improve my game. So kind of it was a help actually. Even though this court was pretty easy, it's a huge help for me.</P>
<P><B>Q. Where are you in terms of your relationship with grass?</B></P>
<P>MARAT SAFIN: Well, I think it's okay. My game is pretty suitable for the grass, but you need to have enough confidence and enough matches to play against players like him. Not the first and second round where he's good and you're not really used to the grass and then maybe closer to quarterfinals, semifinals, it's a different game.</P>
<P><B>Q. Let me move to your best surface, hard court. How many US Open Series tournaments do you plan on playing?</B></P>
<P>MARAT SAFIN: All of them. Well, which ones? </P>
<P><B>Q. There are six tournaments in the </B><B>US</B><B> Open Series leading up to the </B><B>US</B><B> Open. </B></P>
<P>MARAT SAFIN: Well, this year is tough. I don't even know how it works, the points, and then it's like if you make something, you win, you have double prize money, so it's really I cannot get it. It's the second, third year that I'm making it and it's still too complicated to understand.</P>
<P><B>Q. You'll still be in </B><B>Cincinnati</B><B>, </B><B>Canada</B><B>. Anywhere else?</B></P>
<P>MARAT SAFIN: LA.</P>
<P><B>Q. Do you wish that you'd come to this understanding of grass earlier in your career?</B></P>
<P>MARAT SAFIN: Well, I can't complain about my career anyhow, because let's put it this way: If you would have seen me in 1995, 1996, you would really understand what actually what became from me, because it's really for you guys who started to meet me in 1998 where I started to make my first money and I started to win some matches. </P>
<P>If you would have seen me in 1996, then you would have really surprised even that I'm still playing that I'm playing tennis. </P>
<P><B>Q. But in 1992 here, Hewitt won. </B></P>
<P>MARAT SAFIN: In 2002.</P>
<P><B>Q. Yeah, sorry. That would have been a year maybe you would have had a good chance if you were happier on grass?</B></P>
<P>MARAT SAFIN: Well, I had a chance 2001 when Ivanisevic won. He won three sets pretty tough: 7 6, 7 5, 3 6 7 6, and I think it was my best year, quarterfinals, my best year. I was playing pretty well, and I think I would have Henman in the semifinals, which is a good draw.</P>
<P><B>Q. Will you ever be a top ten player again?</B></P>
<P>MARAT SAFIN: Well, why not? I still have a few years left. Why not? If I'm not, then I'm not. I'm still playing because I still believe that I can get there, anyhow, and it doesn't matter when. </P>
<P><B>Q. You still don't like </B><B>Wimbledon</B><B>; maybe you said it's very expensive in </B><B>London</B><B>.</B></P>
<P>MARAT SAFIN: Well, the most expensive city is Moscow, first of all. It's not like I </P>
<P>dislike because everybody tries to pick on me and tries to put the words in my mouth because I said something that I don't like London. I love London, first of all. Wimbledon is a pretty good facility. It's okay. </P>
<P>So then I have my few things about the food, but it doesn't really matter. I don't make a big deal out of it, what I'm saying. But of course the press wants to start the sensation, Safin said and complained, and who cares about this. </P>
<P>But for sure there are people that like it. That's why I'm in this situation and that's why you're asking me this question.</P></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></P>

<TD>Hamburg, 14 May 2007<BR><BR>Press Conference with MARAT SAFIN<BR><BR>Safin - Massu 7:6 (7), 6:4<BR><BR>Q: Well done. Good to get that win, but it was an up and down match. First the long lead… What was the reason for these changes?<BR><BR>SAFIN: I started pretty well. I guess he was a little cold. He was pretty nervous, so he could not play his game. He took advantage at 4:0. He just had nothing to lose. I made a couple of mistakes. I did nothing wrong but he just went for it. And it went his way. He just came up to 5:4. The second break was tough for me because I was getting a bit nervous. I did not want to lose this opportunity. I wanted to close the set. Basically in all the games I had deuce or advantage. It was very close and I could not make it. In the tiebreak I was very disappointed because I had my chances an was playing the right game. Finally it went my way. Unfortunately sometimes the luck is not on my side. Sometimes I miss by a little bit. <BR><BR>Q: It is nice to win a match that had so many challenges in it for you, isn't it?<BR><BR>SAFIN: Very nice. Also for the confidence. I am not really in a great position right now. These kind of matches give me a lot of opportunity and confidence. Eventually my game has to come back because I am playing well, moving around really well, my fitness is great, doing the right things. Sometimes I just make some mistakes and everything goes the other way round. Especially now against Ferrero. I just have to take it match by match and make sure I take it point by point. Work, work, work and wait for opportunities.<BR><BR>Q: You brought your ranking right back from somewhere outside the Top 100 to somewhere in the 20ies. Does that mean your confidence is going up with it?<BR><BR>SAFIN: I finished the year 24. From middle of August until end of the season, I lost a lot of matches 7:6 in the third, 7:6 in the fifth against Haas in the US Open, Nalbandian, Madrid, then 7:6 in the semifinal to Blake in Bankog. Then 7:6, 7:6 to Clement in semi finals in Washington. If I would win 2 of these matches I would be Top 20. This year I was also very close to beating Davydenko. I had four match points against Vliegen in Monte Carlo. I was close to beat Roddick in Australia. So it's just something that did not go my way. I am also disappointed because I am stuck between 30 and 20 and don't move up. I need to defend the points in the second part of the season. So luck better starts to be on my side. Hopefully it will come my way.<BR><BR>Q: The tennis is there so is it a mental breakthrough you have to make?<BR><BR>SAFIN: It's just one, two points. I never lost one easy match. I'm running around, I want to play, I'm fighting. Just the last chance slips away.<BR><BR>Q: Is the knee 100%?<BR><BR>SAFIN: Yes, I'm moving around okay. I'm not getting tired. I'm perfect. I work a lot on the physical condition which is very important for me. Now it's a different part that is missing. <BR><BR>Q: The conditions can be slow and heavy here, but you've done well here before. Do you mind the conditions here?<BR><BR>SAFIN: Sometimes it's a bit slow. It depends on the weather. The balls can get heavy. But for the past few years, the balls have changed. Dunlop is a bit heavier than Head. It's okay. It's a little slower than Rome, but it's definitely not too slow. Today I had some bad bounces and mishits. I was a bit tough for me today.<BR><BR>Q: The ATP have been planning a lot of changes to the Tour. Do you have an opinion on that?<BR><BR>SAFIN: I think the people, who are in the positions to make the choices, I hope they know what they are doing. I don't want to get involved. We have to let it be and let the people at the top make their choices. We can play tennis but we can't change and make everybody happy. I'm sure that whoever is taking care of it knows what he is doing. Once we have him, let's give him a chance for 4, 5 years to see how it goes. It can't be worse than it used to be. When Mark Miles left, we had no chances. It was going bankrupt, no money. At least we have a lot of sponsors. It is getting better. It's picking up, but we have to believe in our people and make sure to support them, even though they make mistakes. Unfortunately, you want progress without any mistakes. People or tennis players should understand this, not to criticize if somebody makes a small mistake. They should not be shouting. We just have to let it be.<BR></TD></TR>
