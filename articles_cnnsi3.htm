                  By L. Jon Wertheim<br>
                  <br>
                  It wasn't merely a championship, it was a coronation. Or so 
                  it seemed when Marat Safin whipped Pete Sampras in straight 
                  sets in last year's U.S. Open final. Safin, then 20, blended 
                  a spring-loaded serve with a bludgeoning baseline game and was 
                  anointed the cynosure for the next generation in men's tennis. 
                  That he was handsome, outspoken and multilingual was a bonus. 
                  Even Sampras, generally sparing with his praise of other players, 
                  pegged Safin as the game's next big star. &quot;Right then,&quot; 
                  Safin says, &quot;I was the king.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  His reign didn't last long. Without a tournament title in 2001, 
                  Safin entered the RCA Championships in Indianapolis last week 
                  on a three-match losing streak. He was a woeful 29th in the 
                  ATP's Champions Race and had a 21-20 record pocked by losses 
                  to players like Peter Wessels and Juan Balcells. &quot;It's 
                  been disgusting,&quot; Safin said after narrowly beating journeyman 
                  Andre Sa on Aug. 14. &quot;Right now, I'm impressing myself 
                  with how badly I'm playing.&quot; 
                 <br>
<br>
Injuries were partially to blame for Safin's NASDAQian slide. 
                    A strained back he suffered in last March's Dubai tournament 
                    limited his mobility and, for months, made serving painful. 
                    Safin says that he should have rested, but, wary of forfeiting 
                    a portion of a $1.4 million ATP bonus for playing in all nine 
                    Masters Series events (he loses a third of the bonus for each 
                    of those tournaments he misses), he played when he was, by 
                    his estimate, only &quot;30 percent.&quot; He was also bothered 
                    by an aching left knee that caused him to retire late in a 
                    recent match in Montreal. <br>
                    <br>
                    As the losses accumulated, his already shaky psyche became 
                    fragile enough that it should have been swathed in bubble 
                    wrap. &quot;Every time you lose a match, the doubts come,&quot; 
                    he says. This phenomenon manifested itself in inexplicable 
                    play. On one point he'd be unnecessarily defensive; on the 
                    next he'd be too aggressive and overhit. &quot;You can tell 
                    he's not 100 percent sure of himself,&quot; said Xavier Malisse, 
                    who beat Safin last month in Los Angeles. <br>
                    <br>
                    Safin also needed months to grow comfortable with a new Dunlop 
                    racket, the product of a lucrative endorsement deal he signed 
                    in April. And he has been adjusting to a new coach, Mats Wilander. 
                    &quot;When Marat plays well, he can beat anyone,&quot; says 
                    Wilander, winner of seven Grand Slam events. <br>
                    <br>
                    Safin can take solace in precedent. Last year he lost 12 of 
                    his first 17 matches, one so egregiously that he was fined 
                    $2,000 for tanking, and pondered quitting. Without notice 
                    -- &quot;It was like magic,&quot; he says, shrugging -- his 
                    skills and confidence returned. He ended up winning a Tour-high 
                    seven titles, earned more than $3.5 million and came within 
                    a match of finishing 2000 as the points race champion. &quot;Tennis 
                    is a sport of momentum,&quot; he says. &quot;For me it's especially 
                    that way.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    His fortunes may have begun to change again last week. After 
                    surviving Sa, he played some of his most inspired tennis this 
                    year. Whipping lasers from the baseline and belting serves 
                    approaching 130 mph, he reached his first semifinal since 
                    March and had a match point before losing 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 (7) 
                    to Pat Rafter in an exceptionally high-quality match. &quot;When 
                    the week started, I had no confidence,&quot; says Safin. &quot;I'm 
                    not saying I'm going to win the U.S. Open now, but I feel 
                    like it's coming back.&quot;<br>
