                  <br>
                  <br>
                  PARIS -- Russian Marat Safin overcame a gashed right eyebrow 
                  and some fierce resistance from 13th-seeded Australian Mark 
                  Philippoussis to win Sunday's $2.95 million Paris Masters series 
                  final 3-6, 7-6 (9-7), 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (10-8). <br>
                  <br>
                  It was the number two seed's second title in eight days. He 
                  also won the St Petersburg title last weekend. <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin, 20, cut himself above the right eye when he hit himself 
                  with his own racket attempting a diving volley midway through 
                  the third set. He resumed after being treated by a doctor at 
                  courtside -- and promptly broke Philippoussis' serve to take 
                  the set. <br>
                  <br>
                  He needed ice on the injury during changes of end to keep down 
                  the swelling but finally won in three hours, 28 minutes on his 
                  sixth match point despite being battered and bloodied. <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin served 22 aces and Philippoussis 21.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Russian edged ahead 6-3 in the decisive tiebreaker but he 
                  wasted five match points before a Philippoussis forehand error 
                  finally gave him the win.<br>
                  <br>
                  "I was very lucky in the tiebreaker," Safin said. "Maybe one 
                  or two points made the difference."<br>
                  <br>
                  The victory boosted Safin's ambitions of finishing the year 
                  as the world's top-ranked player, increasing his lead over Brazilian 
                  Gustavo Kuerten in the ATP Champions Race to 73 points. <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin, the U.S. Open champion, won his seventh title of the 
                  year and became the only man this year to win two Masters Series 
                  events.<br>
                  <br>
                  He was also victorious in Toronto. Safin won $434,000, and Philippoussis 
                  earned $228,000. <br>
                  <br>
                  The Russian was beaten by Andre Agassi in last year's final 
                  of this event and won it in only his second appearance at the 
                  Bercy Sports Arena.<br>
                  <br>
                  "Marat's played well all year and this is why he is number one 
                  in the world at the moment," Philippoussis said.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Australian played sublime tennis in winning the first set 
                  in just 32 minutes. He had eight aces and his deep, grooved 
                  forehands immediately unsettled Safin, who hadn't dropped a 
                  set in reaching the final.<br>
                  <br>
                  Philippoussis' ground strokes were so accurate and hard-hit, 
                  and his touch at the net so deft, that Safin was regularly forced 
                  onto the backfoot. One break of serve, in the second game, was 
                  enough to give Philippoussis the opener. <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin was warned for hitting a ball into the crowd in the ninth 
                  game of the second set, which went on serve until the tiebreaker, 
                  which the Russian finally won 9-7 on his fourth set point. <br>
                  <br>
                  It was the first tiebreaker Philippoussis had lost of the six 
                  he had played in the tournament. At 3-3 in the third, Safin 
                  cut himself after his racket head flew up and hit him. <br>
                  <br>
                  The Russian fell to the ground and remained motionless for a 
                  few seconds. He resumed looking groggy after treatment, promptly 
                  breaking Philippoussis' serve for the first time in the match. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin took the set but Philippoussis roared back to take the 
                  fourth as the Russian wilted and became increasingly frustrated, 
                  several times throwing his racket to the ground in disgust. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The final set went with serve until the very end when Safin 
                  prevailed. <br>
                  <br>
