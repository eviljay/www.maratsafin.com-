                  Tennis Masters Series Hamburg<br>
                  Press conference with MARAT SAFIN<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin versus Hewitt 6:3, 6:1<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Question (Q): That performance must have pleased you? Why?<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: Yes, I think so. I played pretty good today. I was playing 
                  right. I’m very satisfied with my confidence that I have given 
                  here on clay today.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: Why are you playing so well?<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: I didn’t play well last week. I got more matches here. 
                  Today at the beginning of the first set, I was a little bit 
                  nervous, because I played the no. 1 in the world. He’s playing 
                  well on clay and he is an opponent. I made a break in the first 
                  set. The match was fine, I started to find my confidence. I 
                  was hitting the ball well. I was serving well. Everything worked 
                  smoothly.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: Do you know when you are going to play like that, because 
                  then you are almost unstoppable when you do that?<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: Thank you. Sometimes you never know when I’m going to 
                  play like that when I feel that way. I was doing well. Last 
                  week I wasn’t playing really well. I had this difficult match 
                  against Chela yesterday. It was windy, the conditions were not 
                  so well. I managed him in two sets. Today I was playing great. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Q: You kept perfect concentration right through.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: Yes, this is very important to keep your concentration. 
                  Because when you have won the first set you have to be careful 
                  in the beginning of the second set. Because he is more concentrated. 
                  You have to stay with him. I served well. That served my game. 
                  As the race was coming I was feeling great and sure. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q: Are you feeling that you are back on your way to consistency?<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: I hope so. I’m looking for it. I didn’t win a tournament. 
                  I made a few quarter finals, semi finals: I wish to win a tournament 
                  and it will be a different story. I’m on my way to play my best 
                  tennis. I hope this tournament will be a starting point.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: I read about Mats Wilander that he doesn’t follow you on 
                  the tour? So how is the situation, is he still coaching you?<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: No, it is difficult to work and have a family and when 
                  you try to play on the senior tour. We spoke last year that 
                  we are going to try, but for me it’s difficult to travel with 
                  someone only for 20 weeks, because it is not enough. I need 
                  a person who travels with me throughout the whole year. I need 
                  a person fulltime. There is Marc Rosset who is trying to help 
                  me. It is working well. He understands me. He is also a player, 
                  he knows. I hope it was the right decision. I hope I wont get 
                  disappointed. I’m feeling great to work with him since last 
                  year. This year you can see it. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q: How is Marc travelling with you? What’s it specifically you 
                  are trying to get from him?<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: He still tries to play. He’s ranked 106. He tries to 
                  play qualis in Paris. And I think he is going to Wimbledon. 
                  He is travelling with me all the time. He is trying to help 
                  me with my game. I’m trying to get me with my game. Let’s see 
                  if we can manage that he stay in the top 100. This would be 
                  great. We are both tall guys. He knows what things I need. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q: What are these things?<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: You can change your game much. You just have to improve, 
                  to improve. Be more consistent. That is the main thing. Two 
                  years ago I couldn’t volley, I have improved. I improved my 
                  forehand and my backhand. I trying to be more consistent.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: Do you think that when you play your best tennis you can 
                  be no. 1 for quite a long time?<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: I still not no. 1. I was, when I was young (laughing). 
                  I’m trying to get there. That is my goal for sure. To be no. 
                  1 for a long time.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: What distracted you from this way? Everyone said if you keep 
                  that level no one could stop you.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: This if, if, if...if I do this and if I do that. I’m 
                  like this. I have also some weak points in my game. It is more 
                  important for me to get there and stay for a longer time there. 
                  It is important to be more consistent. I have to win more matches. 
                  If I play consistent, then I have the confidence and I’m more 
                  calm. Then it’s like routine.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: What do you think of your personality, is it Russian? Because 
                  Kafelnikov is very acting very similar to you.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: You cannot say that. I left home when I was 14. I started 
                  in a Spanish school, so I can also play on clay. I have an open 
                  mind. I’m not completely Russian, I have been travelling around 
                  the world.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: Do you work harder since a few weeks?<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin: It is not that I work harder. It is just to find the 
                  concentration. For me it is difficult to loose a match. That’s 
                  makes me angry with myself. I’m trying to find the motivation 
                  to keep on trying. I’m still here. I had a few days off. I just 
                  stayed calm to enjoy my live. <br>
