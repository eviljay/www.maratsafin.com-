                          Russian player Marat Safin and his Swedish coach Mats 
                          Wilander have agreed to continue working together for 
                          the first part of next year at least. <br>
                          &quot;I have just spoken with Marat and he said they 
                          had agreed to stay together at least through the Australian 
                          Open,&quot; Russian tennis chief Shamil Tarpishchev 
                          told Reuters on Thursday.<br>
                          &quot;It remains to be seen if they continue working 
                          after that.&quot; <br>
                          Last month Safin said that he would decide on whether 
                          to retain the former world No. 1 as his coach before 
                          the Australian Open which begins on Jan. 14. <br>
                          &quot;I'd like to continue working with Mats on a regular 
                          basis, but it's all depends on his availability,&quot; 
                          said the former U.S. Open champion, who had a disappointing 
                          season in 2001. <br>
                          &quot;The problem is that he is not always able to travel 
                          with me to tournaments, but I hope we can find a solution 
                          to it.&quot; <br>
                          This year Safin was a shadow of the player that in 2000 
                          won seven titles -- the most on the ATP Tour -- including 
                          a shock straight-set victory over Pete Sampras in the 
                          U.S. Open final. <br>
                          But Safin said that the cool-headed Swede, winner of 
                          eight Grand Slam titles, has a positive influence on 
                          his temperamental nature. &quot;It helps to keep me 
                          under control,&quot; he said.<br>

                          Marat Safin tapped the honor as the favorite player 
                          among fans, based on results from an ATPtennis.com poll.

                          vote. <br>
                          Safin, who ended the year in 11th place in the ATP Champions 
                          Race 2001, won two titles in 2001, in Tashkent and St. 
                          Petersburg. He has claimed one Grand Slam title in his 
                          career, at the 2000 US Open.<br>

                          for the Heineken Open 2002 scheduled for 7-12 January. 
                          <br>
                          Tournament Director Graham Pearce said, &quot;One of 
                          the world’s most exciting tennis players is coming to 
                          Auckland to take part in the 2002 Heineken Open and 
                          play in the Vodafone singles&quot;.<br>
                          Safin, aged 21 is currently in 11th place in the year-end 
                          player race and this week on the entry ranking list 
                          is seventh, one behind fellow Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov.<br>
                          After overcoming injury problems earlier this year the 
                          Moscow native proceeded to put in some good performances 
                          in the big events. Safin made the quarterfinals of Wimbledon 
                          before being beaten by Goran Ivanisevic. At Indianapolis 
                          he reached the semifinals going down to Pat Rafter He 
                          then progressed to the semifinals of the US Open losing 
                          to Pete Sampras.<br>
                          The following week he won at Tashkent and just recently 
                          made the semifinals of Lyon.<br>
                          2000 was a marquee year for Safin as he won seven titles, 
                          including the US Open, and two Masters Series events 
                          - Toronto and Paris for a total of nine career titles. 
                          He also topped the list of aces in 2000 with 921 and 
                          is known as one of the hardest groundstoke hitters.<br>
                          Safin challenged for the world number one at the Tennis 
                          Masters Cup in Lisbon in November 2000 after good results 
                          indoors in Europe and is tipped to be a future world 
                          number one.<br>
                          Former world number one, Mats Wilander of Sweden, currently 
                          coaches him and is expected to travel with him to Auckland.<br>
                          It will be Safin’s second time to Auckland. In 1999 
                          as an 18-year-old he played in the Heineken Open winning 
                          his first round over Gianlucca Pozzi of Italy before 
                          being beaten by Kiwi star Brett Steven in the second 
                          round.<br>
                          The Heineken Open featuring the Vodafone singles and 
                          doubles will be held at the ASB BANK Tennis Centre in

                          won on Centre Court at Bercy a year ago. <br>
                          Safin had come back into form in time to win at home 
                          in St Petersburg last week but he admitted the effort 
                          had eaten up what was left of his energy. <br>
                          &quot;Today I couldn't put the ball inside the court. 
                          Today, I was just dead. <br>
                          &quot;Everything was just mad. I couldn't. Mentally 
                          I'm tired. That's the thing,&quot; he said. <br>
                          He said his win in his homeland had taken its toll: 
                          &quot;Too many people, too much going on around us. 
                          I just couldn't anymore, I just couldn't handle it.&quot; 
                          <br>
                          A clear improvement in his form in recent weeks gave 
                          Safin an outside chance of taking the last spot for 
                          the Masters Cup in Sydney on November 12, but he said 
                          he was relieved not to be going. &quot;This year, I 
                          couldn't make the Masters anyway because (Frenchman 
                          Sebastien) Grosjean has been playing too well. I had 
                          no chance,&quot; he said. <br>
                          &quot;It's okay that I'm not going to Sydney. Because 
                          I don't want to go number eight, the last one to catch 
                          the train. For me it doesn't make sense.&quot;<br>
                          Before going on holiday, the Russian said he would have 
                          a talk with former world number one Mats Wilander, who 
                          has coached him this season. <br>
                          There had been rumours that the two might part because 
                          the Swede did not have enough time to give to training 
                          Safin. <br>
                          &quot;We have to discuss things for next year and all 
                          these things. Today or tomorrow I will know my future,&quot; 
                          he said. <br>
                          &quot;I would like to improve something. I think we 
                          both know, so that's why it's important to sit and talk 
                          openly.&quot; <br>
                          Hampered by injury at the beginning of the season, Safin 
                          said he aimed to feature regularly among the top five 
                          players in the world next season if he was fit enough. 
                          <br>
                          &quot;It is not the goal for me to stay number 10, number 
                          seven or even number six. For me the goal is to be in 
                          top five,&quot; he said. &quot;Otherwise it's not interesting 
                          for me. <br>
                          &quot;I think it'll be alright if I start the year well. 
                          I think I have a big chance to be in the top three.&quot;<br>

                          Marat Safin talk about his memorable moments in Bercy, 
                          home of the Tennis Masters Series Paris. <br>
                          It's always good to play Bercy. I also like coming back 
                          to Paris twice a year, for Roland Garros and this. The 
                          atmosphere at this tournament is great. Spectators are 
                          interested in the game and the stadium is almost always 
                          full. That's why I like this event and also because 
                          I've always done well here. I was in the 1999 final 
                          and last year I even won it. <br>
                          Why I succeed in this Masters Series? Simply because 
                          I feel comfortable. Like at home. It's really fun. And 
                          I love spending time in Paris, a wonderful city. <br>
                          My best Bercy moment is undoubtedly last year's victory. 
                          It's when I became No. 1 in the world (after beating 
                          Ferrero in the semis). My Philippoussis five-set final 
                          was extremely tough. I split my eyebrow open during 
                          play, but I still have good memories from that battle. 
                          <br>
                          The crowd is great. The venue is large, so there are 
                          lots of people. They come and watch, have fun. It's 
                          good for the game. They get involved and support the 
                          players a lot.<br>
                          The Stadium holds 15,000. That's amazing. There were 
                          at least 10,000 people for the final last year. It gave 
                          me such a good feeling.<br>

                          A weary Marat Safin successfully defended his title 
                          in the St. Petersburg Open on Sunday, coming back to 
                          defeat Rainer Schuettler of Germany 3-6, 6-3, 6-3. <br>
                          It was Safin's 10th career title and second this year. 
                          He captured his first title of 2001 in Tashkent last 
                          month, beating Yevgeny Kafelnikov in straight sets in 
                          the first all-Russian ATP final.<br>
                          The 25-year-old Schuettler, who was playing in his third 
                          final this year, was broken in the first game of the 
                          match but broke back for 1-1 and again at love in the 
                          fourth game on his way to a 4-1 lead, with Safin smashing 
                          his racket in anger at one point. Schuettler saved two 
                          break points in the ninth game to win the set. <br>
                          Safin drew even with the help of a break in the second 
                          game of the second set, then broke Schuettler in the 
                          third and ninth games of the final set to wrap up the 
                          match. <br>
                          "Yesterday I played six sets and I was dead today on 
                          the court,'' said Safin, who reached the doubles finals 
                          as well. He was wearing a brace on his knee and was 
                          visibly tired.<br>
                          Safin upset second-seeded Kafelnikov in the semifinals 
                          Saturday and beat fifth-seeded Wimbledon champion Goran 
                          Ivanisevic of Croatia in the quarterfinals. <br>
                          Safin is 11th on the ATP Champions Race and the victory 
                          will improve his chances to qualify for the Tennis Masters 
                          Cup in Sydney next month if he performs strongly at 
                          the tournament in Paris next week. <br>
                          "Of course I have to win there (in Paris), but how far 
                          the other players advance will determine that,'' Safin 
                          said. "It's really difficult. I probably have no chance 
                          to go to Sydney because it's not just up to me.''<br>

                          He defeated Yevgeny Kafelnikov to reach the final in 
                          St. Petersburg<br>
                          In an alluring match-up before some 10,000 spectators, 
                          Russia's Marat Safin served up 19 aces en route to his 
                          semifinal victory over countryman Yevgeny Kafelnikov 
                          6-7(4), 6-2, 6-4 in St. Petersburg.<br>
                          &quot;It was the first time we played in Russia,&quot; 
                          said Safin, who now holds a 2-1 record over Kafelnikov. 
                          &quot;We wanted to show the spectators the best we could. 
                          We wanted them to remember this match. I think we both 
                          deserve a lot of credit.&quot;<br>
                          In the match, which lasted about two and a half hours, 
                          Safin didn't let his first-set, tie-break loss affect 
                          his later performance: &quot;He played really well, 
                          especially the first set,&quot; Safin said. &quot;He 
                          played fast, too fast for me. I was a bit lucky. I played 
                          well the big points and fought like a dog. It's a great 
                          effort for me today.&quot;<br>
                          Not only will Safin have an opportunity to defend his 
                          title, but the 21-year-old strengthened his bid for 
                          a spot at next month's Tennis Masters Cup in Sydney. 
                          Safin's now in 11th' place in the ATP Champions Race 
                          2001, but a title win in St. Petersburg and a strong 
                          run at next week's Tennis Masters Series Paris could 
                          earn him one of the remaining slots in the eight-man 
                          Sydney line-up.<br>
                          In Sunday's final, Safin will meet Germany's Rainer 
                          Schuettler, who dismissed France's Michael Llodra 6-3, 
                          6-4. &quot;I did a great job out there, I returned very 
                          well,&quot; said Schuettler, who is playing in his last 
                          event of the year.<br>
                          This is the third final for Schuettler in the past six 
                          weeks. He won the title in Shanghai, and reached the 
                          final in Hong Kong, losing to Marcelo Rios. He defeated 
                          the top seed Juan Carlos Ferrero in the first round 
                          this week, and also stopped Max Mirnyi, the finalist 
                          at last week's Tennis Masters Series Stuttgart, in the 
                          quarterfinals. <br>
                          Although the crowd is expected to be mostly swayed toward 
                          Safin in Sunday's final, Schuettler said it won't bother 
                          him. &quot;It's a great atmosphere here. There are a 
                          lot of spectators, especially the weekend, but they 
                          are fair. I will have no pressure in the final.<br>
                          &quot;I was here last year and lost to [Safin] 6-3 in 
                          the final set in the quarterfinals. Now that I'm playing 
                          the final, for sure I will be back next year.&quot;<br>

                        chances of qualifying for the season-ending Tennis Masters 
                        Cup in Sydney, Australia.<br>
                        &quot;It's difficult to stay back against players like 
                        Ivanisevic because they just throw you off your game,&quot;

                        seed Marat Safin kept alive his hopes of qualifying for 
                        Tennis Masters Cup Sydney when he survived a third-set 
                        tie-break against Spaniard Alberto Martin at the St.Petersburg 
                        Open Thursday. Safin, still short of his best form, won 
                        through to a quarter-final meeting with Goran Ivanisevic 
                        with a 6-7(6), 6-4, 7-6(6) win against Martin in two hours, 
                        35 minutes. <br>
&quot;I knew he was a good player but did not think 
                          he could play so well,&quot; a relieved Safin said. 
                          &quot;This is a great match to get my confidence back, 
                          I'm slowly getting back to my level. I was glad the 
                          crowd supported me; they understood I was not playing 
                          my best tennis and they tried to help me. There are 
                          days like this, I'm not a robot and can't play well 
                          all the time.&quot;<br>
Safin, who qualified for last year's Tennis Masters 
                          Cup Lisboa, is currently 11th in the ATP Champions Race 
                          with 332 points. His mission to qualify for Sydney is 
                          daunting. At the very least he must overhaul seventh-placed 
                          Tommy Haas (who did not add to his 412-point tally this 
                          week after losing here in first round). He must also 
                          hope that ninth-placed Sebastien Grosjean (378 points) 
                          and 10th-placed Tim Henman (377 points) do not also 
                          overtake Haas and raise the qualifying bar higher than 
                          412 points.<br>
Should Safin win St.Petersburg, he would move to 369 
                          points, still 43 points shy of Haas. But he would still 
                          have a chance to qualify with 100 points awaiting the 
                          winner of the final tournament of the year, Tennis Masters 
                          Series Paris, which Safin won last year and reached 
                          the final of in 1999. &quot;It's difficult to plan (for 
                          Sydney) now,&quot; he said. &quot;If I win Paris next 
                          week, then I have a chance.&quot;<br>
But before Safin reaches for the calculator, he must 
                          first tackle Goran Ivanisevic, who all but ensured his 
                          presence in Sydney by beating Felix Mantilla 7-6(8) 
                          7-5. Safin said: <br>
                          &quot;I played him once at Wimbledon and it was very 
                          close - two tie-breaks. He won. It will be difficult 
                          to play him indoors; his serve is excellent. Two or 
                          three points will decide the match.&quot; Ivanisevic 
                          defeated Safin in a fourth-set tie-break in the Wimbledon 
                          quarter-finals this year en route to the title.<br>

                        Marat Safin has a new nemesis in court. Safin, who used 
                        a HEAD Prestige racquet to win the 2000 U.S. Open title, 
                        signed a contract to endorse Dunlop racquets in April 
                        of 2001. But in a complaint filed in the District Court 
                        in Munich, Germany, HEAD contends that Safin has continued 
                        to play with a HEAD Prestige racquet painted over with 
                        the Dunlop logo appearing on the strings. <br>
                        HEAD claimed that Dunlop justified the use of its logo 
                        because it supplies the strings for Safin's racquet. In 
                        its complaint, HEAD charged that the use of Dunlop's logo 
                        was unfair competition as the logo &quot;invariably indicates 
                        the origin of the racquet and not the strings.&quot; <br>
                        The German court granted an injunction against Safin and 
                        Dunlop prohibiting the use of a large logo on the strings 
                        of the racquet. <br>
                        &quot;By no means do we want Marat Safin to stop playing 
                        with his usual racquet with which he secured one of his 
                        greatest victories,&quot; HEAD executive vice president 
                        racquet sports division Robert Marte said in a statement. 
                        &quot;But we don't think it is right to advertise another 
                        brand so flagrantly using our racquet.&quot; <br>
                        Tennis Week is trying to reach Dunlop for its response 
                        to HEAD's charges.<br>

                        Ivan Ljubicic saved a match point before upsetting Marat 
                        Safin, the last surviving seed in the Lyon Grand Prix, 
                        to reach his first final of the season on Saturday.<br>
                        Marat Safin was attempting to capture his second title 
                        in a month after not lifting a trophy during the first 
                        two-thirds of the year. He claimed the President's Cup 
                        at Tashkent, Uzbekistan.</font><font  face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"> 
                        <br>
                        It took three hours, 47 minutes and three tiebreaks for 
                        the unseeded Ljubicic to finish off the third seeded Russian 
                        6-7 (3), 7-6 (4), 7-6 (7) in this extremely tight semifinal 
                        battle.<br>
                        In a tense last set, Safin fought back from three games 
                        down to lead 6-5 in the third tiebreak of the match. <br>
                        But Ljubicic saved his skin the same way he had throughout 
                        the match, at the net. <br>
                        The Croat, who eliminated top seed Gustavo Kuerten in 
                        the first round, made the better start, forcing Safin 
                        to save a set point at 4-5 in the first set.<br>
                        But the former U.S. Open champion responded well and broke 
                        away quickly in the tiebreak to win it 7-3.<br>
                        The second set was almost a photocopy of the first, but 
                        it turned Ljubicic's way as the Croat, 4-2 down in the 
                        tiebreak, scored five points in succession to level at 
                        one set all.<br>
                        Stunned by the loss of the set, Safin was forced to fight 
                        an uphill battle from 1-4 down to a third tiebreak in 
                        which his calmer opponent finally prevailed.<br>
                        The Russian led 6-5 but missed two easy backhands and 
                        handed victory to Ljubicic.<br>
                        Incredibly, even the first of their three career meetings 
                        (in Sydney last year) went to one tie-break, meaning they've 
                        gone the distance in eight of the 10 sets they've played.
                 <br>
&quot;I talked with Marat in the locker room after 
                          the match, and said we should automatically play a tie-break 
                          the next time we play, so we can save energy,&quot; 
                          said Ljubicic, who is seeking his first career title.<br>
                        Safin, who failed to convert on his one match point, said 
                        the third set came down to &quot;pure luck.&quot; He felt, 
                        however, that he had chances to close out the match in 
                        the second set. &quot;In the second set tie-break, I was 
                        up 4-2 and missed two shots,&quot; he said. &quot;I was 
                        still thinking about that in the beginning of the third 
                        set, and how I could be in the locker room already.&quot;</font></td>

                        Marat Safin beat Max Mirnyi of Belarus for the second 
                        time in a week, scoring a 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory Friday 
                        to reach the semifinals of the $800,000 Lyon Grand Prix. 
                        <br>
                        The third-seeded Russian, his temper flaring in the third 
                        set, will next play Croatia's Ivan Ljubicic.<br>
                        Safin defeated Mirnyi in the first round of the Kremlin 
                        Cup in Moscow before exiting the tournament in the next 
                        round. <br>
                        Marat Safin, a late entrant at Lyon and playing as a wild 
                        card, has won only one title this year. He won seven last 
                        year, including the U.S. Open. <br>
                        He is 11th in the ATP Champions Race and his chances of 
                        qualifying for the year-end Masters Cup in Sydney, Australia, 
                        are slender. Only the top seven players are guaranteed 
                        a place. <br>
                        Safin stumbled through the opening set, losing it with 
                        a double fault. He recovered to win the second, then his 
                        temper flared. <br>
                        After setting up an easy drop shot for Mirnyi, the Russian 
                        cursed himself and waved his hands in frustration. Later, 
                        he stretched to reach a forehand, missed and fell face 
                        down.<br>
                        Mirnyi conceded a decisive break in the seventh game. 
                        Safin cruised through his next two service games to win 
                        the match.<br>
                        &quot;It was tough to play against Max,&quot; Safin said. 
                        &quot;With his serve and volley it's difficult to get 
                        any rhythm. It was difficult to concentrate. In the first 
                        set he served well and I had no chance. In the second 
                        set I had the chance to change the match. I didn't serve 
                        really well. I had two double faults, which never happened 
                        before. But I stayed in the match and I fought.&quot;</font></td>

                        <br>
                        The third-seeded Safin, the 2000 U.S. Open champion, needed 
                        just 70 minutes to advance at the $800,000 tournament.<br>
                        Marat Safin easily beat Israeli qualifier Noam Okun in 
                        straight sets at the Lyon Grand Prix and then revealed 
                        he might end his partnership with coach Mats Wilander 
                        next season.<br>
                        "Between his family, his matches on the Senior Tour, Mats 
                        is a very busy man and he can only give me 20 weeks a 
                        year,'' Safin said.<br>
                        "During the Paris Open, we will sit down and discuss next 
                        season. Maybe we'll go on, maybe we'll stop,'' the third 
                        seed said.<br>
                        Safin took on the former world number one as his coach 
                        this season after a poor run of form following his 2000 
                        U.S. Open (news - web sites) title win.<br>
                        He received a wild card to play in Lyon in a last ditch 
                        attempt to qualify for the Masters Cup in Sydney, but 
                        admitted it was a distant hope.<br>
                        &quot;I'm here to win points. The aim is to make it to 
                        the Masters Cup but honestly, it looks very far away,'' 
                        he said.<br>
                        &quot;At best, I'll finish the season in 7th place, at 
                        worst I'll be 15th. What really matters is to be in the 
                        top three.''<br>
                        Safin made a bad start against Okun, losing his first 
                        service game. But it was only a hiccup as he broke back 
                        in the eighth game before cruising to victory in 69 minutes.<br>
                        Safin now meets Belarus Max Mirnyi in the quarterfinals, 
                        whom he struggled to beat last week in Moscow.<br>
                        &quot;With Max, it's all or nothing. He can play great, 
                        but even he does not know when,'' said Safin.</font></td>

                        Despite being cheered to a come-from-behind victory in 
                        front of his hometown fans the day before, Marat Safin 
                        saw his crowd and fortunes turn on Thursday.<br>
                        Marat Safin, the second seed, suffered a surprising 6-0, 
                        4-6, 7-6 (7-5) second-round loss to Slovakia's Dominik 
                        Hrbaty, highlighting a day which saw a combined six seeded 
                        players knocked out of the men's and women's draws in 
                        the $2.19 million Kremlin Cup at Olympic Stadium.<br>
                        As unexpected as Safin's setback was the reaction of the 
                        crowd. After serving for the match at 5-4 only to lose 
                        the third-set tiebreaker, Safin was booed off the court 
                        by the supposedly partisan fans. That negative reception 
                        prompted Safin to declare he would never play in Russia 
                        again.<br>
                        &quot;It was a terrible feeling to hear the fans whistle 
                        and boo me on the court,&quot; said an emotionally-drained 
                        Safin as he wiped sweat off of his forehead.<br>
&quot;To be honest, I have lost all desire to play 
                          in Russia ever again. I have never been so humiliated 
                          in my whole life.&quot;
                        <br>
                        Buoyed by the support of the crowd Wednesday, Safin rallied 
                        to defeat Max Mirnyi of Belarus in the first round.<br>
                        The 21-year-old Safin was trying to make a late-season 
                        bid to qualify for the Tennis Masters Cup in Sydney in 
                        mid-November. He is 11th in the ATP Champions Race, with 
                        five of eight spots still up for grabs.</font></td>

                        Russia's Marat Safin, backed by a hometown crowd, advanced 
                        to the second round of the Kremlin Cup in Moscow. <br>
The 21-year-old Safin, who was born in Moscow, defeated 
                          Max Mirnyi of Belarus 5-7, 6-4, 6-4. Although Safin 
                          is happy to playing in familiar territory, he admitted 
                          to feeling added pressure.<br>
&quot;It's nice but also difficult to play here in 
                          Moscow,&quot; said Safin. &quot;They expect so much 
                          from me. I have to show them everything I can do on 
                          a court. I'm under a lot of pressure to do well. But 
                          I also like to see so many people enjoying the tennis.&quot;<br>
The Russian set up a second round meeting with the 
                          Slovak Republic's Dominik Hrbaty, who has beaten Safin 
                          five out of the nine times the pair have met. Safin 
                          is currently 11th in the ATP Champions Race 2001 and 
                          came one match away from finishing last year as the 
                          top player in the world.<br>
&quot;I'm still a little bit far from the form of last

                        The 21-year-old Safin defended his crown here and recorded 
                        his ninth career title after leading the Tour with seven 
                        last year. He earned $74,000 for the victory.<br>
                        It marked only the second all-Russian final in ATP history. 
                        In 1994, Kafelnikov defeated fellow Russian Alexander 
                        Volkov at Adelaide for his first career title.<br>
                        Safin, who improved to 12-2 here, avenged a 6-1, 6-2 defeat 
                        to Kafelnikov at Rome in 1999, evening the series with 
                        his compatriot at one win apiece.<br>
                        Safin and Kafelnikov made history at last week's U.S. 
                        Open, becoming the first pair of Russians to advance to 
                        the semifinal of the same Grand Slam.<br>
                        However, neither advanced any further. Safin was dethroned 
                        by Pete Sampras and Kafelnikov was trounced by eventual 
                        champion Lleyton Hewitt.<br>
                        Safin has picked up his play of late as he also reached 
                        the semifinals of the RCA Championships prior to the U.S. 
                        Open.<br>
                        The erratic Kafelnikov has won once this year, claiming 
                        the Marseilles Open in February with a straight-sets victory 
                        over France's Sebastien Grosjean. He is 13-5 in Tashkent, 
                        reaching the final in 1998.<br>
                        In last year's President's Cup final, Safin defeated Italy's

                        Marat Safin and Yevgeny Kafelnikov just barely set up 
                        only the second all-Russian ATP final on Saturday at the 
                        $550,000 President's Cup tennis tournament.<br>
                        Safin, the top seed and defending champion, rallied after 
                        dropping the first-set tiebreak to edge Armenian Sargis 
                        Sargsian, 6-7 (3-7), 6-3, 7-6 (7-5), in the semifinals 
                        at this former Soviet city. No. 2 Kafelnikov outlasted 
                        his nemisis, the third-seeded Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia, 
                        6-7 (8-10), 6-2, 7-6 (10-8).<br>
                        Sargsian made two errors against Safin in the final tiebreak, 
                        losing the set and the match.<br>
&quot;I had a chance to win the first set 6-4 but I 
                          lost that set and then I got nervous and until the end 
                          of the match I seriously did not feel confident in myself,&quot; 
                          Safin said.<br>
&quot;We both played nervously and allowed ourselves 
                          to make lots of mistakes.&quot;
                        <br>
                        Kafelnikov won the only previous all-Russian final in 
                        ATP history in 1994, when he defeated Alexander Volkov 
                        at Adelaide for his first career title.<br>
                        He also beat Safin in their only previous meeting in 1999, 
                        when Kafelnikov routed his compatriot, 6-1, 6-2.<br>
                        &quot;It will be great to play Yevgeny,&quot; Safin said.<br>
                        &quot;We want the final to to be like this every weeek,&quot; 
                        Kafelnikov said. &quot;It's a big sensation and the President's 
                        Cup can be proud of it.&quot;<br>
                        Safin and Kafelnikov made history at last week's U.S.

                        Safin, who improved his record here to 11-2, is looking 
                        for his first title this year after winning a tour-leading 
                        seven last season. His play has picked up of late as he 
                        also reached the semifinals of the RCA Championships prior

                        Kafelnikov, the 1998 runner-up here, won for just the

                        Top-seeded Russians Marat Safin took another step Friday 
                        toward his anticipated showdown, moving into the semifinals 
                        of the $550,000 President's Cup tennis tournament.<br>
                        The 21-year-old Safin, defending champion at the President's 
                        Cup, struggled in his quarterfinal match against Denmark's 
                        Kristian Pless, but managed a 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 victory.<br>
                        Marat Safin is looking for his first title this year after 
                        winning seven last season. However, his play has picked 
                        up of late as he also reached the semifinals of the RCA 
                        Championships prior to the U.S. Open. <br>
                        Safin's next opponent will be Sargsian, who held on to 
                        defeat the fourth-seeded Schalken, 7-6 (7-2), 2-6, 6-4.<br>
                        Safin has never played Sargsian, but he believes he must 
                        improve his form to have any chance of defending his title. 
                        &quot;If he (Sargsian) plays well, he'll beat me, I guarantee 
                        you,&quot; Safin said after struggling in his quarterfinal 
                        match.<br>
                        In his match with Pless, Safin said he merely waited for 
                        mistakes from his opponent. &quot;He played pretty well, 
                        and began the second set well...but then he started to 
                        crack and didn't get it together at all in the third set,&quot; 
                        Safin said.<br>

                        Olympic champion Marc Rosset 6-4, 7-6, changing up a gear 
                        in the tiebreak to quash any hopes the rangy Swiss had 
                        of a comeback. <br>
                        After Safin won the first set he broke Rosset, his doubles 
                        partner at this tournament, in the opening game of the 
                        second set. The hard-serving Swiss tied it 2-2 and both 
                        held serve, forcing the tiebreaker. Safin fired an ace 
                        to win the tiebreaker 7-3.<br>
                        &quot;He [Rosset] played pretty well... but in the tiebreak 
                        he got scared of himself, thought he might beat me and 
                        got nervous and started to make mistakes,&quot; the 21-year-old 
                        Safin told a news conference after his 86-minute win. 
                        <br>
                        Before the US Open, Safin seemed to have little chance 
                        of being among the Top 8 players in Sydney as he languished 
                        in 29th position in the ATP Champions Race. But a semifinal 
                        appearance at Flushing Meadows and a good start in Tashkent 
                        has the Russian believing that he can qualify for the 
                        Tennis Masters Cup.<br>
                        &quot;I'm going to play Hong Kong, Moscow and St.Petersburg 
                        because I want to do my best to make the Tennis Masters 
                        Cup,&quot; said Safin, who last year was one match away 
                        from finishing the season as the inaugural ATP Champions 
                        Race winner.<br>
                        &quot;It's been a difficult year for me with injury, and 
                        I haven't had a lot of opportunities to play against the 
                        top players. That's why I found it difficult in the semifinals 
                        at the US Open.&quot;<br>
                        Safin said he was devastated by the terrorist attacks 
                        in the United States.<br>
                        &quot;I have many friends in New York and I've been watching 
                        CNN for 24 hours a day,'' he said. &quot;I'm shocked, 
                        angry and pained.'' <br>
                        Safin will meet Denmark's Kristian Pless, who beat local 
                        favorite Oleg Ogorodov 6-3 6-2. The Uzbek failed to find 
                        the form which took him past last year's finalist Davide 
                        Sanguinetti of Italy in the first round. <br>

                        to capture the fifth of his seven titles in 2000.<br>
                        After suffering from a number of injuries on the ATP circuit

                        Safin's confidence grew and he began making big shots. 
                        Sampras, equipped with one of the best serves in tennis, 
                        still would not yield.<br>
                        Facing a break of serve, he benefited when chair umpire 
                        Wayne McKewen overruled an out call and awarded him an 
                        ace. He converted that by holding his service, extending 
                        his streak to 81 service games without being broken.<br>
                        Trading shot for shot, the two men rolled through the 
                        set into a tiebreak. It was familiar territory for Sampras, 
                        who played four tiebreak sets in his classic quarterfinal 
                        victory over Andre Agassi two nights earlier.<br>
                        Sampras' 16th ace of the match put him one point away. 
                        Safin saved one set point but hit long on the next, giving 
                        Sampras the set.<br>
                        Safin has never come back after losing the first two sets. 
                        A double fault put the Russian in trouble in the fourth 
                        game of the third set and Sampras converted with a return 
                        that just caught the back line. He kissed his racket in 
                        appreciation.<br>
                        Sampras went into overdrive after that. His big serve 
                        produced 20 aces, the final one on match point, and he 
                        extended his streak of service games without being broken 
                        to 87.<br>
                        The combustible Safin twice complained over calls - one 
                        a foot fault, the second a shot that brushed the line. 
                        For the most part, he kept his temper under control. He 
                        had enough to worry about with Sampras on the other side 
                        of the net.<br>
                        Sampras wanted to make a statement against Safin. A year 
                        ago, the Russian beat him in the Open finals for his first 
                        and only Grand Slam victory. It seemed as if it might 
                        signal a changing of the guard with Safin just 19 and 
                        Sampras almost 30.<br>
                        A year ago, Sampras reached the final and was a heavy 
                        favorite against Safin. He was stung in three sets, a 
                        loss that weighed heavily on him.<br>
Meanwhile, Safin struggled this year with injuries, 
                          unable to translate his first Slam triumph into any 
                          kind of consistency. After winning seven titles last 
                          year, he came into the Open without any championships 
                          this year.<br>

                        Explosive No. 3 seed Marat Safin, continuing his title 
                        defense, unraveled Argentina's Mariano Zabaleta in straight 
                        sets 6-4, 6-4, 6-2, Wednesday on Arthur Ashe Stadium in 
                        a match that had both players seeing red. A frustrated 
                        Zabaleta missed crucial opportunities to score when it 
                        seemed like nothing he tried was working for him, and 
                        Safin let slip by six points in a row in the second set.<br>
                        The towering Russian showed some hustle in his serve-and-volley 
                        game in the third set and during an impressive run that 
                        had him at the net and back to hit one between the legs. 
                        Safin also smashed seven aces to Zabaleta's three and 
                        had 26 winners to the Argentine's 17 in the 1-hour, 47-minute

                        and 32 minutes to be able to dispatch Sweden’s Thomas

                        Safin who won his ticket to the quarters with a four set

                        Defending champion Marat Safin moved into the fourth round 
                        with a 7-5 6-4 7-6 (7-5) win over Hicham Arazi of Morocco 
                        on Saturday. The third seed spent two hours and 31 minutes 
                        on court carving out victory over the crafty Arazi.<br>
Safin hit 12 aces and won 88 percent of the points 
                          when his first serve went in.<br>
The Russian played his usual daring style of tennis, 
                          cracking 40 outright winners in the match. At the three 
                          other Grand Slams this year, Safin reached the fourth 
                          round in Australia, the third round at the French Open 
                          and the quarter-finals at Wimbledon.<br>
Safin will next play 14th seed Thomas Johansson of 
                          Sweden.<br>
After nearly a year of frustration, defending champion 
                          Safin appears to be back in winning mode.<br>
&quot;The way I'm playing, I'm quite sure and I'm quite 
                          confident in myself,&quot; said Safin following his 
                          7-5 6-4 7-6 (7-5) third round victory over Hicham Arazi 
                          of Morocco on Saturday. &quot;I feel comfortable on 
                          the court.&quot;<br>
The 21-year-old was a shining star of the tennis circuit 
                          in 2000, not only winning his first Grand Slam crown 
                          at the U.S. Open but leading the tour by picking up 
                          seven titles in the year. After jockeying for supremacy 
                          with Gustavo Kuerten at the season-ending Tennis Masters 
                          Cup, the Brazilian took the top honours while Safin 
                          had to settle for being number two in the world.<br>
From being a fearsome factor in 2000, Safin fell away 
                          this year when he suffered a back injury in the Dubai 
                          final in February.<br>
After retiring from the Dubai final against Juan Carlos 
                          Ferrero of Spain, the Russian took a couple of months 
                          off and then returned to the tour with little self-belief. 
                          But Safin's year started to turn around when he reached 
                          the quarter-finals at Wimbledon in July, and then two 
                          weeks ago he was a semi-finalist at Indianapolis.<br>
&quot;Everything is there,&quot; Safin said. &quot;I 
                          have very good motivation right now. It's unbelievable.&quot;<br>
Safin's next challenge is Johansson and the pair have 
                          met twice in their careers - both this year - and have 
                          won one apiece. As far as Safin is concerned, Johansson 
                          is the next hurdle in his attempt to win the U.S. Open 
                          trophy for a second consecutive year.<br>
                        &quot;The beginning of the tournament is 128 players and 
                        everybody wants to win,&quot; he said. &quot;Now it's 
                        only the last 16 players so it's getting closer and closer 
                        and I have more chances to win. Every time it's less and 
                        less persons playing tennis. Second week I'm going to 
                        be very dangerous, for sure.&quot;</font></td>

                        When things go wrong, as they often do for Marat Safin, 
                        he cocks his head and flails his arms like a conductor 
                        trying to coax every ounce of drama from a Russian symphony.<br>
                        There were discordant moments and attacks of angst Thursday 
                        at the U.S. Open before despair ultimately turned to triumph 
                        for Safin. He nearly exhausted his allotment of tiebreakers 
                        but outlasted big-serving Croat Ivan Ljubicic in the second 
                        round, 7-6 (5), 6-7 (2), 7-6 (5), 7-6 (5).<br>
                        For nearly 3? hours, Ljubicic had the demonstrative defending 
                        champion flailing, and then some. Safin buried his head 
                        in his hands, slammed balls into the net and directed 
                        at least one obscene gesture toward himself.<br>
                        &quot;I'm like this. I can't change,&quot; he said. &quot;It's 
                        difficult to play the other way -- to be quiet on the 
                        court and nice to everybody. I'm getting angry with me, 
                        my coach, my father, everybody.&quot;<br>
                        He smiled and noted: &quot;I'm doing better. I didn't 
                        break any rackets today.&quot;<br>
                        Perhaps only because he won. Safin, trying to shake a 
                        yearlong slump compounded by injuries, rarely looked like 
                        the player who stunned the tennis world by routing Pete 
                        Sampras in last year's final.<br>
                        But in the tiebreakers Safin was poised, aggressive and 
                        a little lucky, and he closed out the win with a 136 mph 
                        ace.<br>
                        &quot;I was a little bit scared but passed through,&quot; 
                        he said. &quot;My tennis is coming back. Each time I feel 
                        better and better.&quot;<br>
                        After winning the first-set tiebreak, Safin was up 3-0 
                        in the second when Ljubicic took an injury timeout. ATP 
                        trainer Juergen Dess massaged his lower back as the Croatian 
                        player lay face down on center court at Arthur Ashe Stadium.<br>
                        The treatment worked. Ljubicic recovered and the two men 
                        traded serves of over 130 mph. Each player managed just 
                        one break and their huge serves produced a combined 37 
                        aces, 21 for Ljubicic and 16 for Safin. Ljubicic made 
                        65 unforced errors to 38 for Safin.<br>
                        The end came on Safin's third match point after he had 
                        often been frustrated by mistakes that left him with his 
                        head hanging.<br>
                        Only 21, Safin fears he has already peaked, and he's dubious 
                        about recapturing the form that overwhelmed Sampras a 
                        year ago.<br>
                        &quot;It was too perfect,&quot; Safin said. &quot;I cannot 
                        play like this all the time. It can happen once in my 
                        life -- last year.&quot;<br>
                        As if to prove it, in 2001 Safin hasn't won a tournament 
                        and has reached only one final. His best Grand Slam showing 
                        came at Wimbledon, where he advanced to the quarterfinals 
                        before losing to Ivanisevic. He has been slowed by back 
                        and knee injuries but says he's healthy now.<br>
                        Safin went through three coaches in 2000 and this year 
                        hired seven-time Grand Slam champion Mats Wilander, who 
                        has worked with the Russian on his tactics and temper.<br>
                        &quot;I'm not so confident like last year, so I have to 
                        start from the beginning, from the basics,&quot; Safin 
                        said. &quot;Had a bad year _ a horrible year, I could 
                        say. Better times will come for sure. I want to win a 
                        few more Grand Slam tournaments, and it will be perfect.<br>
                        &quot;And I will win,&quot; he added with a laugh. &quot;Otherwise 
                        I shoot myself.&quot;<br>

                        &quot;The first match is always difficult,&quot; said 
                        Safin, who won an ATP-best seven titles last year but 
                        is winless in 2001. &quot;You need to have one or two 
                        tough matches. I think it will give me a lot of confidence 
                        these kinds of matches.&quot;<br>
Safin battled an elbow problem early in the season 
                          before injuring his back during the final of the Dubai 
                          Tennis Championships in March.<br>
&quot;I was tired (at the beginning of the year), then 
                          I was injured and I started to change the racquet. Then 
                          I lost my confidence,&quot; he said. &quot;It's all 
                          the time something happen to me. But right now it's 
                          (almost) the end of the season. I'm trying to make some 
                          good results. And it would be great if I could win here 
                          because of the way I played all year.&quot;

                        Defending US Open Champion, Marat Safin, and adidas have 
                        extended their partnership. The 21-year-old Russian has 
                        already reached at least the round of 16 at each of the 
                        four Grand Slams, proving that he is a dangerous player 
                        on any surface. He finished the 2000 season as the #2 
                        ranked player in the world. <br>
Safin made headlines for the first time in 1998 with 
                          his 4th round showing at Roland Garros, his first Grand 
                          Slam event. He upset former champions Gustavo Kuerten 
                          and Andre Agassi back to back along the way. He steadily 
                          worked his way up the rankings throughout 1998 and 1999. 
                          Safin won an ATP Tour leading seven tournaments in 2000. 
                          His US Open win over Pete Sampras vaulted Safin to the 
                          top of the world rankings, making him the youngest ever 
                          number one at 20 years and seven months. <br>
Battling injuries throughout the 2001 season, Safin 
                          has reached one final, one semifinal and the quarterfinals 
                          at Wimbledon this year. Safin is seeded third for this 
                          year's US Open and appears to be hitting his stride 
                          at just the right time, saying, 'I look forward to defending 
                          my title here. The support that I received from the 
                          fans here last year is a great memory. I hope that I 
                          give them something to cheer about this year as well.' 
                      <br>
Marat Safin has been with adidas throughout his professional 
                          career. Safin is at the top of a group of impressive 
                          young players that are leading tennis into a new era. 
                          The new contract is a long-term deal that further solidifies 
                          adidas' position as the leading performance tennis brand. 
                          Safin is currently playing in the adidas Barricade II 
                          shoe and the adidas Performance Top and Short.

                        US Open champion Marat Safin on Thursday August 23 at 
                        5 p.m. ET. <br>
Safin won the US Open last year defeating Pete Sampras 
                          in the finals in straight sets for his first Grand Slam 
                          title. He lost only one set during his final four matches. 
                      <br>
Safin led the ATP in 2000 with seven titles and became 
                          the youngest player to finish at No. 2 in the rankings 
                          since a 19-year-old Boris Becker did it in 1986. He 
                          also became the first player under the age of 21 to 
                          win at least seven titles in a season since 1983. He 
                          led the ATP with 73 singles matches won, finals reached 
                          (9) and was second in singles matches played (100). 
                    <br>
Last year, Safin won $3,524,959 and he has a career 
                          record of 129-78. His highest ranking came on November 
                          20, 2000 when he reached No. 1. <br>

                        Patrick Rafter edged second seed Marat Safin, 6-3, 5-7, 
                        7-6 (9-7), to advance to the final of the $800,000 RCA 
                        Championships.<br>
                        Marat Safin, a finalist here a year ago, had won three 
                        straight matches for the first time since reaching the 
                        quarterfinals at Wimbledon.<br>
                        The first match ever between Rafter and Safin lasted 2 
                        hours, 17 minutes and was even in nearly every statistical 
                        category. Each player had one service break and each had 
                        44 winners.<br>
Rafter won 110 points, Safin 107.<br>
The simplest of all might have been the match's last 
                          point.<br>
                        &quot;It was too easy,'' Safin said. &quot;I wanted to 
                        put the ball away. I lost my concentration, made a stupid 
                        mistake.''</font></td>

                        Marat Safin beat Sweden's Thomas Enqvist to advance to 
                        the semifinals of the RCA Championships.<br>
                        Second-seeded Safin, who lost to Kuerten in last year's 
                        final, meets Patrick Rafter in the other semifinal. <br>
                        Marat Safin won 7-5, 6-4, advancing into a tournament 
                        semifinal for the first time since early March in Dubai, 
                        United Arab Emirates. In that tournament, Safin quit during 
                        the final with a back injury and has struggled since. 
                        <br>
                        The eighth-seeded Enqvist never broke Safin, who had nine 
                        aces with only one double fault while saving eight break 
                        points.<br>
&quot;I was confident, serving well, playing smart,&quot; 
                          said Safin, seeking his first title of 2001. Last year, 
                          he became the first player under 21 to win seven in 
                          a season since 1983. <br>
&quot;My confidence is coming back,&quot; Safin said. 
                          &quot;I feel comfortable on the court. At least I can 
                          play tennis.&quot; <br>
Perhaps some of the credit belongs to his current coach, 
                          Mats Wilander, who was the last player to win seven 
                          events in a single year before turning 21. <br>
&quot;You can't change many things,&quot; he said. 
                          &quot;I'm just playing a little bit smarter, you have 
                          to see the [opponent's] weakest part and attack it.&quot; 
                      <br>
Until he arrived at the Indianapolis Tennis Center, 
                          the defending U.S. Open champion was struggling and 
                          failed to win a set in three consecutive matches. <br>
Safin will take next week off to practice and work 
                          with Wilander in preparation for the U.S. Open. <br>
&quot;If I play like this, I have a chance,&quot; Safin 
                          said. &quot;It is very difficult to defend a title in 
                          such a big tournament. I still believe I can make a 
                          good result. You just have to get by those early matches.&quot;

The 21-year-old Russian seemed on the verge of dropping 
                          the first set, when he rebounded and won the tie-break. 
                          He then cruised through the second set, only losing 
                          one game. The third-round victory marked Safin's third 
                          win in his last seven matches.<br>
Safin lost his only previous meeting with Robredo,

                        Third seed Marat Safin puts his injured knee to the test

                        Series Cincinnati.<br>
                        Last week at the Tennis Masters Series event in Montreal, 
                        Marat Safin was trailing Frenchman Nicolas Escude, 6-4, 
                        5-2, when he was forced to retire with a knee injury. 
                        The knee ailment first became apparent to the 21-year-old 
                        Russian during Wimbledon, but he was not concerned until 
                        the tour moved to the hard courts.<br>
Safin still is seeking his first tournament victory 
                          of the season after capturing an ATP-leading seven last 
                          year. He has lost four of his last five matches and 
                          is just 10-10 on hard courts this season.<br>
                        His current form is in sharp contrast to last year when 
                        he won one tournament and appeared in another final before 
                        claiming his first career Grand Slam title at the U.S.

                        Defending champion Marat Safin was booed off court Monday 
                        after quitting with a knee injury when trailing Frenchman 
                        Nicolas Escude 6-4, 5-2 in the first round of the Montreal 
                        Masters.<br>
The Russian second seed said there was no point carrying 
                          on with the problem he first felt at Wimbledon and re-aggravated 
                          last week in Los Angeles.<br>
&quot;It hurt when I had to serve and I couldn't run,&quot; 
                          the 21-year-old said. &quot;After he broke me twice 
                          in the second set, I just gave up -- what could I do?&quot; 
                       <br>
Safin complained bitterly about his treatment at the 
                          hands of disappointed Montreal fans.<br>
&quot;They should try to understand, I'm injured,&quot; 
                          he said. &quot;It's easy to sit in the stands eating 
                          popcorn and drinking beer.&quot; <br>
Reminded that this was a hockey town where injuries 
                          are normally overlooked, Safin defended his actions 
                          again. <br>
&quot;I'm trying, what can I do?,&quot; he added. &quot;I 
                          don't think it's right to waste the spectators' time 
                          and the opponent's time by playing another game or two.&quot; 
                       <br>
The Russian U.S. Open champion remained unsure about 
                          his immediate future. <br>
&quot;I think my U.S. season may be short,&quot; he 
                          said.

                        Russian Marat Safin begins defense of his Tennis Masters 
                        series title Monday when he plays Nicolas Escude of France 
                        at the $2.95 million hardcourt tennis event.<br>
Safin, seeded second, is still seeking his first tournament 
                          victory of the season after capturing an ATP-leading 
                          seven last year. He defeated Harel Levy of Israel in 
                          the 2000 final and claimed his first Grand Slam title 
                          one month later at the U.S. Open.<br>
The 21-year-old Safin begin his summer hardcourt season 
                          last week at the Mercedes-Benz Cup in Los Angeles, losing 
                          to Xavier Malisse in the second round. He is just 10-9 
                          on hard courts but was hampered most of the season with 
                          a back injury suffered in the final at Dubai in February.<br>
Safin, who has lost three of his last four matches, 
                          also is looking to become the first repeat champion 
                          at this event since Andre Agassi claimed consecutive 
                          crowns in 1994-95.</font>

                        broke away from the tennis courts at UCLA to journey to 
                        the world famous Playboy Mansion. The mansion located 
                        just a short drive from the courts is home to Playboy 
                        Magazine founder Hugh Hefner, who gave out special invitations 
                        the players to stop by for a visit. Safin, the reigning 
                        US Open champion, was there Sunday night for dinner with 
                        Hefner and several of the magazine's popular Playmates, 
                        including Miss March 2000. After a poolside buffet, Safin 
                        was led into the house for a private viewing of the new 
                        movie &quot;American Sweethearts.&quot; Goldstein and

                        Marat Safin, who many observers believe is poised to become 
                        the new dominant player in men’s tennis, has committed 
                        to play in the 2001 Mercedes-Benz Cup, presented by Balance 
                        Bar, July 23-29, 2001 at the Los Angeles Tennis Center-UCLA, 
                        tournament director Bob Kramer announced.<br>
                        Safin dominated the ATP tour in 2000 and became the youngest 
                        player to finish No. 2 since Boris Becker in 1986. He 
                        was the first player under the age of 21 to win at least 
                        seven titles in a season since Mats Wilander won nine 
                        in 1983. Safin reached 10 finals and won at Barcelona, 
                        Mallorca, Montreal, Toronto, U.S. Open, Tashkent, St. 
                        Petersburg and Paris Indoor. He was runner-up at Hamburg, 
                        World Team Cup in Dusseldorf, Germany and Indianapolis, 
                        reached the semifinals at Copenhagen, Moscow and Tennis 
                        Masters Cup and the quarterfinals at the French Open and 
                        London/Queen-s Club. His straight sets victory at the 
                        U.S. Open over Pete Sampras was his first Grand Slam title, 
                        and he became the first player to win an ATP title the 
                        following week of a Grand Slam title since 1985 when he 
                        won at Tashkent. This year, Safin reached the finals in 
                        Dubai and the World Team Cup in Dusseldorf, the quarterfinals 
                        in Milan and the fourth round of the Australian Open. 
                        A winner of 10 career singles titles, he recorded his 
                        first win in 1999 in Boston.<br>
                        “We are extremely delighted that Marat has committed for 
                        the 2001 tournament,” Kramer said. “He is an exciting 
                        young talent who has captured the imagination of tennis 
                        fans throughout the world with his outstanding play this 
                        year. His early commitment is a wonderful start to our 
                        player field for our diamond anniversary tournament, which 
                        promises to be something very special on the summer’s 
                        sports and social calendar.”<br>
                        Not the least of those impressed by Safin was Sampras.<br>
                        “The way he’s playing, he’s the future of the game,” Sampras 
                        said after Safin became the youngest Grand Slam champion 
                        since Sampras in 1990. “He’s more powerful than I was 
                        at 19. He’s more developed. He serves harder. He doesn’t 
                        have many holes (in his game) and he moves well for a 
                        big (6’4”) guy.”</font></td>

                        Top-seeded Marat Safin and Swiss Roger Federer were first-round 
                        losers at the Swiss Open on Tuesday. <br>
                        Safin, the U.S. Open champion who reached the quarterfinals 
                        of Wimbledon last week, bowed 6-4, 6-7 (4) 6-4 to Spaniard 
                        Juan Balcells. <br>
                        Safin, who lost to eventual champion Goran Ivanisevic 
                        in the quarterfinals of Wimbledon, struggled visibly against 
                        Balcells, one of the few Spanish serve and volley specialists. 
                        <br>
                        &quot;There wasn't enough time to prepare for the tournament 
                        (after Wimbledon),'' said Safin, who also lost to Balcells 
                        earlier this year in Miami. &quot;I came from grass court 
                        and it was tough to come here on clay. <br>
                        &quot;All the balls were really flying and I was a little 
                        bit scared so I was pushing the ball and there was nothing 
                        else I could do.''<br>
                        Federer and Safin will attempt to make up for their disappointing 
                        performances, teaming up for the doubles event. &quot;We 
                        want to win in the doubles for the people,'' Safin said. 
                        &quot;They want to see Roger win and he wants to show 
                        them how he can play.''</font></td>

                        In the 1/4 final Marat Safin (4) lost to Goran Ivanisevic 
                        (CRO) 7-6(7-2), 7-5, 3-6, 7-6(7-3).<br>
                        When Safin's last shot landed long, Ivanisevic celebrated 
                        the latest step in his improbable comeback. He ran along 
                        the baseline toward the stands, yanked off his shirt and 
                        tossed it to cheering fans. <br>
                        The Croatian then stood bare-chested on a chair by the 
                        side of the court, smiling broadly and lifting his arms. 
                        He had climbed a long way from barely making the tournament 
                        as a wild-card entry to becoming the first wild card to 
                        reach the Wimbledon semifinals. 
                        <br>
&quot;I am the guy who can just wake up one day and 
                          beat anybody,&quot; he said. <br>
Safin didn't challenge that view, not after being hammered 
                          by 30 aces and wondering if he could even return Ivanisevic's 
                          130 mph serves. <br>
                        &quot;If he plays like he played today, I think he will 
                        not have any problems&quot; winning the tournament, said 
                        the fourth-seeded Safin, a Russian who won last year's 
                        U.S. Open. <br>
                        Safin was looking to become the first Russian semifinalist 
                        at Wimbledon. Alex Metreveli reached the final in 1973 
                        -- the year of the player boycott -- but he was a Georgian 
                        representing the Soviet Union.<br>
                        After winning an ATP-leading seven titles in 2000, the 
                        21-year-old Safin has only a final showing at Dubai this 
                        season.</font></td>

                        Marat Safin, the fourth seeded Russian, defeated 
                        13th seed Arnaud Clement of France 6-0 6-3 6-2 to reach 
                        the Quarter-Finals for the first time. 
                      <br>
It was another convincing performance by Safin in only 
                          his third Wimbledon and he will now face Goran Ivanisevic 
                          in the last eight.<br>
Clement, in his first appearance in the 4th Round, 
                          showed real defiance in the last game when he saved 
                          three match points but on Safin's fourth chance the 
                          Frenchman put a forehand over the baseline.<br>
                        Safin served nine aces but only recorded 44 per cent of 
                        first serves in. On break points, Safin converted seven 
                        out of 11 while Clement missed the only chance that Safin 
                        allowed him.</font> </td>

                        Slowly but surely, Marat Safin is starting to believe 
                        in himself.<br>
                        The tempestuous Russian wrote off his chances almost as 
                        soon as he arrived at Wimbledon, but a five-set victory 
                        over David Prinosil on Friday has propelled the fourth 
                        seed into the fourth round. <br>
                        Safin should really have closed out the match in straight 
                        sets but the German rose to the challenge to keep his 
                        opponent waiting. <br>
                        &quot;I had a big opportunity when I was serving for the 
                        match and afterwards everything was against me,&quot; 
                        said Safin.<br>
                        &quot;He was making good shots and I couldn't do anything, 
                        but then I came back in the fifth set.&quot;<br>
                        Earlier this week, Safin had the air of a man who couldn't 
                        care less about the rest of this year after a season which 
                        has been wrecked by injury.<br>
                        But perhaps now he is starting to see light at the end 
                        of the tunnel, even though grass is far from his favourite 
                        surface.<br>
                        &quot;It's not my court because it's very difficult to 
                        play from the baseline, you have to play serve and volley,&quot; 
                        said the young Russian.<br>
                        &quot;I'm very surprised but happy. Maybe I can get my 
                        confidence here and maybe I can be dangerous here.&quot;<br>
                        Arnaud Clement, adept on all surfaces, lies in wait in 
                        the fourth round. Earlier this week, Safin would have 
                        dismissed his hopes of beating such a respected opponent, 
                        but he seems to give himself a chance.<br>
                        &quot;It's tough. He has a very good serve for a little 
                        guy, he is very fast and he has very good anticipation,&quot; 
                        admitted Safin.<br>
                        He added: &quot;I have to be careful with him - he is 
                        a fighter - but I have a chance to win. I hope I'll play 
                        better and if I have any chances I will try to take them.&quot;

                        Marat Safin was a relieved man after Canadian Daniel Nestor 
                        was forced to retire from their tense second-round encounter 
                        at Wimbledon on Wednesday.<br>
                        Nestor was leading 6-7, 6-3, 2-1 and seemed in the ascendancy 
                        against Safin, but injury wrecked his chance of springing 
                        a surprise and saved the fourth seed from a potential 
                        exit. <br>
                        Safin was grateful for his fortune afterwards. &quot;I 
                        think I played OK, but he was unbelievable in the second 
                        set. He was making volleys, drop shots, everything,&quot; 
                        he said. <br>
                        &quot;But I am satisfied. I'm happy that he retired - 
                        I couldn't do a thing against him but then he couldn't 
                        run to the net.&quot;<br>
                        After winning the US Open last season, Safin's fortunes 
                        - today excepted - have taken a nosedive.<br>
                        A nagging back injury still hasn't cleared up and the 
                        Russian hasn't won a title all season, but he revealed 
                        that the lure of a place in the prestigious season-ending 
                        Masters Cup will deny him a rest.<br>
                        &quot;The injury is starting to bother me a little bit. 
                        It's very difficult to recover completely, but I have 
                        to play to get to the Masters,&quot; admitted Safin.<br>
                        His compatriot Yevgeny Kafelnikov has advised Safin to 
                        take a complete rest and come back stronger next season.<br>
                        But the temperamental Russian, who nearly quit the game 
                        last season before a transformation in form, will not 
                        listen to anyone else.<br>
                        &quot;I know what I'm doing,&quot; he insisted.<br>
                        Nonetheless, Safin seems to be resigned to a disappointing 
                        season, even with the US Open title to defend.<br>
                        &quot;If I drop to No.20, it doesn't matter. But I will 
                        be back in the top 10 for some time. If not this year, 
                        then next year,&quot; he warned. </font> </td>

                        The US Open champion has been edging his way back to form 
                        and fitness after a debilitating back injury but Safin's 
                        self-belief is still conspicuous by its absence.<br>
                        &quot;I need some time to win some matches,&quot; he said. 
                        &quot;It's difficult to play without confidence. I'm far 
                        from my best but I will go slowly and try to regain my 
                        confidence.&quot;<br>
                        Even Nestor, a doubles specialist but hardly a fearsome 
                        force in singles, seems to worry the young Rssian.<br>
                        &quot;I don't think I'll be confident against Nestor,&quot; 
                        confessed Safin. &quot;He's a left-hander which isn't 
                        very nice.&quot;<br>
                        For now, the chances of Safin enjoying a quick fling, 
                        let alone a healthy relationship, with Wimbledon seem 
                        very remote.<br>
                        The fourth seed described the grass courts of SW19 as 
                        &quot;very, very bad, fast hardcourts&quot; and even criticised 
                        the balls.<br>
                        He claimed: &quot;The balls are a bit heavy - it's not 
                        nice to play with these balls. They are like stones.&quot;<br>
                        And Safin will certainly not be nipping down to the local 
                        bookmakers to back himself to emerge from Wimbledon with 
                        his second Grand Slam title.<br>
                        When asked what advice he would offer to gamblers, Safin 
                        urged: &quot;Don't do it. I don't want to be a betting 
                        guy in this situation, otherwise I would bet on myself!&quot;

                        new seeding system is unworkable and will flop, world 
                        No. 3 Marat Safin said Tuesday. <br>
                        Wimbledon organizers, along with the other three Grand 
                        Slam tournaments -- the Australian, French and U.S. opens, 
                        announced Monday they were to double the number of seeds 
                        from 16 to 32.<br>
                        The tournaments will seed the top 32-ranked players but 
                        also use surface expertise to decide the order of seeding.<br>
                        Wimbledon decided to implement the changes in order to 
                        stave off a threatened players' revolt.<br>
                        Claycourt specialists were upset that they were not being 
                        seeded according to their world rankings. It remains to 
                        be seen if the half-way measure will pacify them.<br>
                        But Safin said: &quot;This is not going to work.&quot;<br>
                        &quot;It is a mistake. It is just going to be a headache 
                        for everybody,'' he added after beating Jens Knippschild 
                        in a second round match at the Stella Artois ATP tournament.&quot;<br>
                        &quot;It is very simple. Just seed everybody according 
                        to their ranking. These are done over 12 months.&quot;<br>
                        NO DISCUSSIONS<br>
                        &quot;It has been like this for I don't know how many 
                        years.&quot;<br>
                        &quot;Make Wimbledon like everywhere else. No more discussions, 
                        nobody is upset. I think this would be the answer.&quot;<br>
                        &quot;I mean come on, OK, I won the U.S. Open last year. 
                        Does that mean I have to be number one seed?&quot;<br>
                        &quot;No way, say I won it last year and then didn't win 
                        for the rest of the year. If I am ranked 20 or 30 then 
                        I should be seeded 20 or 30.&quot;<br>
                        &quot;OK, they seed me one, I play on Center Court great. 
                        But nobody is going to come and watch me.&quot;<br>
                        &quot;It doesn't matter. Turn up and play. If you are 
                        good enough you will win.''<br>
                        Safin said that he doesn't think Pete Sampras -- Wimbledon 
                        champion for seven of the past eight years -- should be 
                        seeded one when the grass Grand Slam kicks off on June 
                        25.<br>
                        &quot;He is ranked four so he should be four. If he is 
                        good enough he will win an eighth title whether he is 
                        seeded one, four or whatever,'' Safin said. </font> </td>

                        U.S Open champion Marat Safin is throwing away his talent, 
                        his former coach Andrei Chesnokov said Wednesday.<br>
                        &quot;It would be a pity if Safin buried his talent into 
                        the ground,'' Chesnokov, who briefly coached Safin during 
                        last year's French Open, was quoted as saying in Sport-Express 
                        newspaper.<br>
                        &quot;If you take all the young talented players, Safin 
                        is the most talented among them without a doubt,'' said 
                        Chesnokov, who parted company with Safin for personal 
                        reasons 12 months ago.<br>
                        &quot;Although, I think he is just throwing all his talent 
                        away.''<br>
                        Safin won seven ATP titles last year and reached the world 
                        number one ranking shortly after beating Pete Sampras 
                        in the U.S Open final.<br>
                        But he has struggled this year and is yet to win a single 
                        tournament. He lost to Frenchman Fabrice Santoro in the 
                        third round of the French Open two weeks ago by committing 
                        a string of unforced errors.<br>
                        In the end, the 21-year-old Russian smashed his racquet 
                        in frustration after losing a point. He later refused 
                        to attend the post-match press conference, incurring a 
                        $10,000 fine from the organizers.<br>
                        &quot;Of course, you have to prepare yourself for a tournament 
                        like Roland Garros,'' Chesnokov, who reached the French 
                        Open semifinals in 1989 and now bases himself in France, 
                        said about Safin's defeat to Santoro.<br>
                        &quot;But even if nothing is working for you, you just 
                        can't wave your arms like a bird flaps its wings. You 
                        have to be a man on the court even if your game is off.<br>
                        &quot;I think if a player reached the number one ranking 
                        in the world and then drops to such a low, it's disappointing.'' 
                        Chesnokov's comments echoed those of Yevgeny Kafelnikov, 
                        who told Safin, his younger Davis Cup teammate, ``to grow 
                        up.''<br>
                        &quot;I respect Marat for what he accomplished last year 
                        but he has to grow up as a mature person because the attitude 
                        is not quite professional,'' the Olympic champion said 
                        during this year's French Open. </font> </td>
