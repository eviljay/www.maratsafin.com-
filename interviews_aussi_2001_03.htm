                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Ubaldo Scanagatta, La Nazione, Italia. Things seem 
                  to be getting much better, no. You're recovering from your injury 
                  completely or no?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>I said yesterday it wasn't an injury. It 
                  was a -- it could be very dangerous, but it's -- I mean, when 
                  you start to feel it, it doesn't -- is not the injury. It was 
                  I just decided not to force it too much because, I mean for 
                  the spectators last week, I was playing for them. And I can't 
                  play the match with my second serve. I mean, is not the point, 
                  you know, to go there and play and I mean I guess all these 
                  guys you can play with second serve. And I mean, also I wanted 
                  to take care of more of my elbow. But I mean it wasn't nothing 
                  dangerous, but it could be very bad.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> How now that the No. 1 is out, the No. 2 becomes No. 
                  1 in the seeding?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> But the tournament is not over yet. If, 
                  if, if I say all the time like this. First, it's Australian 
                  Open. Everybody wants to win here. This week we see who is No. 
                  1 and all these things. Because for the moment, is not the most 
                  important thing now. I think the most important thing for all 
                  the players, it's to win here. And then next week we see who 
                  is the No. 1, No. 2, because I mean it's the beginning of the 
                  year and everybody's -- everybody is not playing his best tennis 
                  because they had their vacations and all this stuff. So for 
                  the moment, everybody is trying to win here.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> How much of a distraction is the elbow?<br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: </b>I mean it's -- I said yesterday, if you coming 
                  here, you have to play 100 percent. One day I will get injured, 
                  I will stop. I will stop the match and I will go to treat, I 
                  will go to the hospital, whatever. But for the moment, I feel 
                  okay and I will play. I am playing and I am playing 100 percent. 
                  I am giving everything, especially with the serve. I mean for 
                  the moment it's working. For the moment, the elbow is okay.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> It's not something you think about during the match?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No, no, of course not. You can't think. 
                  You just play and you see. If you really can't serve, it's better 
                  to stop and say thank you.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q</b>. Georges Homsi, France. How close to your best level 
                  do you feel you're getting now?<br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think nobody's playing his best tennis now, 
                  this time of the year. I don't think that probably it's first 
                  round, and everybody is trying to get their confidence from 
                  last year. So we can talk about the level of the game after 
                  like in quarters, semifinal, it will be the best tennis. But 
                  for the moment, there's many matches, the serve doesn't work 
                  for some players. I mean, the baseline, many mistakes. But still, 
                  everybody's trying to find his best game and for the moment, 
                  you know, in the quarters we can say, &quot;Yeah, he's playing 
                  his best game,&quot; and all these things, but for the moment, 
                  there are people that are looking for it.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>Why just one month, it's enough to lose confidence 
                  with the tennis? I mean, okay, we talk about the beginning of 
                  the year. Actually you finish to play on the 10th of December 
                  or something like that.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, but you don't -- many people didn't 
                  play for three weeks. In three weeks --.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> You lose a lot.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> You lose a lot. You lose, of course, you 
                  have more kilos, you're getting fat. And of course, concentration 
                  is not the same already because you're not concentrated. And 
                  it's always tough to begin. It doesn't matter if it's two weeks, 
                  three weeks. After one week it's difficult already to play again 
                  and find your game. You must play two or three matches to find 
                  it. It's not -- it's quite easy to find, but sometimes it can 
                  be very complicated. But for the moment, yeah, I am trying and 
                  I am looking for my best game and for the moment it is working. 
                  Each is better and better.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>Do you agree with Kafelnikov when he says male tennis 
                  players aren't paid enough?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> (Laughing.) For me it would be great if 
                  they pay more. Much more. Why not? It would be great. But I 
                  mean I don't decide. I mean, the tournament directors and all 
                  this, they have to take care of these things. It would be great, 
                  yeah. I mean sometimes for some tournaments we can say -- I 
                  mean if you run here, 35 degrees, on the court it's 45, 40, 
                  it's tough. So they can pay you a little bit more.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> You agree with Kafelnikov --?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Yeah, completely. (Laughter.)<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> No, another subject arrived about Kafelnikov about 
                  you and how difficult it would be to repeat the same year last 
                  year because of inexperience, you're young, then on and on.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> We'll see. I mean, you don't have to think 
                  about defend points. It's kindergarten. We are professionals. 
                  So I try to win some more tournaments this year, and I mean 
                  for sure I will win a few tournaments. Maybe not seven; I will 
                  win, two, three. But I'm gonna go for every tournament and try 
                  to win them all and to be, I mean I think --.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q. </b>You don't think that --?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Why you cannot repeat? Yes, if you play 
                  well, why not?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> They always say that the second year is more difficult 
                  than the first.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Yeah, we'll see. I'm not losing many things. 
                  What am I gonna lose? I'm not losing anything.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Have you changed anything in the preparation for this 
                  year after the last year?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Preparation? We had no time for nothing. 
                  We had just -- I had preparation only for ten days. I mean it's 
                  not enough to play well during all the year. So that's why also 
                  the players that didn't come here like Corretja, Costa. Also 
                  a lot of players are talking with their physical coaches, which 
                  is very important, their physical condition. Because if you 
                  want to play in the best level during whole the year, you have 
                  to -- you have to work a little bit out of the court. And I 
                  want to do the same. I want to travel in Europe with my fitness 
                  coach and try to, you know, work hard to play my best tennis 
                  in the summer and in the autumn. Because now for the moment, 
                  I have enough energy, but is not enough for the summer and autumn.<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>Q.</b> Hrbaty, your quote on your next opponent?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, I mean I played against him two weeks 
                  ago and I beat him. But he was, I mean, different story. But 
                  I think will be very nice match and I'll try to win. I mean 
                  what can you say? It's gonna be tough, very tough. Because I 
                  mean he beat -- he's top 20. He beat very good players. He's 
                  playing probably -- he can play unbelievable tennis. But we'll 
                  see tomorrow, after tomorrow.<br>
