                    October 2001<br>
                    <br>
                    Ah! Marat it makes you wait two hours in the hall of his hotel 
                    in Lyon, then it merges in excuses and becomes a cream of 
                    man. The Russian connects the smiles, the answers and, when 
                    the question is not appropriate to him too much, it makes 
                    fun of himself, made laugh the interlocutor. The winner 2000 
                    of the Open of Paris Bercy, whose edition 2001 begins Monday, 
                    does not flame himself as much on the courts that last year, 
                    but it is always as adorable as unbearable. <br>
                    <br>
                    To come to dispute this tournament in Lyon, you drove from 
                    Valencia , in Spain. It is not the first time that you prefer 
                    to drive to go to a tournament....<br>
                    I do not make it as often as I would like it. That can be 
                    tiring. However, I like that much. I rent a car and there 
                    we are, that's simple.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What do you like in these long ways? </b><br>
                    I am quiet. I listen to music, I think about thousands of 
                    things. I cross also beautiful landscapes. It is very soothing. 
                    To tell the truth, it is one of the rare moments when I can 
                    really only find myself, without being disturbed. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Always had this passion of the road, of the cars? </b><br>
                    With cinq-six years, I was a large collector of small cars. 
                    You could not please me more than by offer me the part which 
                    was missing in my collection. In the street I had fun has 
                    to recognize the models. I was unbeatable. Today, unfortunately 
                    (he smiles), I do not have as many large cars the small ones 
                    of my childhood. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Which is your last acquisition?</b><br>
                    A Cherokee Jeep.... To buy cars, is my great pleasure. It 
                    is also my weak point, because it's expensive, too expensive.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Concerning your &quot; first &quot; passion, tennis, which 
                    memory did you keep of your victory in Bercy last year?</b><br>
                    I was on the wave of my victories started with US Open, not 
                    tired a moment, with an intact and indestructible confidence. 
                    I was winning everything, and it seemed to me like if it could 
                    not stop.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>You you felt invincible?</b> <br>
                    Completely. That's why, when I started to lose again, I did 
                    not understand. That's hard to realize, to analyze things 
                    when they should not happen.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Tiredness, lassitude, they took you by surprised or gradually? 
                    </b><br>
                    I do not know so much. Physically and technically, that was 
                    okay. But, in the head, at the very end of the season, I felt 
                    very tired. Then, it started to get wrong. Since the beginning 
                    of the year 2001, I connected the disappointments. I did not 
                    feel my shots, I was in a bad mood. I was cooked mentally 
                    and, when the head does not go, the legs do not follow. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>It is often said that, to succeed, there are sacrifices 
                    to make. In your case, I have the impression that there was 
                    a price to pay afterwards, kind of ransom of success? </b><br>
                    That is philosophy, a formula. What do you want me to answer 
                    to that... Before, that was not easy either. Take a look at 
                    the beginning of my year 2000. How many matches did I lose, 
                    how much 6-0 I boxed.... I was deeply depressed. That was 
                    not working. And that appeared completely unreal to me, because 
                    I knew what I was able. I saw those guys who won, garnered 
                    successes and I envied them. I was upset. It is not that they 
                    do not deserve their victories, but I had to be among them, 
                    naturally. Then, that changed, I proved my row.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>By feeling you invincible, while being flattered of any 
                    share, it was probably inevitable to take the large head a 
                    little?</b> <br>
                    I think that, despite everything what happen, I am a normal 
                    man. I still know where reality is. What occurs after a title, 
                    it is that you are very solicited and that you cannot satisfy 
                    everybody. Sometimes that can be pleasant. People, like you 
                    today, come to see me and want to discuss with me, to know 
                    what I think. It is flattering, that can be interesting. Perhaps 
                    will you make me reflect on myself (he smiles)! Ideas are 
                    exchanged.... I hope especially that it will be interesting 
                    for the one who will read it (he laughs).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Is this with saying that the victory isolate? players like 
                    you or Gustavo Kuerten,seems to close themselves more and 
                    more to other people.... </b><br>
                    With success, you suddenly have an incalculable number of 
                    new friends. Since my victory in the US Open, how much I had 
                    discussions with people whom I hardly attend, but which say 
                    to me that they know me perfectly and who know what I need, 
                    as trainer, as type of play.... That's generally this people 
                    I'm not listening. This people who are disappointed by me. 
                    I am it also by them. I believe that the guy is a friend, 
                    and comes to explain me the life during two hours. He feel 
                    suddenly invests of the responsibility of my career. On the 
                    other hand I'm still the same with my close circle of friends, 
                    of close relations, finally very restricted. And, I listen 
                    to them, I stay open to their opinions.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>You thus recognize, being a little less extrovert than 
                    before.... </b><br>
                    Admittedly. But it is also a question of moment. When all 
                    is going well, it is easier to go towards the others. I am 
                    not delighted by my season, and, during times like that, we 
                    are getting closed again a little bit, to centre on oneself, 
                    on what we are going through.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>You listen to the consulting of your friends, but do you 
                    follow them? </b><br>
                    Not always, it is true. But I have twenty one years old and 
                    I must sometimes try out my own errors, to find the errors 
                    by myself<br>
                    <br>
                    Precisely, one year ago, you were the won who won everything. 
                    Today it is not true anymore. Is this a sequence of circumstances 
                    or the fruit of your own errors? <br>
                    I have make errors undoubtedly this season, many and enormous 
                    (it makes great gestures then he keep silent lengthily).... 
                    How to know to prevent?.... I do not know, I do not control 
                    all. I have say it to you, it is necessary that I learn by 
                    myself, that I to live these things to understand what's happening 
                    to me and what I must avoid in the future.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Could you be more precise on your errors? </b><br>
                    Oh not! (It laughs). The list is well too long. It is not 
                    an hour, but three which this interview would last. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>That is to say. In any case, can you evoke of them the 
                    consequences, the difficult moments that you crossed? </b><br>
                    But some difficult moments I know only one of them, always 
                    in the same form: the defeat. We can't get used to it. Especially 
                    if you feel in good form. We are searching some solutions, 
                    the exit, but nothing works. After you have the impression 
                    to be in a black hole.... But over there (great gestures, 
                    mimicry, he makes the clown), there is a small flutter, which 
                    becomes brighter, is transformed into light (it tightens the 
                    arm) and you find the hope (he gets up, the tended arms).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>As at the time of the US Open this year, where you arrived 
                    in semifinal ? </b><br>
                    Yes, it is exactly that. Except that, very frankly, I can 
                    say to you that I would not have bet anything on me one week 
                    before the Tournament. It came like a beautiful surprise, 
                    a gift. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Since your wounds, are you more attentive with your body 
                    and changed some practices? I remember to have observed you 
                    last year, in Moscow, after the practice, you did not make 
                    more than three minutes of stretching, when you made some.... 
                    </b><br>
                    I get old. My body does not answer. Do you understand ? I 
                    spare myself.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>But, of course.... More seriously, which is your &quot;routine&quot; 
                    apart from the tournaments? You do not have the reputation 
                    to be a large hard worker.... </b><br>
                    O.K.! Seriously, My philosophy, it is that, in the life, it 
                    is necessary to do what you likes. My life, it is tennis. 
                    O.K.! It is also a business, a job. But me, I must be pleased 
                    to play, to practice. Because I know that then happiness will 
                    come to gain, that people will be happy for me, that it will 
                    be the festival as much for them than for me. That's how I 
                    work. Then I involve myself when it is needed. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>What does it mean? </b><br>
                    I play one hour with tennis and I do a little physical preparation. 
                    Once that it is finished, I go to the cinema, I drive car.... 
                    I do what I like. It's not typical but, with involving too 
                    much, playing too much, you kill the love of the play. It 
                    is necessary to arrive on the court with &quot;the desire&quot;, 
                    the free head. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>In connection with playing too much, one often says whom 
                    Yevgeny Kafelnikov gained only two tournaments of the Large 
                    Slam because it played too much to garner the premiums, it 
                    will be a characteristic of the Russian players. Yourself 
                    were criticized last spring because you play wounded for not 
                    louper your no-claims bonus.... </b><br>
                    I already largely.... Too much expressed myself on the reasons 
                    which has pushed me to do that. You want that I repeat the 
                    same thing. Not it is not worth it.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>You do not want to speak about money? </b><br>
                    Yes, of course, but on this precise point, I have say and 
                    repeat the same things.... The money is something very useful 
                    and interesting. And the relation you have with it depends 
                    on the past. It is enough to have missed some a little bit 
                    to want to catch up some every time you have the chance to 
                    get some. It is also a vicious circle which makes that, more 
                    you have some, more you want some. You should pay attention 
                    to do not create new need sall the time. It is not so simple 
                    (silence).... Now, relating to Yevgeny, I believe that it 
                    is his way of seeing the things, to see his career, his life 
                    of man, his life of player. That's belongs to him. Some other 
                    carry out different choices, even radically, like Sampras 
                    or Agassi.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>But, precisely, that went better for them.... Between the 
                    huge aspirations of Kafelnikov, and those more targeted of 
                    Sampras or Agassi, where are you located? </b><br>
                    I hope on the side of Agassi.... The future will say to us 
                    if I am wrong to think that.. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Let us speak technical: which compartment of the play are 
                    you practicing the most and how would you like to move? </b><br>
                    If I wanted to play like I dream, I would have to change everything. 
                    The plays which impress me it's those of Goran (Ivanisevic), 
                    of Krajicek, Larsson.... The attack is truly a beautiful attitude 
                    of play. You know, I do not have finally anything to see with 
                    what I wanted to become on a court. But the life had decided 
                    for me.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>However you give the impression of a very complete player, 
                    whose technical potential is enormous. It seems that with 
                    you the problem is rather mental.....</b><br>
                    Yes, but I believe that that concerns all the athletes. I 
                    repeat it to you: when the head is not fine, the body doesn't 
                    follow.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Is that the reason why you work with an ex winner of a 
                    Grand Slam tournament, who has proved what he can do?</b><br>
                    Yes. I changed my trainer to learn some new things. With Mats 
                    Wilander I work a lot on the concentration and the mental.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Does it include that only champions can understand the 
                    champions? </b><br>
                    To know what occurs in the head from an individual whatever 
                    it is, it is not easy. A champion, it is necessary even more 
                    complicated, because he crosses emotions, states - tops and 
                    low which are not shared unanimously. It is for that that 
                    somebody who passed through there will understand you better.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>We can't stop talking about head, I would like to know 
                    how is yours?</b><br>
                    Aie! (He laughs, then he wriggle in his armchair). You know, 
                    that can always go better. You do not believe, you also.... 
                    That one day that will be better? It is true that, we will 
                    not let make by the adversity!<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Do you follow the progress of your sister Dinara Safina? 
                    Do you try to advise her or on the contrary to not interfere 
                    you in her career in order to not disturb her?</b><br>
                    Oh! my sister, I know her situation by heart! But around her, 
                    there is a lot of people who think holding the truth on what 
                    she must do, and what she musn't. In fact, she feels a lot 
                    of pressure because she is my sister. I am not immodest, but 
                    if I were not the big brother, she would be a talented junior 
                    among others. Then, especially, but especially, I do not want 
                    to interfere me. I let her live. I believe that and even more 
                    at fifteen years, she must start to have some responsibilities, 
                    to make choices by herself. These moments would not have to 
                    be wasted.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>She has, obviously, a beginning of career very different 
                    from yours, since you were left on oneself. Would have you

                    <br>
                    I was not so unhappy. I was sent in Spain, because time in 
                    Moscow did not make it possible to be involved under good 
                    conditions all the year. Once in Spain it was not so terrible.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>But, while your mother is often with your sister, you were 
                    alone....</b> <br>
                    Yep. But I do not have too many moods. I was fourteen years 
                    old, people had not asked me so much my opinion and, even 
                    I would have given it, that would not have changed large thing. 
                    I did what people decided for me and it seams the good decisions 
                    were made, that has helped me to become what I am today.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>When you say &quot;people&quot;, it is your mother. It 
                    seems that she is the strong character of the family?</b> 
                    <br>
                    (Hilarious.) Really, you think ? What do I say you doubt? 
                    But of course, it is obvious! She decides on all, and it is 
                    insurmountable to explain to her why she could possibly be 
                    wrong. When she choosed to send to me in Spain, my father 
                    simply said to her: &quot;Yes, okay,like you want! &quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>You lived part of your adolescence in Spain before traveling 
                    much. Do you feel always Russian? Are you always in phase

                    I am Russian initially. It is what identifies me mainly. But 
                    I am not 100% Russian, because I want to keep opened eyes, 
                    I want to be aware on what's going on outside. Sometimes, 
                    I have the impression that there is a specifically Russian 
                    manner to think and I do not want to adhere to it. I do not 
                    want to reflect only through this prism. In this direction, 
                    I'm feeling sometimes shifted.<br>

                    <b>Apart from tennis, of the cars, what gives you the more

                    To sleep, I believe that I put to sleep in the first place.... 
                    That's on my nights that belongs my days. From where the dilemma 
                    (he smiles).... Because to have fun is also important! Let 
                    us say that, it's the reason why some days, &quot;you does 
                    not exist&quot;, you see? <br>

                    us say that some &quot;following days&quot;, you does not 
                    exist.... All the problem comes from the age, of the body. 
                    So that's important to take care. I know that I will never 
                    stop having fun, but I also know that, in ten, twenty, thirty 
                    years, it will be necessary that I sleep much more, that I 
                    will have to stop partying all the time, if I want to hold
