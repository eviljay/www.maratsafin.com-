                  Nick Imison<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  If you want to see Yevgeny Kafelnikov in action, you may need 
                  to be quick. The Russian No. 1 has promised to be true to his 
                  word and retire should his team achieve Davis Cup glory in December. 
                  Today Russia took another step towards that goal by winning 
                  a five-set doubles thriller against Sweden to achieve an unbeatable 
                  3-0 lead in their Davis Cup by BNP Paribas quarterfinal tie 
                  in Moscow.<br>
<br>
Russia is now set for its third successive home tie in September's 
                    semifinals, should Argentina complete its expected quarterfinal 
                    victory over Croatia. And being a superstitious bunch, there's 
                    every chance that the team will return to the Luzhniki Sports 
                    Palace, which has inspired them to memorable performances 
                    over the last two days.<br>
<br>
After overwhelming their opponents in Friday's singles rubbers, 
                    Yevgeny Kafelnikov and Marat Safin were today forced to dig 
                    deep to win their doubles contest against Jonas Bjorkman and 
                    Thomas Johansson 3-6 7-6 6-7 7-5 6-3. In Bjorkman they faced 
                    a four-time Grand Slam doubles champion, while Johansson possesses 
                    a big serve, and touch on the volley that are the envy of 
                    more seasoned doubles players.<br>
<br>
The opening set gave no indication of the three-and-a-half 
                    hour epic that would follow. A single break of Kafelnikov's 
                    serve in the fourth game was enough to give the Swedes the 
                    set 6-3 in 27 minutes. When Bjorkman and Johansson fought 
                    off an early 0-2 deficit down to build up a 4-2 lead in the 
                    second, it looked as though the players would be back in the 
                    locker room before most of the 10,000 spectators had unfurled 
                    their flags.<br>
<br>
But no-one had reckoned on the new-found resilience of the 
                    Russians, who managed to break the previously impregnable 
                    Johansson serve to level the set at 4-4, and the match went 
                    into a nerve-tingling tiebreak. Kafelnikov saved a set point 
                    at 5-6 with an ace, and two points later Johansson sent a 
                    volley wide to see the match tied at one set all.<br>
<br>
In the third set it was the Russians' turn to squander an 
                    early advantage. They built up at 3-1 lead, but a poor service 
                    game by Safin allowed the Swedes to level, and almost inevitably 
                    the match progressed towards another tiebreak. This time Bjorkman 
                    and Johansson made no mistake, taking the first two points 
                    of the breaker, which they went on to win 7-2.<br>
<br>
Break points were a rare commodity in the fourth set, with 
                    both partnerships enjoying just a single opportunity until 
                    Bjorkman came out to serve at 5-6. A netted volley by Johansson 
                    presented the Russians with set point, and a netted smash 
                    by Bjorkman off a desperate lob by Kafelnikov sent the crowd 
                    wild.<br>
<br>
Although the Swedes managed to stay with the home team throughout 
                    the early stages of the final set, the momentum had finally 
                    swung Russia's way. Johansson somehow managed to hold serve 
                    from 0-40 to level at 3-3, but two games later Bjorkman dropped 
                    his own delivery, leaving Kafelnikov to serve out for victory. 
                    The crowd was on its feet, perhaps realising that they could 
                    be taking part in an historic campaign.<br>
<br>
Afterwards a delighted Kafelnikov said that the Russian team 
                    planned to celebrate in style. &quot;There's an old Russian 
                    proverb. 'Once you've done your deed, relax and enjoy.' We 
                    were really motivated today and gave it one hundred percent. 
                    We knew that if we won the doubles, we wouldn't have to worry 
                    about the singles tomorrow.&quot;<br>
<br>
His sentiments were echoed by an exuberant Safin. &quot;The 
                    press have often criticised me for partying too much. Well 
                    tonight nobody can criticise me for going out. We really wanted 
                    to finish today and now can enjoy ourselves.&quot;<br>
<br>
A disappointed Johansson reflected: &quot;We had our chances, 
                    but didn't take them at the right time. We felt we were the 
                    better team for four sets, but they stepped it up really well 
                    in the fifth. Yevgeny returned well throughout the match and 
                    Marat came up with big shots when it mattered.&quot;<br>
<br>
Just how much partying is done will probably determine which 
                    players take to the court for Sunday's reverse singles. Both 
                    rubbers will now be the best of three sets.<br>
