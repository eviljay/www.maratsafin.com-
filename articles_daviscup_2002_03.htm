                  10, 2002, Olympic Stadium, Moscow, RUS, by Jo Sirman<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Marat Safin ended Swiss hopes in Moscow with a straight sets 
                  victory over Michel Kratochvil 61 76(6) 64, winning the fifth 
                  point for his country and putting Russia into the next round 
                  of the 2002 Davis Cup by BNP Paribas. It was the Australian 
                  Open runner-up's first Davis Cup singles victory in five matches 
                  and his third win in a decisive fifth rubber.<br>
<br>
The young Russian reflected on a weekend of fluctuating fortunes 
                    in which his country eventually got the right result. &quot;It's 
                    a team competition. Sometimes you play better, sometimes you 
                    play worse in Davis Cup... we were very nervous because it 
                    was a very important match... I didn't want to lose at home. 
                    I tried my best and in the end I was lucky.&quot;<br>
<br>
The hosts' happiness was tinged with relief following Kafelnikov's 
                    straight sets loss to Roger Federer in the fourth rubber. 
                    The Russian No. 1 was unable to explain his curious slump 
                    in the second and third sets. &quot;It's just unlucky circumstances. 
                    There was just a whole lot of circumstances that prevented 
                    me from playing well today.&quot;<br>
<br>
Russia will play Sweden in the quarterfinals, following their 
                    3-2 defeat of Great Britain in Birmingham, and has the luxury 
                    of another home tie. Captain Shamil Tarpischev confirmed that 
                    this would also be played in Moscow.<br>
<br>
Safin was dominant from the outset of the decisive rubber 
                    but Kratochvil, the older of the pair by nine months, never 
                    stopped fighting. The 22-year-old from Bern was one of last 
                    year's most improved players, and it was not hard to see why 
                    on Sunday in the Olympic Stadium. Kratochvil is reminiscent 
                    of Hewitt in style and pace, and with his frequent shouts 
                    of 'come on!' at crucial moments. <br>
<br>
The Swiss bench had little time to be euphoric following 
                    Federer's stunning win before Kratochvil had lost the first 
                    set and, it seemed, would slide to an early defeat. The opener 
                    lasted just 22 minutes and the Swiss was unable to get on 
                    the scoreboard until the sixth game, losing 61. <br>
<br>
Two forehand errors from Safin gave Kratochvil the first 
                    break in the second set, and he took a 4-1 lead to the sound 
                    of Swiss cheers and cowbells. At that point Kratochvil had 
                    another point to break, but a Becker-style lunge on a volley 
                    from Safin saved the point and the Russian held serve. Afterwards 
                    Kratochvil acknowledged that this was &quot;a key moment&quot; 
                    in the match. Instead of being two breaks up, he lost his 
                    own serve two game later, missing an easy smash to open the 
                    door to Safin. In an angry tenth game, where there were several 
                    disputed line calls, the Swiss player had further opportunities 
                    but it came down to a tense tiebreak. <br>
<br>
With Kafelnikov on his feet urging Safin on, the Russian 
                    No. 2 got to set point at 6-5, but double faulted to give 
                    Kratochvil a glimmer of hope. The moment quickly passed however 
                    as Safin won the next two points and the set, Kratochvil throwing 
                    his racket down in anger.<br>
<br>
Swiss resolve was not broken in the third set, and Kratochvil 
                    broke Safin in the third game, but victory for the hosts was 
                    within reach. The Russian clinched the vital break back with 
                    a blistering forehand return before breaking again two games 
                    later to seal the match and the tie 61 76(6) 64. The stadium 
                    erupted in cheers of delight tinged with relief, after three 
                    days of at times erratic but ultimately better tennis from 
                    their team. It had been close and they knew it.<br>
<br>
It was a hard loss for Kratochvil to take in his most important 
                    match to date in Davis Cup. &quot;I played a good match against 
                    Kafelnikov, I did my part for the team. Roger made two points 
                    and I absolutely wanted this one, but I wasn't hitting the 
                    ball as clean and hard as on Friday.&quot; Having improved 
                    so much recently, he is hopeful that Switzerland will come 
                    through in years to come. &quot;We are a good team and a very 
                    young team, so I think the future looks bright.&quot;<br>
<br>
Federer, who chose to play in Moscow in a red shirt to represent 
                    Swiss colours, agreed with his team mate that their country's 
                    time will come. &quot;For myself and my singles matches there 
                    was some great tennis from me this weekend. I couldn't have 
                    expected much more. I would have loved to win the doubles 
                    but they played very well... in the end it was just tough 
                    that we lost the tie.&quot;<br>
<br>
Switzerland must now play in the Davis Cup World Group Qualifying 
                    Round in September, which will determine if the nation continues 
                    to play in the World Group next year. The team will find out 
                    its opponent at the Draw, which takes place on 10 April.<br>
<br>
As the Russians celebrated, Kafelnikov already had one eye 
                    on the next round. &quot;Now I can't wait until we play 6-8 
                    April&quot;.<br>
