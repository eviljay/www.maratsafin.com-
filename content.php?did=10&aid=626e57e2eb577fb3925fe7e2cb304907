<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><STRONG>30 September 2006</STRONG></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><A href="javascript:ol('http://www.inside-tennis.net/index2.php?action=news&amp;amp;id=1969&amp;amp;ds=James Blake');"><U>http://www.inside-tennis.net/index2.php?action=news&amp;id=1969&amp;ds=James%20Blake</U></A></SPAN></FONT></P>
<P class=MsoNormal><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">James Blake will contest the final of the Thailand Open after beating Marat Safin 3-6 6-4 7-6(3) in 2 hours and 4 minutes of pulsating tennis. <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Although Blake had won their last encounter in Moscow last week in a dead rubber on clay, the Russian former world number 1 came into the match 2-1 up in their head to head record. <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Safin got off to the better start, bossing the American from the back of the court with his heavy groundstrokes, and making successful advances to the net to break Blake for a 3-1 lead. <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Blake missed 2 break point opportunities in Safin’s next service game, and then conceded the set after 25 minutes when he dropped his serve once more in the final game going long with his forehand. <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Safin was looking the more secure off the ground as the second set got under way and briefly threatened to take complete control of the match when he held break point in the 4th game. However, a backhand into the net snuffed out that opportunity and Blake went on to hold for parity at 2-2. <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">The next game proved to be pivotal as both men wrestled for control. From 15-40 down, Safin fought his way back to deuce with a forehand smash and an ace. After earning two game points, Safin had to fend off two further break points; the American prevailing on his 4th break point when the unseeded Russian went long on his forehand off a deep Blake return of serve. <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Safin earned himself a code violation as he smashed his racquet three times into shreds in complete disgust. Blake was back into the match, but had to save a break point when serving for the set at 5-4; he closed it out eventually on his 4th set point when Safin went marginally wide with a forehand drive. <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Safin achieved the first break opportunity on Blake’s opening service game of the final set, but blew his chance with a mishit forehand that ballooned into the stands. He did not waste his opportunities in Blake's next service game, creating 0-40 with some excellent return of serves, breaking when Blake went long on the forehand. <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Just when the Russian must have felt that he had wrestled control of the match, he found himself 0-40 down in the next game; he bravely fought off the first two, defending from the baseline like a terrier, but Blake got the break back on the 3rd when Safin’s backhand went long. <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Serving at 5-5, Safin found himself a break point down courtesy of a Blake running forehand crosscourt pass, and duly dropped serve going long on the forehand. <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Safin was not done yet though. As Blake served for the match, the mercurial Russian Davis Cup hero raised his game once more to earn himself a 15-40 lead. With an exquisite forehand volley drop shot, he forced a final set breaker to the delight of the partisan crowd who have come to adore the Russian, good or bad. <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Blake soon silenced the crowd; storming into a 4-0 lead with some solid play, he held 5 match points at 6-1 before closing it out 7-3 with a service winner. <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">“The two games I tried to serve it out in the 2nd and 3rd set I felt like he was back to the player that beat (Roger) Federer in Australia a couple of years ago. He made it seem like you’re at his mercy”, Blake said. <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">“He played great those two games and I just tried to weather the storm. I felt like I had more matches than him this year. It’s tough for him coming back from his injury.” <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Blake felt that he could relate to Safin’s frustration at losing matches when in a winning position after suffering the same fate when coming back from his injury plagued year of 2004: <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">“It won’t take him as long to come back; he’s got so much talent, so much game. Before he knows it he’ll be back in the winners circle again”, Blake promised. <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Blake will now face Ivan Ljubicic in the final after the top seeded Croat beat local Thai favourite Paradorn Srichaphan in straight sets: <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">“I’ve never beaten Ljubicic. Played him three times, the last two were very close, but it seems like he out serves me every time. If I can get a look at some serves, some 2nd serves, I’ll take my chances on those and you never know. He’s an excellent player, number 3 in the world.” <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Safin’s disappointment at losing a match that he could so easily have won was plain for all to see and hear. However, he was cheered by the news of Blake’s compliment that he felt the Russian was playing like a Top 10 player: <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">“Really? Yeah…If he says so then I guess he knows better. He’s in the top 10 so he should know better as I’m pretty far out”, Safin said. <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">“But I had my chances; I’ve lost a lot of matches this year where I was leading like today that slipped away. If I had won half the matches that I should have won then I would already be in the top 10.” <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Safin’s depressing summary of his year got even darker: <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">“This year has been a disaster in many ways. I’ve had to deal with a lot of problems inside and outside of the court. My ranking is coming up slowly so I’m trying to finish this year on a good note and then forget about this year.” <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">“I don’t have expectations for this year. I don’t believe that something will turn around and just click to create a new story; I don’t expect that. There has been a lot of miscommunication, a lot of misunderstanding, something missing. A lot of problems; I don’t feel like luck is on my side. It’s tough.” <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">So does that mean Marat that you will not work with Peter Lundgren again this year? <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">“I don’t know.” <BR><BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">ANDRE JONES <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN lang=EN-GB style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Impact Stadium <BR></SPAN></FONT><FONT face=Arial size=2><SPAN style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Bangkok </SPAN></FONT></P>
