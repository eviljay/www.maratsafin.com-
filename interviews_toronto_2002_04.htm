                  Marat Safin - Guillermo Canas (ARG) 5-7, 3-6.<br>
                  AN INTERVIEW WITH: MARAT SAFIN</b><br>
                  <br>
                  TOUR OFFICIAL: Any questions for Marat? <br>
<br>
REPORTER: Marat, where did you lose it?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: A tough question. I think he played great tennis 
                    and I just -- I just was missing my opportunities all over 
                    the court. I had so many opportunities and it's so -- I cannot 
                    explain how frustrated I am right now, you know, with -- I 
                    had everything -- everything and I lose -- I lose all my opportunities. 
                    I lost everything, what I had and I lost so many chances in 
                    this match so I just -- it makes me feel so pissed that I 
                    cannot describe it.<br>
<br>
REPORTER: Marat, did you underestimate him a little bit? 
                    Did you underestimate him just a little bit?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No definitely not because, you know, that he 
                    is a great player. He is in the top 20 so anyway you have 
                    to respect the guy and, you know, that he gonna play great 
                    tennis even, you know, -- he's a big fighter and I knew that 
                    he gonna run all over the court. I knew that he gonna give 
                    everything and -- but just -- I cannot explain you why -- 
                    why and what reason -- what was the reason that I lost this 
                    match. I was playing -- I was trying -- I had my chances but 
                    the chances when I had my chance to just to do something, 
                    I didn't do anything. I was waiting for a mistake. My backhand 
                    was terrible today. I had so many chances with my backhand 
                    and I was just missing or just -- just out or just on the 
                    net and I was -- I couldn't finish the volleys that I had 
                    to finish and I had to finish and I had to take my chances 
                    with the ball is just -- I had to go for it some times and 
                    I didn't go and I was waiting for the mistake and I was trying 
                    to play very smart technical tennis which is not my game and it's just -- I just had it there 
                    but I couldn't take it. I was so close to win this match. 
                    It could go actually other way around. It could go 7-5, 6-3 
                    but then it's -- when he won the first set and then I just 
                    -- I felt like I'm losing it, and I'm losing it -- train is 
                    running away -- and I cannot -- I cannot jump on it and it 
                    just -- I felt this way. <br>
Even the second set I had my chances but just -- I missed 
                    everything. <br>
<br>
REPORTER: Did you know that he pulled out of the doubles 
                    yesterday with a wrist problem and did that influence your 
                    thinking?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Come on! He can't but you can see that he is 
                    playing well. He is playing -- he's very confident and he's 
                    playing great tennis and I don't think it's -- maybe it's 
                    hurt -- the wrist is hurting but just - he, he wanted to make 
                    sure to play singles -- to be able to play singles. That's 
                    why he retired from doubles. I think that was the reason. 
              <br>
<br>
REPORTER: Marat, for the second straight day you have played 
                    a very cautious match where you were waiting for your opponent 
                    to make a mistake. Do you think you lost your confidence a 
                    bit? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Maybe. I think so. Yeah. I think so because 
                    I'm not going -- I'm not going for the shots that I used to 
                    go. I used to be more, you know, more aggressive and not wait for the mistakes. I used to play my -- I used 
                    to build the point and now I'm playing a little bit defensive 
                    tennis. I'm playing with Canas -- I'm playing three (Ph) metres 
                    behind the baseline, and it's not my game, so it's difficult 
                    to beat Canas playing his game, and he was attacking the ball 
                    all the time. He was running for -- he was hitting the ball 
                    from the forehand all, all the time. He was serving well, 
                    he was returning, and I give him all the confidence that I 
                    had to him and I was just trying -- I was -- I was just trying 
                    to stay there and trust just going to wait for his mistakes. 
                    Even knowing this in the match I couldn't change it. It's 
                    like -- it's so pathetic and it's -- I'm just like I'm laughing 
                    at myself that how, how bad I could build the match, how bad 
                    I could build it tactically and just being so -- you know, 
                    to not have been enough balls to win this match. That's -- 
                    that's how I'm feeling. I'm just describing you and it's -- 
                    I'm not, I'm not scared of telling this. It's just -- I'm 
                    feeling this way. <br>
<br>
REPORTER: Marat, was there anything he did that surprised 
                    you or anything in particular that was -- that made it difficult 
                    for you?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Oh, he was playing solid game. He was serving 
                    well. He was -- he played some great tennis and great forehand. 
                    Very good forehand. He was doing a lot with opening the court. 
                    He went to the net when he had to go. Good backhand. He's 
                    pretty solid player and I respect him but just to beat this 
                    kind of player you have to do something. <br>
<br>
REPORTER: Marat, there's a lot of tennis to be played in 
                    the next seven weeks but you will play him again at the Davis 
                    Cup semifinal. He has now beaten you in the ... (Inaudible) 
                    ... Successive days. Do you think there is any significance 
                    in that for the match in Russia?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No, it has nothing to do. Davis Cup is a, is 
                    a different story. It is just different -- different type 
                    of game. It's -- and also it's -- it's completely different. 
                    You cannot compare a ATP win to the Davis Cup. It has nothing 
                    to do. It has nothing to do. <br>
<br>
REPORTER: Marat, when did you start losing your confidence? 
                    A long time ago? Do you know why and when? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I don't know why and I know for sure that was 
                    like starting in Hamburg -- Hamburg finals because I was playing 
                    great tennis against Hewitt. Was one of my best matches ever. 
                    I was playing great and I was playing like in 2000 -- back 
                    in 2000 I felt it was 3-3, 6-1, and he had no chances at all, 
                    and then after the final -- I played the finals against Federer 
                    -- Roger Federer -- I start to understand it -- I am not good 
                    enough and I'm not good enough to beat all this players. Even 
                    I made the quarter semifinals of ... (Inaudible) ... But I 
                    was struggling. Every match I was struggling. I was against 
                    ... (Inaudible) ... I went four sets. It was not his best 
                    surface. It was rocket five sets and just was terrible match 
                    against Ferrero, and then it's like Schhhhhhhhhewwww (Ph). 
                    Dropping, dropping, dropping. <br>
<br>
REPORTER: Marat, are you thinking of retiring? You might 
                    stop playing tennis now?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No, no, no. I have to find -- I have to look 
                    for solutions. I have to -- I have to look for them really 
                    quickly and I have to do something because otherwise I will 
                    -- I will definitely go crazy if I move on like this. If I 
                    will -- because I can play two matches. I can play great but 
                    then there is no consistency which is I'm looking for, for 
                    like and if you -- if you want to be a great player you have 
                    to be consistent which is Hewitt. I think he is a great player. 
                    He is pretty consistent. That's why he is No. 1 in the world. 
                    And I can play a couple of my good matches but then it's just 
                    -- you have a match that you just -- you don't know what's 
                    going on and it's -- it's -- that's why it's -- I have to 
                    look for something and look for a solutions because I cannot 
                    move on like this otherwise I will definitely go crazy. A 
                    couple of more matches like this and it's going to be disaster. 
                 <br>
<br>
                    REPORTER: Are you worried at all now that your sister might 
                    give you a hard time 'cause she won?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No not yet. Not yet. She still respects me. 
                 <br>
<br>
TOUR OFFICIAL: Anything else for Marat? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No. <br>
<br>
REPORTER: I am trying to understand. It's more your physical 
                    tiredness or it's more mental tiredness or what, what is combined 
                    with the question of the retirement? So you feel your tired 
                    or not ready to the real game? So what you're feeling? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Definitely cannot be fitness. I think he was 
                    referring the mental part. Right? Yeah. You know. Everybody 
                    knows it. (Laughter). So it was like that -- everybody knows 
                    which is my problem. I think it's mental and it's some times 
                    difficult for me to find the motivation but, but now I'm okay. 
                    I have my vacations. I'm coming back and I just had this -- 
                    I hope I will not have any more matches like this and I hope 
                    I can -- I have to work on it and I have to find the solutions 
                    and I have to be more consistent if I want to fight for No. 
                    1 which is now is getting tougher and tougher because he's 
                    going to be tough because Hewitt -- he gonna be way tough 
                    in Cincinnati and he will be okay I think in -- and I think 
                    it's -- it's gonna be New York will decide who's just -- if 
                    I will have a chance or not and Haas is playing great tennis 
                    right now and there are other guy -- a couple of guys that are not far behind. <br>
<br>
TOUR OFFICIAL: All right. <br>
<br>
REPORTER: What can be the solution to get back your confidence? 
                    A real coach? Or did you think about that? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Like everything together. I have to look for 
                    something because just I have no -- I don't have the game 
                    there. The game is not there. The game is not there. I'm just 
                    playing more defensive. I'm not attacking anymore. I'm not 
                    building the point. I am not putting the pressure on the other 
                    guy and I'm just sit back and wait for the mistakes of other. 
             <br>
<br>
I have to change somehow. I don't know how. If I had the 
                    solution I would not be sitting here. I would be happy and 
                    I would be winner, and I would be in the semifinals, but now 
                    I'm finding myself in a little bit tough situation because 
                    I can see that -- I have win a great couple of matches before 
                    like just two days ago. Like today makes me feel a little 
                    bit worse. Just I felt like no confidence. No confidence. 
                    I have no confidence. <br>
<br>
