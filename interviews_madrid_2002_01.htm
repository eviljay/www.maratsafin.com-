                  An interview with: MARAT SAFIN</b><br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  MODERATOR: Questions for Marat in English or Spanish. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Can you talk about the match. <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I had chances in the first set. In the second one, 
                  I was 5-4 in the tiebreak. It went to 5-4. He played an incredible 
                  ace there. He played a very good volley. One ace and one volley, 
                  those two points, I was overwhelmed by those two points, especially 
                  coming from him, because he doesn't have such a good volley. 
                  <br>
                  The match was taken away from me. It's quite hard for me to 
                  take this defeat. Also the surface is a bit strange. I can't 
                  figure out how the ball bounces. I played quite flat, and this 
                  ball flies up a lot. <br>
                  In the second set, I really think I played better than him, 
                  but he had those two shots that were decisive. If we had gone 
                  to a third set, I think I would have been able to have won the 
                  match, but it's too late now.<br>
                  In the last weeks, I've been playing quite well. It's a pity 
                  I had to face Calleri in the first round. It was unfortunate 
                  for me. Although, in the second set, I should have won that 
                  second set. The third set would have come easier. Didn't give 
                  me the chance to go to a third. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. What do you think about your position for the Masters Cup? 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Well, we are all very tight. It all depends on 
                  the last tournaments. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Do you really want to go to Shanghai? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Well, of course I would like it. Well, if you go 
                  to Shanghai, you would also like to win Shanghai. It's not only 
                  the fact of going to Shanghai or earning money because you are 
                  there. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. You've been all over the globe. Week after week must take 
                  its toll on you. <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: It's every time, it's getting more difficult. Every 
                  week there is more deceptions, you know. First of all, I think 
                  it starts with Hong Kong. I arrive, I was completely dead on 
                  the court in the second round. I was dizzy, I had no more energy. 
                  I flew back to Moscow. I had a few days to recover. <br>
                  Then I lost in semifinals to Mathieu, which was a nice match, 
                  but still the way I was playing, I should have won, because 
                  I was playing at home. Everything was set perfectly to win this 
                  tournament. <br>
                  Then I had the tournament in Lyon, lost in the quarterfinals 
                  to Kuerten 7-6 in the third. Today I lost 7-6, 7-6. So I'm losing 
                  already three tiebreaks in a row. It's getting on my nerves. 
                  I'm disappointed, you know, because I'm very close to Shanghai. 
                  I'm playing much better. I'm trying to do well. But unfortunately, 
                  luck is not on my side right now. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Is it possible to have a week where you don't play and recharge 
                  your batteries?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Now I have a few days off, but I have only two 
                  tournaments left this year, and I will have to do well if I 
                  want to get into Shanghai. But I'm not sure because everybody's 
                  playing well. <br>
                  Ferrero, he won this match today, he's just right behind me. 
                  Henman, it's going to be tough. Now I'm basically out in the 
                  first round. They're going to get closer and closer, even pass 
                  me. Not so many chances to get there.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. In the end, Davis Cup is bound to catch up with you, you 
                  had a tremendous performance there. <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, Davis Cup, I mean, but it was a long time 
                  ago. I had enough time to recover. I've been playing great for 
                  the last few weeks. Just I think is not more physical, is not 
                  more mental, it's just something, two points, it's luck. <br>
                  I need to start to win in tiebreaks. I'm not having them. I 
                  have to wait and I have to wait and I have to wait until it 
                  will come. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. The match was so close. What do you think made the difference 
                  between you two? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I told you before, there was these two points that 
                  made the difference. I knew that the match was going to be hard 
                  because I lost against him some years ago in Kitzbuhel, and 
                  I know how he plays. I know he hits the ball hard. He's a brave 
                  player. He serves well. <br>
                  Anyway, if I had won the second set, or even the first one when 
                  I was 4-1 up -- and also in the tiebreak I was 5-4, there were 
                  several times where I should have turned it around. <br>
                  It's a question of luck. But, well, what can I do? We could 
                  speak about the match for a long time, but I lost. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. You hit really risky shots. <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, it's true, I took risks. I played some great 
                  points. But what can I do now? <br>
                  <br>
