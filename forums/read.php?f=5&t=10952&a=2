         <br>
      ROGER_FEDERER : <br />
He is versatile with wide range of shots and has excellenece in every domain and aspect of the game and hence he is Number One.Amazing single handed backhand ,powerful forehand, Fine sense of angle ,Beautiful placement, Adequate speed(I think there is some scope of improvement in this field)His speed still isn't as fast as Coria or Nadal,Its his accuracy of shots and the power attached with it that makes him so invincible in fast grass court but still his speed is adequate enough just perfect and balanced.Has tremendous ability to accelerate or deaccelerate the pace of the game,I have always compared him with fast car with many gears which he keeps on adjusting according to the quality of opponent in question.Can raise the level of the game triple fold and can play at his own pace.Total domination and likes to dictate terms in court.Defence probably the best in ATP.Undoubtly an amalgamation of talent and truly deserving Number-One.<br />
<br />
************************************************<br />
<br />
MARAT_SAFIN : <br />
The extremelly talented Big Russian with Serve among the best but here lies the difference between him and Roddick,His game is not based only on his serve but his all round game.Tremendous balance, good mobility fast reach and quick reflex makes him a naturally dangerous player.Like Roger he has loads of weapons but his mental inconsistency sometimes acts as a barrior for effective use of those weapons.His jumping backhand not only classy and a treat to watch but effective to maximum extent ,among best of all time.Technical error probably Null but the only problem inconsistency and his temper(Quite balanced and composed presently),If he can play with calm,composed and poised attitude ,He can be the most dangerous player of all because his potential was never doubted by anyone.Unpredictable ,Can win a grandslam and as well as face an early round exit.hard and risky to bet on but certainly tournaments are incomplete without his presence and undoubtly Roger's favourite opponent.His Charisma in court is mind blowing.<br />
************************************************<br />
ANDY_RODDICK : <br />
too much power and less class,has a lot of potential but yet to implement perfectly and flawlessly.Relies a lot on his serve and game tailormade for grass but not at all at par with Roger Federer.Tries to try new things but commits lots of error.Powerful shots but without adequate placement and hence made ineffective by better players like Roger and Hewitt.In Clay his game falls apart and the name Andy Roddick doesn't sounds intimidating at all.<br />
************************************************<br />
<br />
LLEYTON_HEWITT : <br />
perhaps the hard working and most serious Tennis Player of all,truly deserving Number Two player.Not a very good serve but has improved a lot.Mind and fighting spirit perhaps next to none ,has the capability to face multiple matchpoints but still win in the end.Fighting spirit and never say die attitude raises his average(Above can be said)Tennis potential to a high level and his fighting spirit is really rewarding and helps him to win.Disciplined and hardworking player.Has amazing placement but not as good as Roger.brilliant court coverage and perhaps energy and speed more than Roger but lacks articulate class and his double handed backhand is not as efficient infact not even half as effective as Roger.very predictable Tennis player but certainly deserving number two.His game is boring to watch but a player worth betting for If not playing against Roger,Certainly he is much better than big serving Roddick.<br />
<br />
*************************************************<br />
<br />
RAFAEL_NADAL : <br />
the young rising talent but game too customized and tailormade for Clay.Is very ineffective in fast grass court and fast US Open court,Simply adores slow Roland garros clay court and has established himself as king of clay court.A player whose topspin and deep baseline reaching shots is his major power and his left handed angle is very effective.Perhaps fastest and most energetic of all at this moment and In terms of speed and mobility he is way ahead of Roger.Game splits apart in grass and hard court and he will surely earn 6-7 grand slam in his career (French Open most of it)With maturity most probably will win 1-2 Aus Open as the bit slow hard cpurt of AUS Open will be easy to adjust to for him.Game is percentage game.<br />
<br />
************************************************<br />
<br />
ANDRE_AGASSI : <br />
What more can be said about this evergreen player who is a living example of how fit a 35 year old man can be.At this moment can be easily without doubt termed as the Number One American Player.Has the capability and game to beat anyone in Top ten but except Roger federer.Doesn't Approaches net at all and sometimes that becomes his major weakness and constraint.Serve not so big and fast but consistent and can keep the effectiveness On when it really Matters.Has won clay title as well as fast court titles as well,has seen his career like a rollercoaster ride in his life time and has fought back and established himself.Predictable game but effective and strong and implementation perfect.Could have won many more grand slams If Pete was not so dominating ,reminds me of Ken Roswell who was too good but people remember Rod Laver more.A person who is ideal to Idolize.<br />
<br />
*************************************************<br />
IVAN- LJUBICIC :<br />
Never ever his potentials were questioned and his talent understated,He is capable of achieving the best and fight with equal terms with Roger Federer,If ofcourse his court game is upto his mark.man with powerful Serve but when it doesn't works ,he seems to struggle to hold his game together and his confidence.His baseline game has improved a lot since he played in Greece Olympics.He is another player gifted with single handed BackHand and hence the positive strings attached with having one handed backhand.His groundstrokes might not be as powerful as Marat Safin but effectiveness cannot be questioned.He is calm poised but seems to suffer from lack of confidence and self believe in bigger tournaments and when fighting against best in big arena.he likes to construct his game but when opponent presses hard he loses the rhythm and falls pray to his opponent's strategy and domination.In one sentence "his capabilities are still unutilized".<br />
************************************************<br />
FUTURE_PROSPECT : <br />
,According to me RICHARD GASQUET ,has got the game and potential to rule Tennis world but depends on how much he improves and matures.Backhand as effective as Roger,Very quick reflex, nice anticipation and placement extremelly effective . How much he progresses remains to be seen.<br />
