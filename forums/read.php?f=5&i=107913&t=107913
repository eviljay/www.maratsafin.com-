At 19 a person has to make their own mistakes, hurt themselves, otherwise you cannot become strong. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
Even going up the stairs I have to be extremely careful. It's cold today, and my knee hurts. This is a permanent injury. I will never be able to completely get rid of it. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
Even though I had been warned that I had to get treatment for another 2-3 weeks, I got on court and finished myself off. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
Even when we were winning over French in the Davis Cup final, the French applauded me, can you believe it? <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
Federer became more disciplined, serious, a real Swiss. I have wonderful memories about Sampras-he treated me really well and I respected him deeply, just as I respect Agassi. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
I am already 25 and not 18, when I could have gone out to play after a party and treated tennis differently. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
I am in this business, but I want to be healthy, and I don't want my colleagues to receive numerous injuries in one year. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
I am not a gambler at all. I don't fancy poker or any other card games. I also have no patience, so golf is out of the question. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
I cannot abuse something which is the basis of my lifestyle. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
I cannot lie around on the sofa watching TV. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
I cannot stand boorishness. I try to stay calm. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
I cannot stand the word celebrity and anything it might imply. It's total nonsense. When someone calls a person a celebrity, it's like they are trying to turn him into a robot. I am a human being. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
I definitely couldn't have reached my present level if I continued with football. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
I don't like Wimbledon. And US OPEN only for New York. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
I had a chance to meet presidents-Vladimir Putin, George Bush Sr., Bill Clinton, and directors, musicians. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
I have been meaning to come to my historical motherland for a very long time now. I have never been here before and am ashamed of it. I feel very welcomed in Kazan. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
I have only gained two kilos since I stopped playing. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
I live for myself. I don't care what's being said behind my back. If I think I can afford to do something, I do it. I don't need other people's judgements. I decide it for myself. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
I make mistakes sometimes, but on the whole I am becoming an expert. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
I play tennis not only because it pays good money but because I enjoy it. The more I like it, the better I play. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
I played injured for six months. I played Roland Garros after painkilling injections of up to 1400/1600 milligrams. It helped at the time but it was impossible not to limp after a match. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
I trained in Spain, where they don't really pay perfection too much attention. Due to my height I am limited in movement on court. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
I was number 1 for 12 weeks. I only left that spot when I had torn a ligament. You get this feeling of reaching a ceiling. When you're a bit lower you have something to aim at. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
If I have the opportunity to become No. 1 in the world, I would love to achieve it. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
If the first Russian President never played tennis, it would have been just a casual sport. But nowadays people know so much about it. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
In Athens, there was barbed wire all around the village. I had the Israeli team as neighbours. People with machine guns used to guard them. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
In football, one can hide himself, but on court a person is fully exposable. Tennis is a personality questionnaire. On court some secret features of a character start appearing. You can't hide anything. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
In tennis, one thing leads to another, it's like a circle, which you cannot get out from. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
In the 1990s our tennis was totally hopeless. No racquets, no balls, no tournaments. It was impossible to break through staying in Russia. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
It is rather difficult for me to play in Moscow. But Russian supporters like me more than the Brits like Henman, who has been hated in London because he cannot win Wimbledon. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
It is very hard for me to switch from clay to grass. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
Knowing what kind of money I earn, people tend to think I party every night and don't give a damn about tennis. This point of view is stupid. It is also an insult to me. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
Life is great and it's really stupid to waste time. You'll regret aimlessly wasted years. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
Marcelo Rios, he stopped taking the business seriously and had to leave. If I treated tennis in the same manner I would not be around. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
My goal is to pick up good form for the Australian Open, where I have a lot of ranking points to defend. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
My Grandpa still doesn't speak Russian very well but he said everything with his actions. I don't think I would have become what I am right now if it wasn't for him. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
New York is a fantastic city. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
Not even a well-trained person can handle this pressure. That's why by 30, most players retire. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
Now, when I can buy anything I want, my passion for chic clothes has vanished. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
Our female tennis boom is because of Kournikova. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
Satisfaction, results and money go together as a whole. That is why the times of uncertainty, I cannot call them good times. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
Ten years ago you could reach a final of a serious tournament with just your serve. Now everyone has impeccable preparation. You have come to a bodybuilding contest! <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
Tennis balls change every time. Can you imagine football players having to play with balls of different weight all the time? <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
Tennis dictates a lifestyle which you can't lead staying in one place. I cannot imagine being in the same city for over three months. I have to keep moving, otherwise it feels like I am missing something. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
Tennis has become such an individual sport that no one is really friends with anyone. We all have our own lives. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
Tennis is my life and my business. All that I have, I owe it to tennis. I treat my business the same way as a chairman of the bank treats his. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
The food is horrible-fish and chips and hamburgers. How can you give such a treatment to people? Wimbledon's profit is around 60 milliom pounds! <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
The worst thing for a man is when there is nothing to do and no future. A man starts to degrade. I love life. I constantly need to do something. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
There is a huge difference between getting treatment in Moscow and in an unknown city. I wanted to howl I was so sick at heart. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
To quit everything you've lived for, for 15 years and try to do something new is very hard. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
Two Grand Slams, it's already something. One Grand Slam, you can win by mistake. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
We play non-stop 11 months a year. We have one month to rest and get ready for the next season. How can we talk about health, rest and personal life? You cannot take a two-week break if you are tired. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
What is going to happen to the guys coming after us is a mystery. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
What to do after a career? I ask advice from my closest friends. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
When I put on a track suit with Russia written on it, everyone looked at me with respect. I lost on the very first day but stayed until the end of the Olympics. Tons of fun! <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
When I was 17 I had one pair of trousers and one pair of shoes for every occasion. I remember coming to Davis Cup for the first time-no suit, no white shirt. I look at the photos and feel ashamed. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
You can find flaws in Agassi and Sampras, but Federer has none. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
You have to play while you can, you cannot escape from it. <br />
Marat Safin <br />
<br />
You won't get far with just talent nowadays! <br />
Marat Safin <br />
