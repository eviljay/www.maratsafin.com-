      Hello everyone!<br />
<br />
Thanks for replying to my earlier messages about how you all became fans of Marat...<br />
<br />
I just want to say that I am so amazed on how everyone here cares sooo much about him... if you stop to think just a little bit about that fact... I am sure that all of us, being so far away from each other, felt the exact same way about what happened today. I think that is very remarkable. <br />
<br />
But it also made me wonder on what is our role as "fans"? It seems there´s a little confusion there. For some, being a good fan means being ever-positive, ever-hoping and puting on a smile no matter what. For others, it means trying to "keep it real" and pointing out when things don´t go very well, looking for an explanation.<br />
<br />
I think this may be a very personal choice, and whatever the side you should choose, it´s okay at the end of the day as long as you are respectful to others and remember... we are just fans. <br />
<br />
About the collective outcry of frustration, well we all have our moments, and for some reson sharing it with others in a media like this can be comforting... but the outcry has to be resolved... has to lead to better things. To reaffirming hope, to a positive feeling. Otherwise, is just making a thunderstorm in a glass of water.<br />
<br />
Finally, my own thoughts about the game... well, I came to the conclusion that no one knows or will know Marat´s game better than himself. It´s not like he´s a youngster who doesn´t know what he´s doing. I don´t think he needs advice, or criticism. I really think he, and the people around him, try their best to have an all-around strategy to help him get closer to his goals. Sometimes strategies don´t work so you have to plan another one. But it´s not, by any means, like breaking a promise (or because he said something earlier...). I feel like some of you feel dissapointed because you think he´s not doing enough according to a certain expectation. But whose expectations are those? his? or yours?<br />
<br />
Stop to think about it... how would you feel if you where in his shoes. You are fighting to reach your professional goals, and you´ve been doing a job you love for so long, that those goals are not only professional but your life´s dreams. <br />
<br />
And then you have all these people around that say that either you would have to be doing something different if you want to get to those goals... or that there´s something wrong with you that won´t allow you to get to those goals... and sometimes the people treat you like the best, and other times they treat you like you are the worse. Uff! Can you imagine that? How would you feel about having all these outside pressures on your struggle?<br />
Your very own and personal struggle?<br />
Don´t tell me you wouldn´t give a damn about what others say and go on, because that is a very hard thing to do, you would have to be like a robot...<br />
<br />
I think our role as fans is to be positive. It doesn´t mean that we don´t want better things for him, or that we are blind to rough patches.<br />
It means that from all these outside noises, fans are the ones who stick through thick and thin. Who wouldn´t want to have someone positive to pick you up?<br />
<br />
But it has to be unconditional. No one forces you to be a fan or not. Just like a good friend doesn´t need you to give especific reasons to be with you. In a very unique way, we are friends of the "outside" Marat.<br />
<br />
So criticism, advice, and other more personal stuff is confided to his "inside" friends. There should be a clear boundary there.<br />
<br />
What "outside" means? I think it means that at the end of the day, you have to remember you can´t have it all. You have to remember this is not your personal struggle, and that means having an utter respect for Marat. You have to put a smile on your face and think about better things to come and be happy that someone out there is trying to reach his goals.<br />
How many people don´t have any clue or do a thing for reaching their goals? Isn´t that enough reason to be glad? I think so.<br />
<br />
So keep on hoping, keep on cheering, keep on having positive thoughts... that´s if you consider yourself a true fan. <br />
<br />
If that´s too much to ask, well, you can always do something else with your free time. I don´t think most of us are full-time fans, we don´t make a living out of it or do we?. There are other things in life besides tennis. <br />
<br />
It´s just a game isn´t it? <br />
<br />
......<br />
<br />
And for some reason I am a Marat Safin fan. I know my boundaries and always respect the others. I have my best wishes for him. And if he doesn´t win, it´s not the end of the world, I don´t criticize and I don´t look for escapegoats. <br />
I´m just thankful I enjoyed another match, because I´m sure we´ll meet another time :) <br />
<br />
Sorry about the lenght, it´s like I wrote an editorial hahahahaha<br />
<br />
VAMOS MARAT!</font></tt><p>
