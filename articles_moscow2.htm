                  By Sergei Sviridov SportsTicker Contributing Writer <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  MOSCOW (TICKER) -- Two weeks ago, Marat Safin lost in the semifinals 
                  of the Kremlin Cup, disappointing Russian fans and foes alike.<br>
                  <br>
                  "(I) felt sorry for Marat because, indeed, he could have taken 
                  the lead in the ATP rankings the next week," said countrymate 
                  Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who went on to win the tournament. "I am 
                  really upset that he couldn't lead the ATP race. It would be 
                  a great way to raise his psychological confidence for the next 
                  4-5 tournaments left for the rest of the year."<br>
                  <br>
                  Apparently, Safin did not need to win at Moscow to gain the 
                  top spot or any psychological confidence. On Sunday, he won 
                  the St. Petersburg Open and overtook Brazil's Gustavo Kuerten 
                  as the leader in the ATP Champions Race 2000.<br>
                  <br>
                  During the Kremlin Cup, Safin said he had serious plans to be 
                  No. 1 in the world. Now that he has gotten there, the dedication 
                  involved in staying there may conflict with his desire to enjoy 
                  life to its fullest.<br>
                  <br>
                  For example, the night before his semifinal loss in the Kremlin 
                  Cup, Safin, 20, played doubles late into the night with Denis 
                  Golovanov, a long-time friend whom he has committed to sponsor 
                  and support in every way. The next day, however, Safin looked 
                  winded and less than himself in a loss to David Prinosil. <br>
                  <br>
                  Last month, The Moscow Times published a wire service report 
                  in which Alexander Volkov, the director of the tournament and 
                  Safin's friend and former coach, said his former pupil has an 
                  affinity for the nightlife here.<br>
                  <br>
                  "If he goes out to a nightclub, even if he stays there until 
                  four in the morning, that does not mean he drinks like a horse," 
                  Volkov said. "He has one or two beers, which is enough. It doesn't 
                  bother him. He gets enough sleep, then goes out on the court 
                  and trains."<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin later clarified that description of his behavior off the 
                  court.<br>
                  <br>
                  "(I) am not hiding!" he declared. "The thing is, I like to socialize 
                  with friends, listen to the music, sometimes have some good 
                  wine. The main thing is to control oneself".<br>
                  <br>
                  In fact, Safin knows perfectly well he must focus solely on 
                  tennis. When a very pushy female journalist from local TV tried 
                  to pin him down by asking for an interview in the cloak room 
                  of the Swiss Diamond Hotel in Moscow, where Marat had to attend 
                  a meeting with Russian dignitaries, Safin implored, "Why do 
                  they have to accost me like this?" <br>
                  <br>
                  Even though Safin made a narrow escape from the pushy TV reporter, 
                  he had a plate full of other unrelated activities. He attended 
                  two official meetings -- one with Georgy Poltavchenko, the head 
                  of the Central Federal District and Vadim Kozhin, the head of 
                  the Presidential Staff, and another with mayor Yuri Luzhkov. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Last month, Safin also joined a large Russian internet company 
                  that will require him to answer fans' queries via e-mail. Throw 
                  in the nightclubs -- of which he is an aficionado -- and perhaps 
                  you understand why he resumed his old habit of breaking rackets 
                  in his loss to Prinosil. <br>
                  <br>
                  However, Safin said his behavior comes from putting pressure 
                  on himself to achieve the sustained greatness of a Pete Sampras. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  "Sometimes I get scared I won't have such a good chance again," 
                  he said. "I am trying hard, but I will never be Sampras. I am 
                  still developing." After losing the Kremlin Cup, Safin did not 
                  beat himself up. Instead, he was out at Most -- a very new, 
                  very chic nightclub.<br>
                  <br>
                  After all, he is young, handsome and rich, and that he enjoys 
                  life makes him even more attractive to the tennis public. <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin knows he is young but also is aware he will not be young 
                  forever. He sounds like he knows the top spot in tennis is not 
                  reached by hanging out in nightclubs.<br>
                  <br>
                  "There are 1,000 players out there who also want to become No. 
                  1," he said. "To become No. 1 is possible, but to hang in there 
                  is a different story altogether." <br>
                  <br>
