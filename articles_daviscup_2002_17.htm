                  </a><br>
                  Marat Safin carried a country's hopes for its first Davis Cup 
                  championship on his shoulders when he stepped onto the red clay 
                  court at the Palais Omnisports in Paris today. And in the end, 
                  that responsibility to win for Russia is what helped carry Safin 
                  to victory.<br>
                  <br>
Playing with poise under the pressure of potential elimination, 
                    Safin swept Sebastien Grosjean 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (13-11) in the 
                    first of today's reverse singles matches to even the Davis 
                    Cup tie between Russia and defending-champion France, 2-2.<br><br>

&quot;I was praying to finish in three sets,&quot; said Safin, 
                    who was playing his third match in three days. &quot;Just 
                    when was everything finished, I was so happy. I didn't have 
                    to go to the fourth set because you never know how it can 
                    finish. He started to play well. Also, my physical condition, 
                    I was getting tired already. I wanted to finish in three sets. 
                    I was lucky that I could make it.&quot;<br>
<br>
Safin's victory set the stage for a fifth and decisive match 
                    between France's Paul-Henri Mathieu and 32nd-ranked Russian 
                    Mikhail Youzhny, who was named as a late replacement for veteran 
                    Yevgeny Kafelnikov.<br>
<br>
Former French Open champion Kafelnikov, who has surgery scheduled 
                    for tomorrow to repair a vein in his leg, has performed poorly 
                    in suffering a straight-set loss to Grosjean in Friday's singles 
                    match. Kafelnikov partnered with Safin in yesterday's four-set 
                    doubles defeat to the French team of Nicolas Escude and Fabrice 
                    Santoro.<br>
<br>
&quot;We decided to put Mikhail because Yevgeny was tired 
                    after the doubles,&quot; Safin said. &quot;He couldn't play 
                    today, so we decided to put the young player (to play the 
                    match). Why not? We'll see if he can manage to win, at least 
                    show great tennis.&quot;<br>
<br>
Despite Kafelnikov's recent struggles on clay, the decision 
                    to start Youzhny is a bit of a risk by Russian captain Shamil 
                    Tarpischev. Today's decisive match marks Youzhny's debut in 
                    a live Davis Cup match. Mathieu is not exactly a Davis Cup 
                    veteran either: he made his Davis Cup debut in Friday's singles 
                    setback to Safin.<br>
<br>
The former top-ranked Safin dominated Grosjean in their previous 
                    Parisian meeting on red clay at Roland Garros last spring. 
                    The Russian recalled the tactics he used in that match as 
                    a factor in today's triumph.<br>
<br>
&quot;Last time we played in Roland Garros, I won. I just 
                    understood how I have to play against him,&quot; Safin said. 
                    &quot;It also gave me some kind of confidence that I can beat 
                    him. Already I knew from the beginning what I have to do, 
                    when I have to do. I was also a little bit lucky at some point 
                    of the match.&quot;<br>
<br>
The gritty Grosjean refused to give up and made a late charge 
                    in the third set, but ultimately lacked the weapons to stop 
                    Safin.<br>
<br>
&quot;It's true that in the third set I had many opportunities,&quot; 
                    Grosjean said. &quot;But even in the third set, he played 
                    at a very high level. I was able to maintain the lead. I really 
                    wanted to win this third set to see what he was going to do 
                    in the fourth set, but I believe he played a very great match. 
                    He was impressive with everything: service, returns, from 
                    the baseline, he was hitting off both sides. When he plays 
                    like that, he's very difficult to beat.&quot;<br>
