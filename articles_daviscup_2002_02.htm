                    09, 2002, Olympic Stadium, Moscow, RUS, by Jo Sirman<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Marat Safin and Yevgeny Kafelnikov defeated Marc Rosset and 
                    Roger Federer in Saturday's doubles to take a 2-1 lead in 
                    Russia's first round tie with Switzerland. The Russian pair 
                    missed four match points in the third set then survived a 
                    lapse in the tiebreak which followed before finally claiming 
                    a 62 76(6) 67(0) 62 victory and the vital advantage going 
                    into the last day.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Swiss had a number of opportunities to get back into the 
                    match, the first of which came in the second set tiebreak 
                    when they pulled back from a 5-1 deficit to level at 5-5. 
                    They were unable to get ahead however, and a Rosset double 
                    fault proved costly. Having saved match points with Rosset 
                    serving at 5-4 in the third set, and going on to win the tiebreak 
                    convincingly, the visitors were then broken twice within the 
                    first three games of the fourth set and missed opportunities 
                    to break back at 41 and 52. <br>
                    <br>
                    Safin in particular looked much sharper than he had during 
                    his singles loss on Friday. &quot;I was nervous at the start, 
                    but then it worked well for us. We played well in the first 
                    two sets, and had a chance to win the third set. I think we 
                    played brilliantly in the fourth.&quot; Kafelnikov was pleased 
                    with the result and is feeling much more confident now about 
                    his country's chances of reaching the quarterfinals.<br>
                    <br>
                    It was a disappointing result for the Swiss, but although 
                    unhappy at the outcome of Saturday's match, Federer said, 
                    &quot;I still think we played really well today.&quot; It 
                    was his first loss in Davis Cup doubles. Federer must now 
                    defeat Kafelnikov in the first of Sunday's reverse singles 
                    matches for Switzerland to stand any chance of winning in 
                    Moscow.<br>
                    <br>
                    Russia started convincingly, breaking Federer's serve in the 
                    very first game as both Federer and Rosset missed easy volleys. 
                    With the 8,000 Russian fans - including Boris Yeltsin - getting 
                    behind their team much more loudly than on Friday, and the 
                    home bench waving a large Russian flag, Kafelnikov and Safin 
                    were inspired to another break four games later, again on 
                    Federer's serve, set up with a great Safin forehand sent down 
                    the line. The balance had changed from Friday's opening singles 
                    match, with Safin a better player than Federer, who struggled 
                    at the net early on. Kafelnikov resisted a breakpoint on his 
                    serve to win the first set 62.<br>
                    <br>
                    Some accurate and unreturnable first serves from Safin got 
                    him out of trouble at 15-40 in the second game of the second 
                    set, but the Swiss broke the Russian No. 2's serve for a 4-2 
                    lead. To the delight of the fans, Safin and Kafelnikov immediately 
                    broke back for 4-3, and with the Swiss unable to convert another 
                    break point in Safin's next service game a tiebreak followed. 
                    Having clawed their way back into contention from 5-1 down, 
                    Rosset and Federer lost the breaker 8-6, a replayed point 
                    that had originally looked like going in Rosset's favour giving 
                    Russia the second set.<br>
                    <br>
                    The nations traded breaks again in the third set, but at 54 
                    and 15-40 on Rosset's serve the Russians were unable to close 
                    out the match, failing to convert four match points as the 
                    visitors stood firm before running away with the tiebreak 
                    7-0.<br>
                    <br>
                    Safin and Kafelnikov jumped to a 4-0 lead in the fourth set, 
                    and despite some plucky play, particularly from Federer who 
                    lifted his game whilst on court, the visitors were unable 
                    to claw back either of the two breaks. In the end Safin served 
                    out the match, the Swiss saving a further match point before 
                    Russia claimed victory 62 76(6) 67(0) 62.<br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;We shouldn't have lost a 4-2 lead in the third set, 
                    and should never have been playing the tiebreaker, where we 
                    gave away the initiative to our adversaries&quot;, Kafelnikov 
                    admitted. However the Russians have regained their confidence 
                    in Moscow and are looking forward to Sunday. &quot;All the 
                    components are important but the man with the stronger will 
                    will win&quot; says the Russian No. 1.<br>
