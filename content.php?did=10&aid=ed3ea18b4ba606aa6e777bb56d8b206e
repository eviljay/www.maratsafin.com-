<td class="article-body"><P><EM><EM><STRONG>27.11.05 <U>Marat News</U><BR>Well finally Marat is going to start practice! He will fly to Valencia on Wednesday 30th November and&nbsp;will be working&nbsp;with a new model of racquet from Head. It is a new version of the Prestige but no further details available as yet. This is good news - Marat feels at home in Valencia and his start for the 2006 season will begin. </STRONG></EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>02.11.05 Marat News<BR>Marat&nbsp;will officially withdraw from playing at the Shanghai Masters Cup BUT he will go there to do promotional work for the Masters Cup and Shanghai. So people in Shanghai will still see him and I am sure there will be chances for signing for people too.<BR>For Paris fans - Marat will be in Bercy this weekend as he will present the winner's trophy&nbsp;to the lucky winner.<BR>In the meantime he is continuing working on the knee rehabilitation and we will have a better idea after Shanghai as to his schedule leading up to the Australian Open.<BR></STRONG></P></EM>
<P><EM><STRONG>26.10.05 Marat has officially withdrawn from the Master Series at Bercy starting next week. He joins several other players who will not appear for mainly injury problems.</STRONG></EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>20.10.05 Well as usual Marat has had a slight change of plan. <BR>He visted Tver on the 19th together with Peter Lundgren to discuss ways of helping to further tennis in the Tverskoy region. Although&nbsp;Marat is the tennis player who has made it, he&nbsp;also wants to&nbsp;ensure that there will be a new tennis generation&nbsp;to&nbsp;continue the good work for&nbsp;Russia. This he is doing by helping the federations in various regions to progress.<BR>Then although he is not playing in St. Petersburg, he is hoping to go there for an autograph session and at least be there for a short time for the local fans.<BR>After that he goes to Paris early next week as he has certain promotion items to do for Adidas and also to practice. Whatever happens Marat is determined to try and play as he needs to&nbsp;get back on court. More than anything he wants to go to Shanghai and participate in the year end Masters Cup. It means a lot to him.</STRONG></EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>16.10.05 Bad news I am sorry to say especially for the Russian fans. Marat has had to withdraw from the St. Petersburg Open as his knee is not yet ready.<BR>For the French fans in Paris - look out for Marat in your city as he will be there from Monday practising to see if he can get his knee fit in time for Bercy.<BR>It is a long hard battle and we must keep him in our thoughts.Marat did find time to watch sister Dinara at the Kremlin Cup this week and he was very proud of her getting to the semis in both singles and doubles.</STRONG></EM></P>
<P><EM><EM><STRONG>02.10.05 There is good news and bad news - depending on how you look at it. <BR>The good news is the knee injury is progressing well&nbsp; - the bad news is that it has been decided that Marat will not play until the St. Petersburg Open followed by Bercy and then Shanghai Masters Cup. Ths will give him some practice before the end of the season to test out the knee and then he will start the new season of 2006 fully fit. At this stage it has not been confirmed which tournament he will start with in 2006 but it is anticipated he will start with a regular tournament&nbsp;rather than an exhibition match.</STRONG></EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>25.09.05 Marat is continuing his daily treatment on his knee and working hard. No news as yet as to when we can expect him back playing.<BR>In the meantime Marat has been enjoying the social events in Moscow. This last week he was seen at Gallery Triumph Presentation of new collection by DSquared2.&nbsp; <BR>People of the Year by GQ where Marat was nominated for Sportsman of the Year.<BR>Attended Sports &amp; Style awards ceremony on 21/09<BR>He and Dinara were at the MTV Russia Music Awards on the 22/09<BR>Busy time keeping up with being a celebrity!</STRONG></EM></P></EM>
<P><EM><STRONG>18.09.05 Marat is progressing well with his treatment - still working early every day but it is too&nbsp;soon to say when he will be ready.<BR>With regards to the Japan Open - officially Marat has not withdrawn but as there is no guarantee that he will be able to play, it was felt that the tournament director should be allowed to negotiate for another player in case of&nbsp; Marat not being ready to play.So this is what his management team have told the director of the tournament. Should Marat be ready then he will play. Unfortunately with the injury it is not possible to give any definite answers at this time.<BR>He definitely is not playing the Thai Open and a press release was made this weekend about this. <BR>With regards to the Thai Airways advert, he will travel to Bangkok at&nbsp;some stage for a weekend to complete&nbsp;the advert/video.<BR>At this stage it is not anticipated that Marat will travel to Split to support the DC team but with Marat anything could change.</STRONG></EM><EM></P></EM>
<P><EM><STRONG>14.09.05 Marat is so determined to get his knee better and play again - he is working on it everyday from 8am to 12noon. Now for those who know Marat well - that is quite something! Marat does not like getting up early and even his management are amazed at his dedication. </STRONG></EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>09.09.05 Marat Update<BR>Marat had his consultation with Dr Lohrer on Monday in Frankfurt and his first session of&nbsp;treatment. He then went to Moscow to attend the funeral on Wednesday 07/09 of his friend Leonid Nerushenko who died tragically on Saturday in a motorbike accident. Understandably Marat was very upset by the death of his friend and as he has been away from home so much lately, felt he wanted to stay near to family and friends. It has been established that the same treatment is available in Moscow so Marat is happy that he can stay at home and continue his treatment. The course covers 5 hours a day of Physio, shockwave treatment, gym and massage and will last 5 weeks. <BR>Therefore it is anticipated that all being well, Marat will be fit for the Japan Open in Tokyo on 3rd October.<BR>We will keep you informed of developments. This is a very hard time for Marat dealing with the death of a close friend and his injury and knowing he has so many points to defend. So keep him in your thoughts - he needs all the love and support of his fans to help him through this difficult time.</STRONG></EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>04.09.05 Marat Update<BR>To quote a certain PC Advert&nbsp; " Change of Plan".<BR>Marat did not go back to Bologna - instead he consulted with Dr. Feder in New York whose opinion he respects and on his recommendation Marat is now in Frankfurt Germany where tomorrow Monday he has an appointment with Dr. Heinz Lohrer at the Sports Medicine Institute. Dr. Lohrer has presented papers on Radial Shockwave Therapy for the treatment of "Jumpers Knee" and achilles tendonitis. After his consultation we will know more about what has to be done for Marat's knee but it is anticipated&nbsp;Marat will spend at least 2 weeks in Frankfurt. Marat is determined to do everything possible to get his knee back in good working order.<BR>To read more about Dr Heinz Lohrer and the Institute </STRONG><A href="http://www.smi-frankfurt.de/English/Inhalte2/Areas/director.html" target=_blank><U><STRONG>click here</STRONG></U></A><BR><STRONG>And for more details on Radial Shockwave Therapy </STRONG><A href="http://www.ems-dent.com/medical/en/orthopaedics_swiss_dolorclast.htm" target=_blank><U><STRONG>click here</STRONG></U></A></EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>28.08.05 <BR>Regrettably we have to announce that&nbsp;Marat is withdrawing from the US Open. Although Marat wanted&nbsp;more than anything&nbsp;to play and has tried whatever he could to be ready, as a professional tennis player he has had to admit that his body is saying it is too soon. So he has made the decision after discussions with all those around him. He is not depressed because he realises this is the right thing to do. He will return to Italy to continue treatment at the Isokinetic and ensure that his knee is fully recovered. His one regret is that he is disappointing his fans who wanted to see him play. It is not known how long he will be out but we will keep you informed. This time he will make sure he does not rush into returning. Marat still wants to play his tennis and he will be back. As his fans he needs your support more than ever. <BR>Peace</STRONG></EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>For all those who might feel that we were giving the wrong impression, please note this was because Marat himself was saying he was fine. Marat has to make his own decisions and we have to abide by them.&nbsp;As with if&nbsp;anyone is ill, the medical people&nbsp;always tell you "He'll be fine!"&nbsp; We were always hopeful but in the end&nbsp;one's body is the one that makes the final decision.</STRONG></EM></P></EM>
<P><STRONG><EM>26.08.05 Marat News<BR>Dr Feder has advised Marat with regards to practice to&nbsp;do one day on and one day off. So Marat did not practice Thursday, will practice Friday, no practice Saturday, practice Sunday and then he will play his first match Monday.He is feeling fine and pleased with the way the knee is responding.</EM></STRONG></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>25.08.05 Marat News<BR>Marat had a good practice yesterday with a lot less pain so it would seem the new inner soles are solving the problem. Marat has seen the draw but as he has frequently said - he doesn't look ahead - just takes each game as it comes.</STRONG></EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>24.08.05 Marat News<BR>The mystery has been solved! Marat has always worn special inner soles in his trainers but back before Roland Garros when he was practising in Valencia for the clay season, the inner soles broke and it was unfortunately two weeks before he got new ones and during this time he played without them. From that moment on he had problems with his knee. So now he has new inner soles which are higher on the heel therefore putting less pressure on the knee. As with basketball players, he is wearing a protective strip under his knee. He now has all the support needed to help during actual work on the tennis court particularly on his serve which is the area he was finding particularly difficult.<BR></STRONG></EM><EM><STRONG><BR>23.08.05 Marat News<BR>Marat has been joined in New York by Dr. Feder of LA who treated him in 2003 for his wrist injury. Working together with him and the physio, Marat is starting to feel a lot better. He will practice again today.</STRONG></EM></P>
<P><EM><STRONG>22.08.05 Marat News<BR>Marat will start practising today in New York. He has a doctor arriving from Russia to be with him as well as he&nbsp;has a fitness trainer and others around him. He is being very sensible about this and will make sure that he does everything correctly with regards to his knee. Marat was pleased that he did managed to complete 3 rounds in Cincinnati considering he had played no tennis since June.As you know Marat loves New York so he feels good about being there.<BR></STRONG></EM><EM><BR><STRONG>21.08.05 Marat News<BR>Marat had an MRI on his knee yesterday and all is okay. He has flown to New York and has a physiotherapist recommended by Wesley Moodie, who&nbsp;Marat will be working with in New York. He will start practising in New York this week in preparation for the US Open.</STRONG></P>
<P></EM><STRONG>11.08.05 Marat &amp; Peter are in Moscow while Marat sorts out what he needs for the US having been in Italy for over a month. The treatment went well and he is feeling fit &amp;&nbsp;ready although a bit short of match practice. He &amp; Peter travel to the US Friday 12th and they will arrive in Cincinnati Friday night. Also travelling with Marat for this part of the tour will be his childhood fitness coach from Valencia Miguel M. There is a good chance that Marat will apply for a Wild Card for New Haven to get extra match practice before the US Open.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>05.08.05 Marat News</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Marat is fine and so is his knee. The treatment has gone well despite reports to the contrary&nbsp;circulating from the Russian Press. Marat has been practising in Bologna since Monday&nbsp;01/08 with Davide Scala of Italy.&nbsp;Davide's claim to fame - Marat beat him in the 1st round of qualifying for the French Open in 1998 - the year Marat went on to beat Andre Agassi in the main draw.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Marat has been practising on clay to get himself physically fit. He is staying in Bologna instead of going to Valencia and tomorrow Saturday Peter Lundgren will join him. On Monday Marat will start practising on hardcourts. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Thursday 11/08 Marat and Peter will fly to Moscow for Marat to pick up all his clothes etc and then on Friday 12/08,&nbsp;they will fly to Cincinnati for the Masters Series Cincinnati.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>04.08.05 Officially Marat is only withdrawing today - it seems that the news leaked early to the press.Please note that it was always a possibility with his knee treatment that he would not make Montreal. After practising in Bologna it was decided that&nbsp;he would not be ready for Montreal. Marat will go to Valencia this weekend and practice there and then fly to Cincinnati next Friday. It is still his intention to play Cincinnati.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>30.07.05 Marat is spending the weekend in San Tropez and then will start&nbsp;tennis practice in Bologna on Monday. He feels good and ready to play.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>This practice on Monday will be the final test on the knee and from there it will be decided if he is ready for the hard grind of the tennis on the US Hardcourts. Marat does not want to rush it and then have a relapse as happened previously with his wrist in 2003.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>We will keep you posted.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>27.07.05 Marat Update<BR>Marat has stepped up his work in the gym and the knee is holding up fine. He will leave Bologna on Tuesday and then concentrate on tennis practice to build up to Montreal. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>23.07.05 Confusion reigns - Is it treatment or surgery? </STRONG><A href="/content.php?did=10&amp;aid=121d73cbad3a7eca3bce671cd0943458" target=_blank><STRONG>See here for why it should be taken as treatment!</STRONG></A></P>
<P><STRONG>14.07.05 Please note there have been a few reports stating that Marat will be fit for the US Open and incorrectly giving&nbsp;the impression that Marat will not play in the 2 Masters Series. We would like to stress that Marat will play in Montreal and Cincinnati before the US Open. This is the reason why he elected to have treatment for his knee in&nbsp;July to&nbsp;ensure he was fit to play.</STRONG></P>
<P><U><STRONG>14/07/05 - SAFIN GUEST OF THE ISOKINETIC</STRONG></U></P>
<P><STRONG>In recent years the Isokinetic has become the leading centre mainly credited with the recovery of injured players with particular reference to soccer. This absolutely deserved reputation, has seen them restore athletes of the caliber of Baggio and Signori to you (there are many more but we cite just some), and this reputation has even reached Russia. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>In fact, from the beginning of the week, Marat Safin has chosen the Bologna centre in order to recover from tendinopathy to the knee. For those who do not follow tennis, it is right to emphasize that the popular Moscovite&nbsp; is currently the n°5 in the world of this sport and that in 2005 alone he has won at &nbsp;the Australian Open, and recently reached the third round of Wimbledon.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>During the 7 years of his professional career Marat Safin has won 15 ATP titles including the US Open and as such is considered to have been judged a top player.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Therefore it is obvious that his arrival under the Two Towers has not gone unnoticed and it is he who explains why he has chosen Bologna and the Isokinetic. I have had problems for two months, but I have tried to continue my playing activity. But the problem increased and I therefore went to Belgium to see Professor Maertens (the same one that operated on the Marchionni of Parma) and the Professor recommended Doctor Marcacci, and he in turn recommended the Isokinetic.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Here he was put in the care of Dr. Gianni Nanni and entrusted to the cures of Antonio. They are all good persons - emphasized Safin speaking in Italian - and I find myself very well.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Between an ice cream and all the other (a sympathetic initiative from the director Mark Zanbbi and his staff for the good will of the patients and something that Safin appreciates a lot) is just one of the therapies to follow. In the morning I go to the swimming pool and in the afternoon I jog in the arena. For now it is estimated to last two weeks, and then we will see. Also it is necessary to complete this to go across the ocean for the US Open which is getting closer and closer. I want to start again with going to Montreal or at the very least to Cincinnati. He enjoys Bologna but has seen little apart from one previous vacation in Rome. Of the city I have only seen the roads on the way from the hotel (that for reasons of privacy we do not name, apart from saying that it is in the centre) to the Isokinetic.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>It seems to me to be a beautiful place. I do not have any intention of going to Rimini (where several tennis colleagues are involved in a Challenger Series) but I would definitely want to make one vacation without tennis to Marine Milan . Dreams are all quite real for a young person of 25 years but he jokes that he is getting old as a professional tennis player - I am too old for the Davis Cup! At least in his opinion, one of the reasons why he is not appearing in the match against France on clay in Moscow. As a quality player we have only Davydenko, it will be hard.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Article taken from </STRONG><A href="http://www.sportpress.it/tennis.htm"><STRONG>http://www.sportpress.it/tennis.htm</STRONG></A></P>
<P><STRONG>Thanks to fan ivan77 for posting news of the article on the fan forum.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>14.07.05 Marat Update</P>
<P>Marat was in&nbsp;quite a lot of&nbsp;pain after the treatment on Monday but since then he feels much better. He works in the gym daily to strengthen his knee. In fact Marat felt so much better he wanted to fly to Moscow to be with the team as support for Davis Cup but the doctor would not permit it. If&nbsp;he continues to improve Marat should be okay to start practising tennis in 10 days time.</P>
<P>11.07.05 The correct term for what Marat is being treated for is Patellar Tendinopathy and further details re this condition can be found on the following website <A href="http://www.physsportsmed.com/issues/2004/0504/depalma.htm" target=_blank>here</A></P>
<P>An idea of the type of treatment that can be followed can be found <A href="http://bjsm.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/extract/35/5/291" target=_blank>here</A><BR>This does not give the exact treatment - that is determined by Dr Marcacci with whom Marat is currently working but it will give an idea of&nbsp;the type of treatment Marat will be undergoing in the next two weeks.</P></STRONG>
<P><STRONG>10.07.05 Marat Update <BR>There was a delay in Marat's treatment starting. Under ATP rules all new treatments have to be passed by the Anti-Doping Committee before commencing and this approval was only received on Friday 8th July. Therefore Marat's treatment will now start Monday 11 July 2005 and continue for two weeks. Procedures have to be followed by all under the rules and regulations of the ATP. Any new updates will be posted as and when received</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>05.07.05 Marat News</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>Marat is at present working with Dr Maurilio Marcacci, a renowned knee surgeon of the Istituto Ortopedico Rizzoli Bologna</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>After a weeks rest, on Thursday 7 July, Marat will have a small operation on his left&nbsp;knee to repair the tear in the ligament. After that he will follow the normal recuperation laid out by the Istituto and then prepare for the US Hardcourt season.</STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG>He will not play Davis Cup despite some earlier reports that he would. In the latest announcement from the Russian Tennis Federation, his name does not appear in the team for the Davis Cup Tie versus France.</STRONG></P></td>
