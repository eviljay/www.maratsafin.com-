                  Feb 07, 2002, Olympic Stadium, Moscow, RUS, by Jo Sirman<br>
                  <br>
                  Australian Open runner-up Marat Safin will open Russia's campaign 
                  to win the 2002 Davis Cup by BNP Paribas when he faces Roger 
                  Federer in the opening rubber of the Moscow tie on Friday. Switzerland 
                  has chosen Michel Kratochvil as its second singles player, and 
                  he will take on Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the second rubber.<br>
                  <br>
                  The opening clash between two of this season's in-form players 
                  has all the makings of a classic. It will be only the second 
                  time that Safin and Federer have met, but it was the Swiss player 
                  who prevailed at the Tennis Masters Series event in Rome when 
                  they played in the second round there last year. Psychologically 
                  this is good news for Federer, since the Russians have chosen 
                  to play on the same surface - clay - at the Olympic Stadium.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Getting used to the clay is tough for both teams in the 
                  middle of the indoor season,&quot; Federer pointed out however. 
                  &quot;It's going to be who's better mentally.&quot; Having already 
                  appeared in two finals this year, winning the title in Sydney 
                  and losing in Milan last weekend, Federer says that his body 
                  feels fine and he is ready to go: &quot;confidence is as important 
                  as feeling fit.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Mental advantage could be on the side of the Russians when it 
                  comes to Friday's second match. With Switzerland choosing the 
                  rapidly improving Michel Kratochvil for singles duty, Kafelnikov 
                  has escaped a meeting with nemesis Marc Rosset, a man against 
                  whom he has a losing 4-10 record and describes as &quot;uncomfortable&quot; 
                  for him to play. <br>
                  <br>
                  Kafelnikov defeated the 22-year-old Kratochvil in their only 
                  previous meeting at last year's US Open, but says the absence 
                  of Rosset &quot;doesn't mean my match with Kratochvil will be 
                  an easy one&quot;. Kratochvil has only played one other live 
                  Davis Cup match, losing to Jan-Michael Gambill in Switzerland's 
                  first round defeat of the United States last year. He seems 
                  confident nonetheless. &quot;It's a challenge. We're not the 
                  favorites but our team is great, we practice well this week. 
                  We have a chance to make a good result here this week.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Kafelnikov and Safin will also team up in the doubles against 
                  Federer and veteran Rosset, although the pairings could change 
                  up to one hour before play on Saturday. Likewise Sunday's scheduled 
                  meetings between Kafelnikov and Federer then Safin and Kratochvil 
                  could alter, although it seems unlikely that, barring injury, 
                  Russia would make any team changes if the tie is still live. 
                  The hosts made one change however ahead of Thursday's draw, 
                  replacing Andrei Stoliarov with 31-year-old veteran Andrei Cherkasov 
                  in their team of four. <br>
                  <br>
                  At lot has changed - not least the name and boundaries of the 
                  host country - since these two nations last played each other, 
                  casting doubt over the significance of Switzerland's 2-0 advantage 
                  in previous encounters with Russia, or the USSR as it then was. 
                  They last met in Davos, Switzerland in 1991, with both Cherkasov 
                  and Rosset part of a tie that was won by the home team 3-2. 
                  Prior to that Russia hosted the Swiss in Donetsk in 1987, the 
                  tie slipping away from them in the decisive fifth rubber.<br>
                  <br>
                  Kafelnikov has made it clear that bringing the Davis Cup trophy 
                  home to Russia would complete his career and rate alongside 
                  his two Grand Slam titles and Olympic Gold medal. In addition 
                  to its No. 1 player's determination, Russia, twice a finalist 
                  in the competition but never the champion, can add the chance 
                  of enough home advantage this year to help that dream become 
                  a reality.<br>
                  <br>
                  The hosts know though that Switzerland will be a tricky opponent, 
                  with Federer capable of inspiring his teammates to great things. 
                  In last year's first round tie against the United States in 
                  Basle, the Swiss 20-year-old played some inspirational tennis, 
                  winning all three of his matches to lift his country to a 3-2 
                  victory. Kratochvil has already been a semi-finalist in Auckland 
                  this year, while Rosset, despite his sliding ranking, has a 
                  36-19 record in Davis Cup. Russian Captain Shamil Tarpischev 
                  is expecting some close matches in Moscow. <br>
                  <br>
                  At stake for the winner of this tie is a quarterfinal meeting 
                  with either Great Britain or Sweden, who face off in Birmingham 
                  this weekend.<br>
