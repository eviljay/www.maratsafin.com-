                  Russian Tennis Rebel on a Roll - January 16 <br>
                  <br>
                  By Mike Steinberger<br>
                  Financial Times<br>
                  <br>
                  In tennis, as in life, there are two ways to announce your arrival: 
                  loudly or softly. In the case of Marat Safin, the charming but 
                  combustible Russian goliath, it was apparent from the start 
                  that his march up the rankings would not be a quiet one.<br>
                  Three years ago, at the age of 18, Safin enjoyed a spectacular 
                  French Open debut, knocking out both Andre Agassi and defending 
                  champion Gustavo Kuerten en route to the fourth round. After 
                  this came a tragi-comic slump that saw dozens of rackets disembowelled 
                  as Safin's game abandoned him and he even considered a premature 
                  retirement. He might well be sitting on a park bench today, 
                  feeding the pigeons, were it not for the pep talk he received 
                  last April from his compatriot Andrei Chesnokov, a former player 
                  all too familiar with the agony of underachievement.<br>
                  <br>
                  Chesnokov's exhortations somehow penetrated Safin's usually 
                  impregnable psyche; the sulking prodigy burst out of his rut 
                  and became nearly unbeatable, capping a brilliant run with his 
                  annihilation of Pete Sampras in the US Open final in September. 
                  Straight sets, 90 minutes, Sampras shell-shocked and virtually 
                  in tears. Safin didn't merely announce his arrival that surreal 
                  Sunday afternoon; true to form, he bellowed it.<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, as the curtain rises on the Australian Open - the first 
                  grand slam of the year begins on Monday in Melbourne - the spotlight, 
                  naturally, is on Safin, who has several big questions confronting 
                  him. Can he capture another of tennis's crown jewels or will 
                  he join the sport's long list of one-hit wonders? Is the erratic, 
                  temperamental Safin of old really banished, or just hibernating? 
                  More pressingly, will a niggling elbow injury that forced him 
                  to withdraw from a Melbourne warm-up exhibition on Wednesday 
                  dash his chances down under?<br>
                  <br>
                  Doubts also swirl around him on account of his nationality and 
                  the rather sorry record of recent Russian tennis stars. Over 
                  the past decade or so, the men's tour has seen a handful of 
                  gifted Russians - Alexander Volkov, Andrei Medvedev, Yevgeny 
                  Kafelnikov, as well as Chesnokov - come barrelling down the 
                  baseline, only to be distracted by all the wealth and celebrity 
                  thrust on them. Can Safin avoid falling into the money-and-honey 
                  trap? He doesn't seem particularly worried about this, or anything 
                  else, at the moment. Indeed, he arrives in Australia in an unburdened 
                  state of mind, still savouring his US Open triumph.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I'm just very happy that I have my first grand slam title 
                  in the bag,&quot; he says. &quot;It has taken me to another 
                  level. Now, people respect me, everyone takes me seriously, 
                  and the other players know they are going to really have to 
                  fight to beat me.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  But Safin is quick to warn that his satisfaction should in no 
                  way be construed as complacency: &quot;I want to win the Australian, 
                  and I want the number one ranking.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  He is even more emphatic about his long-term prospects. &quot;There 
                  is no chance that I'm not going to win another grand slam title.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  The Moscow native has the ability and the arsenal to win more 
                  than a few majors. His rich potential first drew international 
                  notice seven years ago, when Safin was brought to the attention 
                  of Spanish coach Rafael Mensua. At the time, the teenager was 
                  trained by his parents, Misha and Rausa. But with Marat, who 
                  takes his name from an 18th century French revolutionary, growing 
                  more skilled, and stubborn, by the match, Misha decided his 
                  son's career would be best served by going abroad, and he secured 
                  for him a scholarship to Mensua's tennis academy in Valencia, 
                  Spain. It was here that the raw talent was turned into something 
                  more bankable. It was a process helped by the 10 inches in height 
                  Safin gained while under Mensua's tutelage. He is now 6ft 4in, 
                  which explains why 130 miles-an-hour serves fly off his racket 
                  with such regularity.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin used Valencia as his base until last summer, when he and 
                  his chequebook made the inevitable escape to tax-haven Monte 
                  Carlo. He returns to Moscow several times a year, where his 
                  parents are engaged in another project: his sister, Dinara, 
                  a promising junior.<br>
                  <br>
                  In contrast to most of his peers, Safin gives some consideration 
                  to the world beyond the doubles alley, and he doesn't hesitate 
                  to share his views. When queried about the seemingly dire situation 
                  in his homeland, he pounces as if presented with an easy overhead: 
                  &quot;CNN, the BBC - they exaggerate about what is going on 
                  in Russia. I get really pissed off by the things they say on 
                  TV. They only show the problems. They say people are dying in 
                  Russia. Well, look at [New York's] the Bronx and all the people 
                  who get killed there. Why only talk about Russia?&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin is perhaps better appreciated, however, for his deadpan 
                  humour than his geopolitical observations. The quips work particularly 
                  well when voiced in his chunky English. Minutes after beating 
                  Sampras at the US Open, for instance, he was asked courtside 
                  how he had engineered such a lopsided victory over the player 
                  many consider history's greatest. &quot;Think I know?&quot; 
                  came the thickly accented, baritone reply, sending a ripple 
                  of laughter through the stands.<br>
                  <br>
                  Four months later, he is still groping for an explanation, albeit 
                  in a slightly more serious manner: &quot;How do you describe 
                  a day when you are just perfect, when every ball goes inside 
                  the court? I have no idea why I played so well, but it was a 
                  good moment to have it happen.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin has a clearer understanding of why he fell to both Sampras 
                  and Agassi in the Tennis Masters Cup in Lisbon in December, 
                  losses that cost him the No 1 ranking for 2000. He attributes 
                  the defeats to the two tournaments he played before arriving 
                  in Lisbon, which he says drained him of what little fuel he 
                  had left in the tank at the season's end.<br>
                  <br>
                  Besides laying claim to the top spot again - and holding on 
                  to it this time - Safin has several other immediate goals. He 
                  would like to improve both his footwork and his volleying. In 
                  part because he still struggles at the net, he remains uncomfortable 
                  on grass. Thus, Wimbledon may frustrate him a while longer. 
                  He hopes that will not be the case with the French Open, which 
                  is the championship he most covets.<br>
                  <br>
                  And rivals? He is not prepared to write off either Sampras or 
                  Agassi. Among his fellow &quot;new balls&quot;, as the tour's 
                  advertising campaign dubs the sport's up-and-coming stars, he 
                  reckons his toughest challenger will be last year's world No 
                  7 Lleyton Hewitt, the fiery Australian whippet. He also expects 
                  problems from Switzerland's Roger Federer and Spain's Juan Carlos 
                  Ferrero.<br>
                  <br>
                  But after his US Open win, most tennis aficionados believe the 
                  future belongs to Safin - assuming, of course, that he has truly 
                  exorcised his demons. He is undoubtedly maturing; he is abusing 
                  fewer rackets these days and is less apt to self-destruct when 
                  struggling with shots.<br>
                  <br>
                  On the other hand, he is, by his own admission, basically uncoachable. 
                  In fact, he is currently without a coach. After months of tension, 
                  he and Mensua split up last spring, and Safin has since gone 
                  through several &quot;advisers&quot;, including Chesnokov and 
                  Volkov. The only adult supervision for now is provided by Ion 
                  Tiriac, the colourful Romanian and former manager of Boris Becker, 
                  who serves in a consultative role. But it is hard to gauge just 
                  how much influence Tiriac has over his feisty charge.<br>
                  <br>
                  It may be Safin is just not very receptive to other opinions. 
                  Certainly, it is telling that he claims to have no role model. 
                  He also makes plain that he has no intention of emulating Sampras's 
                  single-minded, monastic pursuit of trophies. &quot;I am not 
                  that type of guy,&quot; he says. &quot;I try to have a normal 
                  life. I like to go to the cinema, to bars, to good restaurants.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  A headstrong bon vivant might not be an obvious candidate for 
                  tennis immortality, but then, not every headstrong bon vivant 
                  is a once-in-a-generation talent.<br>
                  <br>
                  The next few years will show whether Safin has the discipline 
                  and determination to cash in fully on his genius for the game. 
                  Whatever happens, he is going to do it his way.<br>
