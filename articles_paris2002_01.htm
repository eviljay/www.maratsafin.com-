                    Paris, France<br>
                    <br>
                    Playing the type of hard-hitting, aggressive style that has 
                    won him two Tennis Masters Series Shields and a US Open title, 
                    Marat Safin advanced to the final of the BNP Paribas Masters 
                    on Saturday with a win over Carlos Moya. <br>
                    <br>
                    Safin, who has yet to win a title this year, took advantage 
                    of a loose service game by Moya in the 12th game to take the 
                    first set and then pulled away in the second set tiebreak 
                    with several service winners and one final passing shot. His 
                    7-5, 7-6(4) victory puts him in Sunday’s final against the 
                    winner of the second semifinal between Paradorn Srichaphan 
                    and Lleyton Hewitt. <br>
                    <br>
                    The one hour and 37 minute encounter that saw both players 
                    display their best game.<br>
<br>
A first set filled with thrills as both players got slowly 
                    into the match testing each other's strategies. Marat Safin 
                    on one hand had the upper hand with three break opportunities 
                    and seven aces while Carlos Moya's determination helped him 
                    put the pressure on the Russian.<br>
                    <br>
                    But Safin's calm, precision and amazing footwork at the net 
                    granted him the first set with a break at 6-5 and a drop volley 
                    after 45 minutes of play in front of a packed Palais Omisport 
                    in Bercy.<br>
<br>
Safin dominated the second and final set from beginning to 
                    end with a perfect and graceful game that combined passing 
                    shots, volleys and serves that averaged 200km/h forcing Moya 
                    to work hard to hold serve.<br>
<br>
Nevertheless, Moya never let go forcing Safin to play a tie 
                    break before celebrating. The tiebreak that was a deja vu 
                    sensation for both players where nerves of steel were needed 
                    to put up with the pressure. Safin was flawless but the Spaniard 
                    produced crucial mistakes that cost him the match losing the 
                    tiebreak 7-4 after Safin arrowed a forehand down the line 
                    for victory.<br>
        
                    <br>
                    If Safin’s consistency has at times been questioned in the 
                    past, there is no doubt he has found his form this week in 
                    Paris. After defeating the attacking Frenchman, Nicolas Escude, 
                    in the quarterfinals, Safin stopped the sensational run of 
                    Carlos Moya, who was playing perhaps the best tennis of anyone 
                    at the Palais Omnisports. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Now I'm playing and I'm doing the things in the right 
                    moment and right way. And everything is just going inside 
                    the court. That makes the difference, you know, to play important 
                    points down the line or just go to the net and not be afraid,&quot; 
                    said the Russian after advancing to his third Paris final. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Moya had expended much of his mental energy in earlier rounds, 
                    playing in two consecutive must-win matches in order to guarantee 
                    a berth to the year-end Tennis Masters Cup in Shanghai. Still, 
                    the Spaniard fought valiantly, even fighting off a match point 
                    on his serve at 5-6 to force a tiebreak. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Looking back at this week, it was excellent. I came 
                    here, I was out of the Masters Cup. I'm leaving here, and 
                    I'm in. So that's good,&quot; said the Spaniard about the 
                    week.<br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Also, I played my best tennis. Especially against Agassi. 
                    That match was great. So it's been a great experience this 
                    week,&quot; Moya continued. <br>
                    <br>
                    But Safin, who had already qualified for Shanghai with his 
                    second round win on Wednesday, played consistent tennis throughout 
                    the late stages of the match.<br>
                    <br>
                    Safin returns to a Masters Series final for the second time 
                    this year after losing to Roger Federer at TMS Hamburg in 
                    May. And after winning this event in 2000, Safin will also 
                    be looking to become just the fourth man to win the BNP Paribas 
                    Masters at least twice following Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras 
                    and Boris Becker.<br>
                    <br>
                    Moya will now have 10 days to rest and prepare for the Tennis 
                    Masters Cup. He reached the final of the year-end ATP World 
                    Championship in 1998, losing to countryman Alex Corretja. 
                    Playing some of the best tennis of his life, the former World 
                    No. 1 has also gained a tremendous amount of confidence in 
                    his indoor game with his three wins here Paris this week.<br>
