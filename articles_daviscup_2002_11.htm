                  Sports - Reuters <br>
                  By Gennady Fyodorov<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  MOSCOW (Reuters) - Marat Safin says he is looking forward to 
                  facing France in the Davis Cup final in Paris or Marseille because 
                  there is far too much pressure on him when he plays at home. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;It is just too much,&quot; the Russian number one said 
                  after he clinched the semi-final tie against Argentina by beating 
                  David Nalbandian in the first reverse singles match on Sunday. 
                  <br>
                  Safin overpowered the Wimbledon finalist 7-6 6-7 6-0 6-3 in 
                  front of a noisy home crowd at Moscow's Luzhniki Sports Palace 
                  to give Russia an unassailable 3-1 lead in the three-day tie.<br>
                  <br>
                  But he found the encounter stressful. &quot;It's just too difficult 
                  for me to play at home,&quot; said the 22-year-old Muscovite. 
                  <br>
                  &quot;I have so many friends here and everyone expects you to 
                  win. They won't settle for anything less than that.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin was the hero of the weekend, winning both his singles 
                  matches and partnering Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the longest doubles 
                  match in Davis Cup history on Saturday. <br>
                  <br>
                  The Russians eventually lost to Lukas Arnold and Nalbandian 
                  after a marathon lasting six hours and 20 minutes to set up 
                  the decisive match in which Safin had to battle his opponent, 
                  fatigue and the expectations of the home fans, including former 
                  President Boris Yeltsin. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;Please, don't get me wrong,&quot; the former U.S. Open 
                  champion pleaded with the Russian media after the match. <br>
                  &quot;It's not that I don't want to play here, in front of the 
                  home crowd. It's just the pressure that I can to do without.&quot; 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  BOOED OFF <br>
                  <br>
                  Such pressure troubles Safin so much that last year he angrily 
                  vowed never to play in Russia again after he was booed off the 
                  court following his loss to the unseeded Slovak Dominik Hrbaty 
                  in the second round of the Kremlin Cup in Moscow. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I have never been so humiliated in my whole life,&quot; 
                  the temperamental Russian said at the time. &quot;It was a terrible 
                  feeling to hear the fans whistle and boo me on the court. <br>
                  &quot;I didn't throw the match on purpose, I was trying my best, 
                  chasing every ball, fighting for every point. I have had enough,&quot; 
                  he added. <br>
                  &quot;I wanted to quit right there. I couldn't bear to hear 
                  them shouting insults at me. I just couldn't take it any longer.&quot; 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Aside from the home-town expectations, Safin also has to deal 
                  with pressure from his Davis Cup team mate. <br>
                  Kafelnikov, who has said on numerous occasions that he will 
                  retire at the end of the year, desperately wants to bring Russia 
                  their first Davis Cup title. <br>
                  &quot;He keeps telling me all the time: 'I want to retire, I 
                  want to quit, let's go and win it this year',&quot; Safin said. 
                  <br>
                  &quot;Of course, I want to win it for him but it gives you so 
                  much extra pressure that can harm you at the last minute.&quot; 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  FRENCH FAVORITES <br>
                  <br>
                  Safin said the French team were heavy favorites to retain their 
                  Davis Cup title in the final, to be played in Paris or Marseille 
                  from November 29 to December 1. <br>
                  &quot;I know how strong the French team is, especially on their 
                  home court,&quot; he said. &quot;They have so many great players, 
                  so many weapons, they can play on all surfaces, hard, soft, 
                  they can play on clay or really fast surfaces, they can even 
                  play on grass.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;They will also have huge support from the home crowd,&quot; 
                  he added. &quot;But it's easier to overcome because you know 
                  it in advance, you expect the French crowd to cheer against 
                  you. It's much tougher to have the home crowd turning against 
                  you.&quot; <br>
                  <br>
                  Twice in the mid-1990s, Russia reached the Davis Cup final only 
                  to lose both times on home turf in Moscow, first to Sweden in 
                  1994 and the following year to the United States. <br>
                  Partly because of that, Safin said, he was looking forward to 
                  playing the French away from home. <br>
                  &quot;Of course, it would have been easier for us to play them 
                  here in Moscow but because of all this pressure I would rather 
                  face them in Paris, Marseille, anywhere,&quot; he said. <br>
                  &quot;And you can count on me to give it my best. It will be 
                  awfully difficult for us to win but we'll give it a try.&quot;
