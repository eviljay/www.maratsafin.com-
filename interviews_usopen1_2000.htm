                    <b>THE MODERATOR:</b> Questions.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Well, were you ready in the second set there? You 
                    hit some pretty wild stuff. <br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: </b>So what you want me to say? That first of 
                    all, it's first round. I didn't play like for ten days, since 
                    final of Indianapolis. So you come to also the big stadium, 
                    a lot of people. So it's little bit tough to start again. 
                    To play a tournament in ten days, I think it's too much. You 
                    practice, you practice, but you need to play some matches. 
                    So the first one is really tough one because you have to start 
                    to move your legs; you have to be concentrated. And today 
                    it was, this match, you have to find, even playing not your 
                    best tennis, you have to try to have this attitude on the 
                    court, just trying. Try to make the game a little bit easier. 
                    Try to put the ball inside the court. I don't have to make 
                    some winners. Just trying to play my game. I mean it's for 
                    the next match, because you start to prepare. You have to 
                    play better and better. So try to put the ball inside, try 
                    to make something new, open angles, better play tactically. 
                    Sometimes, of course, you lose your concentration, what happened 
                    in the second set. Because, of course, after ten days, it's 
                    a little bit tough to be 100 percent on the court and actually 
                    especially against this guy because he makes unbelievable 
                    winners. Sometimes he miss the balls, I mean easy balls. So 
                    it's a little bit tough to be there because you don't know 
                    what's gonna come on next shot. Also, I'm glad that I made 
                    it. I won the next two sets 6-4, 6-4. Not playing my best 
                    tennis, but I was there. I tried to hold. He had some opportunities. 
                    I just played. Even the percentage was very low, but I make 
                    23, 24 aces, so not so bad. And actually I try to put the 
                    ball inside the court, but sometimes I miss very easy shots. 
                    So now I have -- I know where I have to work on the court 
                    now for the next match.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>It looked like you had a little bit of trouble getting 
                    his serve back in the first set. Was there a kind of spin 
                    on the ball or something? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> In the third?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> In the first set. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> First? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Yes.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>It was a problem in all sets I think. 
                    But actually I didn't serve -- I don't know -- just is difficult 
                    to serve. It's very, you know -- you mean return the serve? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Returning the serve. <br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> Oh, returning. I have this problem already 
                    three weeks against Guga especially, happened in the final 
                    of Indianapolis. I had so many opportunities on the second 
                    serve, and I couldn't put the ball inside the court and try 
                    to make the point. Because I missed all the time. So I have 
                    to focus a little bit more on the second serve, return. You 
                    have to -- you don't have to put you under pressure, also. 
                    Because always when you think, "Oh, second serve, I don't 
                    know how to return," also you don't have to think this way. 
                    You just have to think what you have to do and try to make 
                    it. And one day it will come. Because it's not a question 
                    of five minutes; it's a question of days. And I hope if I 
                    will start this way just to say to myself, "Okay, let's put 
                    inside -- the ball inside the court, try to hit it because 
                    otherwise it's just pushing the ball, is no chance. Because 
                    it's flying very far." So you have to hit it. But I cannot 
                    -- is difficult to convince yourself, because you -- I was 
                    a little bit scared today returning second serve, because 
                    I wanted to make a break and so I was a little bit under pressure.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Was it the --<br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> Was a mistake. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Was it the US Open? Did it kind of get to you a 
                    little bit? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Of course. It's a big opportunity to -- 
                    not to win, but, yes, actually, I want to win it. (Laughing.) 
                    But the question is first match, you want to pass through 
                    it. If you pass first round, you gonna be dangerous. So I 
                    try to find my game, but I was a little bit under pressure. 
                    Little bit too much. You don't have to put yourself so tight 
                    because the game, it will come. It's a question of two, three 
                    days, nothing more. Two matches, and everything gonna come. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Your first-serve percentage today was very low. 
                    Have you done any self-analysis of why; are you letting the 
                    ball drop too much, overhitting it? What do you think? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>I think when I -- I rush. Sometimes I 
                    rush too much. You know, I come, I serve, second serve, boom, 
                    boom, double-fault. You have to come, you have to stand, bam, 
                    bam, bam, bounce the balls, enough to think about the movement 
                    and just think. But sometimes I forget about this. But when 
                    I hear, "Yea, Marat," it's already Love-40. Sometimes it's 
                    too late to remind yourself you have to throw the ball a little 
                    bit higher, relax, take it easy. But sometimes I thought about 
                    this when it was 15-40, Love-40, so I have to be a little 
                    bit clever. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> There's a lot of talk about you and other players 
                    being the next generation of tennis. Do you enjoy being part 
                    of that push, and do you like the attention, or is that added 
                    pressure?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Is not the pressure, it's very nice from 
                    the part of ATP Tour just to make -- to promote us. Because 
                    I think we are the future of tennis. I think Ferrero, Guga, 
                    Hewitt, a lot of guys there. We will be there in two, three 
                    years. Sampras and Andre, they not gonna play forever, right? 
                    So somebody has to take their places. Everybody wants to do 
                    it. Everybody from the new generation, New Balls Please, we 
                    want to be there. So it's very nice that they took it, everything 
                    serious. I mean the new guys. It's very nice from their part. 
                    But it's just a name. Now you have to show who you are, what 
                    you can do, and what you want also for yourself. Because it's 
                    just a name, is nothing special. You not a millionaire because 
                    your name is in New Balls Please, so you have to show that 
                    you are these kind of guys who will be in two or three years 
                    No. 1 in the world.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> When you become emotional on the court, does it 
                    help you or it hurts you? What do you say to yourself? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Sometimes it helps me a lot. Sometimes 
                    no. But I can't play -- I can't play very quiet. I have to 
                    -- because otherwise it's coming like -- it's coming, you 
                    missing, every time you say to yourself, "Don't worry, don't 
                    worry," but when you miss the tenth ball in a row, I cannot 
                    handle it.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> What do you say to yourself? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>That I'm a very nice guy. (Laughing.) 
                    If you do it one more time... (Laughing.) No. I just want 
                    to, I don't know, I need to shout or I need to throw the racquet. 
                    Otherwise, it's difficult to play because you get very nervous 
                    each time. So you throw the racquet, you shout, you say to 
                    yourself, "Come on, let's play a little bit tennis," then 
                    you start to -- you become relaxed, a little bit more relaxed, 
                    and you can play tennis. Sometimes it works; sometimes no. 
                    But normally it works. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> How many coaches out there who are looking to associate 
                    themselves with a rising star have approached you trying to 
                    get you to employ them as your coach?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I don't know. I don't -- I'm not interested 
                    for the moment in the coach because -- <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>I know you're not interested in a coach. But how 
                    many are bothering you or on the -- <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No, no. Because everybody is not coming 
                    to you and say, "If you want, I'm here, just give me a call 
                    when you need me." I never heard this. I know the circle of 
                    people, you know, who wants to work, who needs a job so I 
                    will make a choice. Not them. But I know if I will come, I 
                    have to choose. They don't have to come. I mean I know who 
                    is there, who is not there because I mean -- I don't know. 
                    They're not bothering me at all. I'm very satisfied that the 
                    people, they don't want -- they're not putting pressure, "Just 
                    work with me, I'll make you No. 1 in the world," or, "Come 
                    with me, I'll make you the best." It's very nice. They don't 
                    come and they don't bother me. It's good.<br>

                    <b>Q.</b> How many racquets do you bring with you to the court 
                    on any given match? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Six. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Six. Is that more than most other players?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I don't know. I think I have -- I think 
                    I'm the only guy who coming out with six racquets. Normally 
                    people, they have more. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> When you left the court today, were all six racquets 
                    intact?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Unfortunately, no. (Laughter.) <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>How many were intact? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Five. (Laughter.) I make the present for 
                    the people. <br>
