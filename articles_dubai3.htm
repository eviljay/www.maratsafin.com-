                    <br>
                    DUBAI, United Arab Emirates<br>
                    <br>
                    Juan Carlos Ferrero won the Dubai Duty Free Men's Open on 
                    Saturday when top seed Marat Safin was forced to retire with 
                    a back injury in the second set. <br>
                    The Russian, who pulled out when trailing 6-2 3-1, had suffered 
                    a pulled back muscle during his semi-final victory over Thomas 
                    Johansson, and he was clearly still feeling the effects as 
                    he tried to compete with Ferrero. Safin dropped his serve 
                    in the opening game, and although he was able to rally quite 
                    effectively from the baseline he lacked any weapon to upset 
                    the Spaniard. <br>
                    <br>
                    Seventh seeded Ferrero broke serve again to lead 5-2, and 
                    then kept the pressure on in the second set, holding three 
                    break points in the first game before finally breaking serve 
                    to lead 2-1. Ferrero then held<br>
                    serve in the next game, and after Safin lost the first point 
                    on his serve at 1-3 he called for the trainer but retired 
                    from the match without receiving treatment. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;I want to thank all the people for coming to the final 
                    and I'm really sorry what happened to me,&quot; said Safin.<br>
                    &quot;I'm sorry they bought a ticket and only had half a match, 
                    but these things happen and I was unlucky. Definitely I couldn't 
                    play 100 per cent. I didn't feel I could do anything with 
                    him. The way I played today, if you're not serving well you 
                    don't have enough confidence to play from the baseline and 
                    you start to miss.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    Despite his disappointment, Safin is determined to return 
                    to Dubai next year, saying, &quot;I'm very happy playing here 
                    and very happy with the people. They're very friendly and 
                    I was really impressed with the hostesses and the security 
                    guys, the drivers. Everybody was really nice and I would like 
                    to come next year.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    Ferrero said it was difficult to play Safin, despite the injury. 
                    <br>
                    &quot;I knew he was injured and he couldn't serve, but I still 
                    had to play at the same level all the time because he can 
                    play from the baseline. I had to play at a good level. But 
                    it was easier to receive his service because when he is normal 
                    he serves 190 kph and it is difficult to receive.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    Ferrero, who walked in the footsteps of Dubai Duty Free Men's 
                    Open 2000 champion Nicolas Kiefer by winning the tournament 
                    a year after finishing as runner-up, received a cheque for 
                    $167,000, while Safin received $88,000. In addition, Ferrero 
                    received a magnificent silver Dhow trophy, presented by HH 
                    Sheikh Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum, President Department of 
                    Civil Aviation, Dubai and Chairman of Emirates. <br>
