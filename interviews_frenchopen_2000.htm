                  <p><font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
                    <b>Q.</b> In that final game when you missed the first two 
                    backhands down the line, was he getting into your head a bit 
                    at that point? Were you mentally disturbed by those two errors?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No, because first of all, I mean, I start 
                    3-Love up in the first set. I start to play not right. Yeah, 
                    it was 3-Love, but it wasn't right tactic, it wasn't right 
                    game I had to play. It was 3-Love, I made some good shots. 
                    But then it was 6-4. Second set I played horrible. First two 
                    sets actually I played, I don't know, maybe my worst game. 
                    I missed every ball. I couldn't play tennis. Everything was 
                    going to the net. Nothing was under control. Of course, these 
                    last two balls in the net, it's the same. My head, in the 
                    first two sets, I was stupid. I played like really like shit. 
                    I'm not afraid of this. That's true. I play like this because 
                    I was scared, I didn't know what to do on the court. I had 
                    eye like this big (indicating large). I couldn't play tennis. 
                    That's it. The last two balls, I make him present for Christmas. 
                    That's it.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> When you're on the court, you're very open with 
                    your expressions. Have you always been like this and does 
                    it help you?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> You start to know me very well, huh (laughter)? 
                    I'm very sorry for my attitude on the court because I know 
                    it wasn't so nice from my part, to the person, to the crowd. 
                    It was too much. But I think that they have to understand 
                    it. I hope they will understand it. When the things are going 
                    in the wrong direction, completely wrong, you have nothing 
                    under control, everything you're playing, everything you're 
                    doing is completely wrong. You cannot do anything to change 
                    it. You get -- I get very pissed at myself. I say to myself, 
                    "I cannot be so stupid to play like this." I was sorry, I 
                    break three racquets. At least it helps me to win one set, 
                    so I think it's not so bad (laughter).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> The crowd seemed to enjoy it, actually. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I hope so. Otherwise, I'm really sorry. 
                    I cannot say. Sorry, that's it.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Have you always been this way? Do you remember when 
                    you were younger, you were expressive with your emotions?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, last year I was very expression, 
                    48 racquets in a year (laughter).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> I meant when you were a child.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I had not a contract, so I couldn't break 
                    so many racquets.<br>
                    <b>Q.</b> How many racquets last year?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> 48, unfortunately.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>You were talking about how many racquets today. 
                    Was it three, four, five racquets?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN</b>: (Indicating three.)<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> You took the head off of one.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Of course, if there is some persons, like 
                    Enqvist, like Norman, these kind of person, they're very quiet 
                    on the court, they can handle it. But there's some other person 
                    like me, like Ivanisevic, all the guys who play with prestige, 
                    look at them. Arazi, el Aynaoui, me, Ivanisevic, they're completely 
                    crazy (laughter). If you ask Goran how many racquets he broke, 
                    I think it's almost the same. At least for me, to me it helps 
                    a lot. I mean, is not the point to break every match three 
                    or four racquets. But today I was really pissed. Sorry, really. 
                    I'll not do it again.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> After you broke that racquet, after the second set, 
                    you seemed to play really well after that for at least a set 
                    or so.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Thank you.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Did you get it out of your system?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, it helps me. But first racquet I 
                    broke because of the floor. I didn't throw so hard. It just 
                    go (indicating). Second, I broke it because I need it. I need 
                    it because so many energy was inside of me that, I don't know, 
                    I would kill somebody - but it was the racquet. Yeah, I start 
                    to play better because I everything was gone and I start to 
                    think. But, of course, it was too late. I mean, two sets down. 
                    You win a third set. But I didn't serve. I didn't move him 
                    at all. I missed easy balls. How you can beat the guy? There's 
                    no chance. There's no chance. If I would win today, I think 
                    it wasn't right for sure, definitely, because he played much 
                    better than me. It was one guy on the court actually. I don't 
                    know how he lost the third set. Maybe out of concentration 
                    he lost his head a little bit. I was a little bit lucky. But 
                    must be very easy, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2. I didn't make anything today. 
                    Completely I was just playing -- I didn't know what to do.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> How do you explain that you played so bad, as you 
                    say, for the first two sets? Is it a mental consequence of 
                    all the matches you've been playing for six weeks?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>First of all, I was nervous, of course, 
                    because first time in quarterfinals, big chance to get in 
                    semis. Unfortunately, you start to think about all these things. 
                    You play against No. 1 in the world. He's a great player. 
                    You going under pressure all the time. You always put minus, 
                    minus, minus, minus, not even one plus. I'm playing good, 
                    so at least there's something. i'm no confidence, he's the 
                    No. 1 in the world, he won Rome, he made very good results, 
                    many things. I mean, like this, of course, you come to the 
                    court, I came like loser. Like this you going to play tennis? 
                    Too much minus in your head.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> What was the main difference in his game from the 
                    last time you played him in Barcelona and today?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> No, it was completely same game, completely 
                    same style. Everything was the same. But mine, if you -- I 
                    talk to Andrei, and we came to the same thing, that I'm not 
                    in very, very good shape like it was in Barcelona. I played 
                    easy. I didn't even play hard with all my power. But the feelings 
                    has gone. Something happened this week that I couldn't -- 
                    I was playing, but I couldn't -- I don't know. I didn't play 
                    easy like I played there. For me, I came to Barcelona. I played 
                    easy. For me, the tennis was - I don't know - I was serving 
                    like Ivanisevic in his best times. Serve, backhand, forehand, 
                    I do on the court whatever I want. But today, I mean, 200 
                    kilometers from the forehand, two meters out. So many unforced 
                    errors. I don't feel comfortable with my game actually.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q</b>. How annoying was that helicopter hovering over the 
                    stadium in the second set?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Really, if you want to hear, he get me 
                    very pissed. Sorry, but when he was going down, going up, 
                    even more noise. I don't know from where they came. I hope 
                    it was a television, otherwise the guy who rent helicopter, 
                    he's completely idiot. I mean, sorry, but we're playing tennis 
                    here. I think the crowd, they help me to make him leave.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> I guess your expectation now is rest, but what is 
                    the next step until Wimbledon? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> First of all, I have to relax a little 
                    bit. I need it because I played like one month and a half, 
                    every week. I make some good results. Then I go to Queen's. 
                    I will try to because I have to. Yeah, I know. If I am professional, 
                    I promise to the tournament that I will come, I have to come. 
                    It's not the point that I'm sad, I'm upset with myself, I'm 
                    playing bad, not to come. If you promise, I think if you shake 
                    the hands, you have to come, you have to do it. I think it 
                    will be right if I will come. I will try to win one match 
                    on grass. I never win one match.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> After you play Nottingham?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Guys, relax. <br>
