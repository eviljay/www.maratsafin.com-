                    <br>
                    THE MODERATOR: Questions, please. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What was going through your mind throughout the tiebreakers? 
                    How did you pull through today?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Was too difficult today. Very tough conditions. 
                    I mean, was too windy. Is difficult to play especially against 
                    a guy who is serving well. He has very good groundstrokes. 
                    It was tough. <br>
                    But I was lucky on tiebreaks. Yeah, I played well. I think 
                    the last tiebreak was perfect. I mean, I served well, except 
                    the first ball. <br>
                    I was a little bit scared, but passed through. It's good.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Looked like you really played more aggressively in that 
                    last tiebreak. You serve and volleyed, took the short balls 
                    and attacked them. Was that sort of the mindset going in?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yes, because to wait, keep staying on the baseline, 
                    wait for his mistakes, I mean, it's a little bit stupid. I 
                    decide to do something and put him under pressure because 
                    the guy was struggling a little bit with the forehand. I had 
                    to do, just to push there, try to do something. Try to go 
                    to the net, try to make serve and volley, try to change a 
                    little bit the game.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. To have to work that hard in the early rounds, get it under 
                    your belt, does that give you confidence that you can stick 
                    in there and fight it out?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I really happy that I beat this kind of guy. 
                    You know, the guy is playing great. He made some good results 
                    this year. For me it's very important. I mean, I feel more 
                    confident on the court. Yeah, my tennis is coming back. Each 
                    time I feel better and better. I think it's a good thing to 
                    have one match like this, very difficult one. You have to 
                    fight, very tough conditions. You know, you struggling a little 
                    bit. But you still there and you win. It's perfect. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You had to go through a fifth-set tiebreak last year when 
                    you beat Grosjean. Were you reflecting on that? Looking back, 
                    did that match give you some momentum?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Last year, I was lucky in the tiebreak. I mean, 
                    the guy, we stop at 4-All or 5-4, I make unbelievable three 
                    shots. It was really fast. I played well. I was with confidence. 
                    Was different story. <br>
                    Today I'm not so confident like last year, so I have to start 
                    from the beginning, from the basics, go to the basics, try 
                    to build again, try to do something, try to improve my shots, 
                    try to fight and try to be there on the match every time, 
                    do something. Because I'm not playing so great, so you have 
                    to start from the basics. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Do you think if you pushed yourself harder early in the 
                    match you could have avoided going so long?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, I tried. The guy also is serving well. 
                    The first set, I had only one breakpoint, I think. I couldn't 
                    do anything. <br>
                    The second set, yeah, I lost my opportunity. 4-2, 40-15, it 
                    was like a joke. I just lost completely my concentration. 
                    I just went out of the match. I mean, I was completely lost. 
                    It was very difficult to come back, really. It's a good thing 
                    to come back, but you have to be careful.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How hard is it for you to keep your temper in check?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I'm doing better. I didn't break any racquets 
                    today. I'm doing better. I'm improving, really. I'm trying 
                    very hard. Sometimes I'm surprised with myself, the stupid 
                    things I can do. I'm getting angry with myself. Lots of opportunities 
                    that you cannot miss, and I'm missing, missing, again, again, 
                    all the time. You have to do something. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. In Hamburg you said you and Mats had a bet going, you were 
                    going to give him $100 per racquet broken. Are you down or 
                    even now?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: He's making me this count. I'm not paying this 
                    month.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Last year when you won, especially during the second week 
                    you talked about how important it was to be cooler and calmer, 
                    not getting so mad all the time. Do you think it's going to 
                    be, for you, working into the tournament, better to maintain 
                    a little bit more of a cool head?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, I think, yeah. But also, I can't compare 
                    myself with last year. Last year I played and everything was 
                    perfect. I was playing unbelievable. I feel well, I feel comfortable 
                    on the court. It was a great feeling to play. <br>
                    But now I'm struggling. You know, it's very difficult to play. 
                    It's very difficult to fight. It's because you don't have 
                    enough confidence, you don't play great tennis, you just trying 
                    to run on the baseline, trying to make unbelievable shots, 
                    trying to do something. It's difficult. No confidence, and 
                    you're trying something, is the worst thing you can happen. 
                    Especially against a guy like Ljubicic with the wind. <br>
                    These kind of matches are very important. You can shout, throw 
                    the racquets, do whatever you want, but you have to win them. 
                    If you win these kind of matches, you going to another level, 
                    you just definitely going to play much better than next time. 
                    I mean, this kind of matches are very important. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Are there moments today when you look around and you start 
                    thinking about that match versus Pete last year and how perfect 
                    it was?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, it was too perfect - too perfect, I think. 
                    I cannot play like this all the time. It can happen once in 
                    my life - last year, long time ago. <br>
                    You cannot dream all the time with this match. This match 
                    was over. I won it last year. I'm great. Nice to play here. 
                    Life is going. I mean, you have to beat Ljubicic, you have 
                    to beat then Arazi, then you don't know who else. You have 
                    to forget about all these things and you have to play, fight, 
                    do everything is possible to win.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How is your leg? How are you physically right now?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Good, good. My leg, my knee, I had the problem 
                    in LA with my knee because it's a very hard surface, sometimes 
                    I have problems. But it's okay, I can run. I can run. I'm 
                    still there. I still can play tennis. It's good. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Has there been a point this year where you had the confidence 
                    or close to the confidence you had last year at The Open?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I start to play well in Dubai. I was playing 
                    unbelievable. Unfortunately, I start to play bad in the beginning, 
                    but then I beat Johansson in the semifinals, I beat some good 
                    players. I was getting really confident, really good shape. 
                    <br>
                    But, unfortunately, I broke myself. So, yeah, I have to miss 
                    one month and a half, four tournaments gone, Masters Series, 
                    no points. Then start to play in Rome. Too late to prepare 
                    yourself for Roland Garros. You go to grass, change the racquets. 
                    Make, okay, quarters. But still don't feel like with the confidence. 
                    It's very difficult. <br>
                    I keep trying.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Has this experience given you a better appreciation for 
                    the people who win four and five, six, 13 Grand Slams, how 
                    they are able to come back and continue to play at those levels?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Of course. It's amazing, the people like Pete, 
                    like Andre, my coach. I'm proud of it. The guy won seven Grand 
                    Slams. Each time he has to come back and try to win it again. 
                    Every time it's all the time like this. <br>
                    I think it's worth it. You know, if you come back and you 
                    try to win it, you win it again, it's an unbelievable, beautiful 
                    feeling because you have an unbelievable reason to have a 
                    huge party with your friends. You feel unbelievable. You feel 
                    just in the sky, you know, flying, beautiful. <br>
                    But that's why I'm coming here. I want to win it again because 
                    it's a really nice feeling. It's really nice especially to 
                    win, have all your friends around you on the final, semifinal, 
                    supporting you. It's not only one person who is winning, is 
                    winning the whole team, so is twice better, everybody is happy.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How has Mats helped you in your quest now to go back to 
                    the basics and build up your game again?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Playing, practicing. You cannot abuse too much 
                    with the practice. Otherwise, you can't play any more matches. 
                    You have to practice, but it's very important to win matches. 
                    Matches, you know, really bad ones, really difficult to play 
                    when you're playing bad, and you still there, you still fighting. 
                    So he's pushing me a little bit how to improve tactically. 
                    It's very important. You have to see the first two games, 
                    have to decide what to do with the guy, which parts of his 
                    technique, of his strokes are not so good. So you have to 
                    push to this point, try to be focused from the beginning, 
                    try to put him under pressure. He has to feel the pressure 
                    all the time.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. I didn't notice whether you were playing with your new 
                    frame today. How has that adjustment been? How has that affected 
                    your game?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No, it's good. I'm happy. It's really, really 
                    good one, really comfortable. Because the one I played in 
                    Wimbledon, it was a little bit stiff, so they make a little 
                    bit softer, the frame. Yeah, it's really good racquet. I think 
                    they have to paint it also. They forget. <br>
                    Q. Have your struggles this year made you question yourself 
                    or made you feel stronger about how you're handling your career?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: You cannot have doubts all the time. I'm playing, 
                    I'm not playing. I'm quitting, I'm not quitting. What I'm 
                    going to do? I'm playing tennis. Had a bad year - a horrible 
                    year, I could say. I didn't win one tournament. But still 
                    it's your job. I really enjoying. I mean, better times will 
                    come for sure. I want to win a few more Grand Slam tournaments, 
                    and it will be perfect. And I will win - otherwise I shoot 
                    myself (laughter). That's why also I'm working with Mats, 
                    because I really want to be a good player and I want to stay 
                    here and play for the spectators for another let's say five 
                    years. I want to win and I want to be big. I want to like 
                    to finish No. 1 one year, if it's possible. It would be great. 
                    You know, I want to be there. I want to be one of the best.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. One of the things you made very clear last year, you kept 
                    saying, &quot;I'm here to win this thing; I'm not here to 
                    make the semis or quarters.&quot; Do you feel exactly the 
                    same way, or because you're struggling you gear that back 
                    a little bit?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: It's a little bit different. But of course I'm 
                    here, I want to win. Also I'm not playing so great. I'm going 
                    slowly, match by match, trying to build my game, trying to 
                    get some confidence back. Yeah, of course, I want to win. 
                    Every time I go on the court, I have to win. I'm thinking 
                    about being a champion again.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How many more Grand Slams would you have to win before 
                    you would not shoot yourself?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: As many as I can. More than Mats (smiling).<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. When you walk out onto that stadium, does it give you a 
                    special feeling, a thought that maybe the magic will come 
                    back, your confidence will be there, your game will get back 
                    together again?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Of course. Of course. Every time you go, especially 
                    on center court, you know, you still remember the times that 
                    I beat here Pete Sampras, this day is going to be my game 
                    and this day I'm going to start my new, you know, life. I 
                    will get my confidence back, I will play great. I'm going 
                    to win again here. Also you expect some support from the spectators. 
                    Of course, for me it's very important. Especially when you're 
                    down and you're not playing great, you need some support definitely. 
                    Otherwise you feel alone on the court. I mean, it's tough. 
                    But if you have some great support, it's amazing. It makes 
                    a huge difference, unbelievable. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. After your first match, you said you wanted to get a tough 
                    one out of the way, really get your confidence back. Is this 
                    the tough one?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I hope is most toughest one, otherwise I don't 
                    want to suffer too much. It's really difficult. I'm getting 
                    old. <br>
