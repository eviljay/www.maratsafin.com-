                  WATCHING Marat Safin play tennis is like riding a rollercoaster 
                  in the dark: it's much more fun because you don't know what 
                  is going to happen next. Take the third set of Safin's fourth 
                  round match against Pete Sampras. Safin was set to blitz the 
                  tie at two sets to love and with all the momentum of the Trans-Siberian 
                  express. But a couple of line calls went against him, he lost 
                  touch and concentration, and what could have been a demolition 
                  turned into a derby.<br>
<br>
Take the numerous moments throughout the past fortnight when 
                    Safin has stopped a ball with his head, foot or (at least 
                    once) his backside. Take the moment in the otherwise unremarkable 
                    match against Mikhail Youzhny, when Safin casually flicked 
                    a ball into a line umpire, sparking a code violation and one 
                    of the more fearsome on-and-off-court tirades Melbourne Park 
                    has witnessed. <br>
<br>
Safin is often angry, he is sometimes out of control, but 
                    he is always entertaining. He has been alternately jeered 
                    and cheered by the crowds at the Australian Open, but he has 
                    copped a pounding from selected portions of the media. What 
                    makes the slightly moralistic criticism unleashed at him hard 
                    to bear is that Safin clearly spends a lot of his interview 
                    time (and quite a lot of his tennis time) with his tongue 
                    firmly tucked inside his cheek. <br>
<br>
&quot;I need to find the motivation, you know, against Sampras. 
                    That's why I brought so many blondes here tonight,&quot; he 
                    said after their epic. <br>
<br>
Safin ups his fans' value for money by the added extras he 
                    brings to his already deluxe edition game. He is fond of showing 
                    off his soccer skills, even at the most critical moments of 
                    a match. He sometimes produces a skip only matched by the 
                    unmatchable Andrew Ilie to step into his backhand. <br>
<br>
Of course there is a downside to Safin - the times when his 
                    tongue and his cheek refuse to associate with each other. 
                    The mist that hovers over him like a small red cloud is best 
                    exemplified by his outrage at being warned during the match 
                    against Youzhny. Safin's actions should not be excused - if, 
                    as reported, he told American umpire Norm Chryst that he was 
                    &quot;f___ed in the head&quot;. His obvious display of contempt 
                    for Chryst after the match (&quot;How can I respect him if 
                    he doesn't respect me?&quot;) also deserved condemnation. 
                    But it is worth pointing out that Safin has a history with 
                    Chryst and that - on this occasion - he looked particularly 
                    hard done by. He deserved a fine, but not a character assassination 
                    in the press. <br>
<br>
A sombre under current to the 2002 Australian Open has been 
                    talk of the growing unpopularity of tennis around the world. 
                    No Swedish media outlet sent a correspondent for this tournament 
                    despite the presence of four male Swedes, including eventual 
                    quarter-final opponents Thomas Johansson and Jonas Bjorkman. 
                    Johansson took umbrage to a poll in his homeland that did 
                    not rate a single Davis Cup squad in Sweden's top 10 sports 
                    teams of the century. Safin has said that Russian tennis is 
                    slowly gaining ground, but still no Russian media saw fit 
                    to track the likes of Safin, Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Youzhny, 
                    Elena Dementieva, Elena Likhovtseva or Anna Kournikova at 
                    Melbourne Park. Even Australian tennis feels in need of a 
                    pick-me-up, with Lleyton Hewitt and Mark Philippoussis leading 
                    a swag of disappointments this grand slam: the first since 
                    Pat Rafter retired. On Friday, Joshua Eagle and Scott Draper 
                    were named in our Davis Cup squad to face Argentina. <br>
<br>
Take Sampras and Andre Agassi out of the picture in a couple 
                    of year's time and it's easy to imagine American fans jumping 
                    ship in similar fashion to the Swedes. And this is where Safin 
                    comes in. <br>
<br>
The ATP's New Balls Please generation is promising in a tennis 
                    sense - Tommy Haas, Hewitt and Roger Federer may dominate 
                    the men's game over the next decade or so. But tennis needs 
                    more than quality competitors - it needs a shot in the arm. 
                    Safin is not Yannick Noah, and neither is he John McEnroe. 
                    But he is a little bit of both, and right now he is exactly 
                    what men's tennis needs. <br>
