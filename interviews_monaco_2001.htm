                    A. DI PASQUALE/M. Safin 6-3, 6-1<br>
                    An Interview With: MARAT SAFIN<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    THE MODERATOR: Questions for Marat, please.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Are you still bothered by your injury?<br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No, just a little bit afraid not to serve 100 
                    percent, that's it. But I don't think it was disappoint today, 
                    because I didn't think I play well enough on the baseline 
                    for some reasons. And I just trying to be better for next 
                    week. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Is it a question of training not that much, or being scared 
                    to be injured and not that you were limited on your play?<br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No, I just -- of course it wasn't -- the serve 
                    wasn't there 100 percent. It's a little bit of course after 
                    the injury you cannot play right away 100 percent. So you 
                    have to go little bit here, step by step. But today, at least 
                    on the clay court you can play little bit with top spin, with 
                    a kick serve. I couldn't do anything today. Just, I just try 
                    to play to build a game, but it was a little bit a disaster. 
                    I couldn't do anything against him. To lose 6-3, 6-1 against 
                    Di Pasquale, is not the way to play tennis. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. For someone like you whose game is so much based on energy 
                    and desire, how frustrating is this period for you when you 
                    can't play the way you want to play?<br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I think if -- there's a few things that probably 
                    I have to say to the people. Because the people, they know 
                    why I'm not playing 100 percent, what is the reasons. They 
                    know. So I think I just have to prepare myself for the next 
                    tournament, because it's already -- it's gone, cannot come 
                    back. You cannot play again one week in Monte-Carlo Open. 
                    You cannot change it. So next tournament is in Barcelona, 
                    then Rome. I try to prepare myself for Rome and Hamburg and 
                    Roland Garros. It's like you have to prepare yourself for 
                    the big tournaments, so I will be okay, I think, for Roland 
                    Garros. There's a tournament where I want to win, and I hope 
                    I will be there in perfect conditions. If I win there, it's 
                    a completely different story, because now I'm not playing 
                    well, but it's just a matter of a few matches and I get the 
                    confidence back and start again. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Is the serve the shot that is affected more by your condition?<br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Right now, probably. Because if you serve well, 
                    you use both hands. If you don't serve well, you have to build 
                    every point, you have to play every point, you have to fight 
                    every point. Of course it's difficult. So...<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You don't get free points, I mean?<br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Of course. As you can see, 6-3, 6-1, so of course 
                    I don't get free points.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You don't think that to stop, for example, for one or two 
                    weeks to solve completely your problem should be the best 
                    way for you?<br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No, the problem is it's already -- it's okay. 
                    Actually, I'm okay. But still you are afraid. I'm afraid. 
                    Is not because I'm still injured. I'm not injured anymore. 
                    But still, I'm afraid. You know, it's one bad movement, and 
                    you can go again. So with a time, one, two weeks, I need to 
                    play like this. And of course I serve much better than in 
                    Key Biscayne or Indian Wells. So it's already getting better. 
                    So next week, I serve a little bit harder, and I want to win 
                    results in the big tournaments. I want to prepare for the 
                    big tournaments, which, for me, the big tournaments is Roland 
                    Garros. Rome, Hamburg, they are big also. But I need to prepare 
                    myself for Roland Garros. That's it. I don't care what I have 
                    to do, whatever I have to do, I want to play very good there. 
                    That's it. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What is Mats saying to you at the moment about this period?<br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Last time I talked to him was two weeks ago. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. So he's not your coach anymore?<br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No -- yeah, he's my coach, but is coming to Barcelona, 
                    so we starting to work there.<br>
                    Also he has to play some tournaments, also. His agreement 
                    was a little bit different than normal.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. So who is with you here?<br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Nobody. (Inaudible name.) (Laughing.)<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Your injury started in Dubai?<br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, in Dubai. I got more injured at Indian 
                    Wells and Key Biscayne. Now I am okay.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. When you spoke to Mats two weeks ago, did he offer any 
                    advice about how best to play on the clay just to make sure 
                    your injury doesn't get affected again?<br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I'm not 500 in the world, I'm still No. 1, so 
                    it's little bit different. So I don't have to play -- I make 
                    good results. I won a few tournaments on clay, so I know.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. I was thinking, did he tell you how to conserve physically?<br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: You can't do. He doesn't have the same problem 
                    like me, so what he knows about me, what I have in my back? 
                    I need to know what I have to do and just take the time. The 
                    situation is not so bad. Health is most important thing in 
                    life.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Do you really feel 100 percent ready to play, or are you 
                    perhaps a bit worried about losing money if you don't take 
                    part in Masters Series events?<br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Again, again, again. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Do you really feel ready to play, or are you perhaps worried 
                    about losing money if you don't take part in some of the big 
                    events? Are you sort of forcing yourself to take part?<br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Not forcing myself. I have to start somewhere, 
                    no? Right? Why just I have to say, &quot;Oh, tomorrow I be 
                    okay. I think I'm completely 100 percent fixed, I'm perfect. 
                    I go to play.&quot; It's not like this. It's not for one day 
                    to another one. I think step by step, when you are to improve 
                    the thing, you have to play the tournament. Of course you 
                    will not win it the first tournament you want to play, but 
                    you play tournaments before so you get used to -- for the 
                    power, for the, you know, to build the muscle. You need to 
                    build the muscle. So you have to work out. And that's what 
                    I'm trying to do. That's why I came here, to play matches, 
                    try to win, which is very difficult, but I'm here. I'm trying 
                    to play. So next week I will be better. In Hamburg, I'll be 
                    perfect. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. And your back feels 100 percent?<br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: 100 percent.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
