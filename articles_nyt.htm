                  By Selena Roberts <br>
                  <br>
                  PARIS, June 2 - There is not a caution light or a warning signal 
                  to mark the moment when the talented Marat Safin will dissolve 
                  on the court. He does not ease into trouble as much as he plunges 
                  toward it.<br>
                  <br>
                  Sometimes, a friendly crowd can awaken Safin, a 6-foot-4 giant, 
                  before it is too late. But inside a center court filled to capacity 
                  with flag-waving Frenchmen today and across from their local 
                  hero, Fabrice Santoro, he could not find the rip cord to save 
                  himself.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin's yearlong pattern of self-destruction continued in a 
                  third-round match at the French Open in which he revived and 
                  rallied but ultimately folded, losing by 6-4, 6-4, 4-6, 0-6, 
                  6-1, in Santoro's proudest moment. <br>
                  <br>
                  Nothing could top the cheers for Santoro, though. While Santoro 
                  blew kisses to the French fans and lingered in the glory on 
                  court, the second-seeded Safin left without stopping for interviews.<br>
                  <br>
                  It wasn't like the introspective Safin. He took a $10,000 fine 
                  rather than do what comes naturally for him: vent for therapy. 
                  Perhaps he is running dry on catharsis. At no point this season 
                  has he resembled the beaming young Russian who dismantled Pete 
                  Sampras to hoist the United States Open trophy.<br>
                  Nine months ago, he promised nothing would change. No matter 
                  who wanted a piece of the 21-year-old player with the Abercrombie 
                  and Fitch looks and the personality of an advertiser's dream, 
                  Safin did not believe the attention would tinker with his normal 
                  life.<br>
                  <br>
                  Somehow, it did. He has not been the same in nine months. Just 
                  when he seemed to outgrow his tempermental behavior in September 
                  - he broke 50 rackets early last year - he started imploding 
                  again. Although his coach, Mats Wilander, slaps a $100 fine 
                  on the prodigy for every racket he cracks this year, Safin can't 
                  keep his head.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I respect Marat for what he accomplished last year, but 
                  he has to gro up as a mature person because the attitude is 
                  not quite professional,&quot; Yevgeny Kafelnikov said last week. 
                  &quot;I'm strongly hoping that he is going to change his attitude 
                  and understand that sometimes the success, what he had before, 
                  it's in the past.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  The past seems to be haunting Safin. The expectations have been 
                  crushing; his need to repeat his success has forced him to play 
                  with a bad back. Instead of taking time off, and losing out 
                  on a chunk of the $1.4 million bonus players receive for competing 
                  in the Master Series events, Safin has pushed onward. At times, 
                  he has played when he can barely launch into a serve, part of 
                  the reason for his so-so 15-13 record.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;People can criticize me and say I play for money, but 
                  if they knew what that meant and were in my situation, they 
                  would do the same thing,&quot; Safin said in Dusseldorf two 
                  weeks ago.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin grew up during a time of political transition in Russia. 
                  He was not as impoverished as many in Moscow, but he experienced 
                  the struggle of just making it through a day.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;There was nothing in the shops,&quot; Safin explained 
                  in an interview before the United States Open. &quot;It was 
                  difficult to find even good cheese. To get sugar was a big problem.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  He thinks like some Depression-era Americans. But Safin can't 
                  fully attribute his mediocre season to his inability to skip 
                  a month. Even Safin has admitted that his composure needs work. 
                  That is why he hired Wilander, who was supposed to bring him 
                  peace.<br>
                  <br>
                  Today, Safin was anything but calm. Santoro simply outlasted 
                  Safin's short fuse.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Frenchman put Safin on the run. With the ability to chase 
                  down Safin's pounding shots in the corner, Santoro stayed in 
                  the points. He waited patiently for his moment to strike, then 
                  repeatedly feathered drop shots that left Safin shaking his 
                  head.<br>
                  <br>
                  For the first two sets, Safin could not compete. He winced and 
                  snarled and huffed in disgust. But down 4-2 in the third set, 
                  staring down a humiliating straight-set exit, Safin regrouped.<br>
                  <br>
                  In a startling mental makeover as extreme as a before-and-after 
                  picture, he began crushing his groundstrokes deep against the 
                  baseline, forcing Santoro one way, then hitting the ball behind 
                  him.<br>
                  Safin ran off 10 games in a row before his state of mind hit 
                  its expiration date. Abruptly, he fell apart.<br>
                  <br>
                  With a shaky backhand into the bottom of the net during the 
                  third game of the fifth set, Safin's serve was broken. He never 
                  recovered.<br>
                  <br>
                  Maybe Kafelnikov was right. Maybe Safin hasn't matured, after 
                  all.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I don't care,&quot; Safin had said on Thursday, laughing 
                  off Kafelnikov's observations. &quot;I think it's O.K., his 
                  opinion. But in my opinion, I'm satisfied with my life. I'm 
                  satisfied with my age. Maybe my brain is a little bit less than 
                  21 years old, but I think that makes me feel good. I'm happy 
                  with this.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  His exit today idicated otherwise.<br>
