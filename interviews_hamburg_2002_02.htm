                  Tennis Masters Series Hamburg<br>
                  Press conference with MARAT SAFIN<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin versus Robredo 6:2, 4:2 (retired)<br>
                  <br>
                  Question (Q): Were you aware that there was something wrong 
                  with him during the match? <br>
                  <br>
                  A: I didn’t notice anything. He played okay in the first set. 
                  I thought he was moving well, but maybe he had some problems. 
                  For me it was a nice surprise that he retired.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: Can you sum up how this week was for you, particularly after 
                  your disappointing week in Rome?<br>
                  <br>
                  A: I’m feeling very happy and satisfied. I’m going to be the 
                  second or first in the race. So I’m well prepared for Roland 
                  Garros. I’m moving well and serving well. I have to make sure 
                  I’ll be able to do the same again there than I did here.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: Would it be something special for you to be the number 1 
                  in the race tomorrow?<br>
                  <br>
                  A: It’s nice, it’s always nice. You always work hard to get 
                  to the first spot, especially being there at the beginning of 
                  the season. I made some good results so far, I was in the finals 
                  in Australia, then the quarter finals in Miami, quarter finals 
                  in Monte Carlo and now in the finals here. It’s good. I’m not 
                  defending anything until the end of the year. I would be satisfied 
                  to do the same for the rest of the season.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: You have been to the finals here before. Is there any difference 
                  between then and now?<br>
                  <br>
                  A:No difference. I played really well two years ago, I was moving 
                  very well and I was full of confidence. Now I’m just climbing 
                  up and I try to get to the point where I was in 2000. I’m nearly 
                  there. I hope I can play much better that I did two years ago. 
                  I’m looking forward to the finals and I hope I’ll be fast and 
                  calm and make the match. That would be very nice.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: What were the biggest problems for you when you played Roger 
                  the last two matches on clay?<br>
                  <br>
                  A: The first set was very tough, it was 7:6 in the third and 
                  I was coming up after an injury, it was in Rome last year and 
                  it was my second match on clay. Then I played him again this 
                  year and I didn’t play very well, and he beat me quite easily. 
                  But it’s a different story tomorrow, it’s five sets and I have 
                  a lot of time, I can spend as many hours as I need to. I’m enjoying 
                  it to stay here and I don’t mind to stay there for five hours 
                  if I need that to beat him. I’ll be there and I will try to 
                  play my best tennis.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: You were in the finals here two years ago. Are you a better 
                  player now than you were then?<br>
                  <br>
                  A: Of course. You learn more things with time, you improve your 
                  game. I serve better now, I think this week I served really 
                  well. There is definitely more experience in my back.<br>
                  <br>
                  A: Marat, how did you come to team up with Amit Naoa, was it 
                  something you planned for a long time?<br>
                  <br>
                  A: Yes, for a long time. Some people think I just met him when 
                  I started to play well, but that is not true. I know this guy 
                  since I started playing at a professional level. He has been 
                  my friend for a long time, five or six years. He helped me a 
                  lot when I was down and didn’t make any result, he was with 
                  me then. At the end of last season we decided to work together. 
                  You know, he was my manager before, and he knows me quite well, 
                  he knows what I need and he’s making my life easier. I really 
                  appreciate that. He’s a really good friend and I’m happy to 
                  have him next to me. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q: Do you expect Marc to tell you a few secrets about Roger?<br>
                  <br>
                  A: I’ve also spent a few years on the tour and I know how to 
                  play against Roger, he also knows how to play against me. So 
                  there are not many secrets Marc can tell me. I think I know 
                  quite well what I have to do on the court (laughs). <br>
                  <br>
                  Q: What can you say about Roger’s weaknesses?<br>
                  <br>
                  A: I mean, if I would tell you we would be still at it tonight 
                  (laughs). There are some points, because everybody has some 
                  weaknesses and you have to push them. You have to stay with 
                  him, even if it takes five hours. You have to be strong mentally, 
                  then you definitely have your chances. If you are not able to 
                  take them, then you have a problem. But I think I’m playing 
                  good enough to beat him. <br>
