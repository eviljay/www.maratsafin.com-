                  An Interview With: MARAT SAFIN<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  THE MODERATOR: First question for Marat, please.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. What was the trouble you were having with the feet? Is it 
                  a new problem, or...?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: No, it was just a blister that was ?? had to take 
                  care of it. In the match it starts to bother me. I couldn't 
                  slide. Because when I was stepping my foot, it was a little 
                  bit bothering me. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. You were one of the young guys on the tour, but you're an 
                  old guy now in the next round. In the women's game we've seen 
                  lots of girls coming in at 15, 16 years old. But a guy coming 
                  in at 15 is very rare, isn't it?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, it's... I mean, I was a newcomer just, for 
                  me, it was like few years ago. But that's already like five 
                  years ago, four years ago.<br>
                  And I'm already, you know, fourth year on the tour. To play 
                  the new guy, it's something new for me, especially when he's 
                  15 years old. <br>
                  I think he's great player. You don't have to look at the age 
                  anymore, because everybody can play tennis. Everybody can beat 
                  anybody. And he showed that he can play tennis. He beat Voinea, 
                  he beat Davydenko, guys that are already Top 100. He beat them 
                  in two sets. And in the first match in the main draw he beat 
                  Squillari, which is a tough opponent. He beat him in three sets. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Did you see him playing?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. He has very good timing, you know. Great 
                  shots. But, you know, also if ?? I have to play against him 
                  tomorrow, so anyway I know how to play also and I am little 
                  bit ?? I have more experience than him. I would say that I would 
                  have to win so I would have to find, you know, weak points of 
                  his game. So I find out tomorrow.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. What about your own game at the moment, how do you feel? 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Today, except the first set and a half, which is 
                  just I couldn't find my game. Of course it's very difficult 
                  to play at 10 o'clock in the morning, which is, for me, it's 
                  very unusual. And especially against an opponent like Tommy 
                  Robredo. He's also young, he wants to play, he wants to win, 
                  and he's very motivated. Just I couldn't find. He start very 
                  well, very fast. Then I just changed in the second set. <br>
                  Middle of second set I start to do something new, just hitting 
                  the ball and try to move him around the court, which I cannot 
                  do it in the first set. I was probably still sleeping or I was 
                  too late... on rally I was too late. I had no time. I was running 
                  all over the place. <br>
                  Then I start to play a little bit open angles, just open the 
                  court, play a little bit more smart first set. Then it was ?? 
                  eventually score was 6-3, 6-2.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Was it a blister on your foot or something...?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: No, blister. Was blister. It's very usual for players. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Given how much time you've spent on clay, you won a Grand 
                  Slam title on hardcourts, you must think that you have a great 
                  chance at Roland Garros if you get on a roll, yeah?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but also you have to see that Monte-Carlo 
                  tournament is really, really ?? is very soon, you know. I mean 
                  it's just right after Miami, and you have no chance to prepare 
                  yourself. Especially for me. I'm more hardcourt player than 
                  clay at the moment. And for me it's difficult to change. It 
                  takes very long time. It's like two, three weeks that I need 
                  to work every day and play a few tournaments.<br>
                  But opportunity that we have is to play Estoril or Casablanca, 
                  then fly here and just play straightaway the tournament in Monte?Carlo 
                  which for me is very difficult. I cannot manage it. So that's 
                  why I lost four times in a row here and I couldn't win a set. 
                  <br>
                  And today just I was happy. I was lucky that I won. Now at least 
                  I have ?? I have confidence and I'm confident enough to move 
                  on and try to think I could win this tournament. Because I am 
                  satisfied with my second and third set.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Do you think that Gasquet could be a little shy to play against 
                  a player like you? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Not anymore. I mean, the Juniors, and I know myself 
                  also when I played the first time Roland Garros when I qualified, 
                  I didn't really care because you have nothing to lose actually. 
                  <br>
                  You're not, you know ?? he's playing in France basically. His 
                  people support him. He's in good shape. He has nothing to lose. 
                  He's just playing his matches. He's play relaxed, is like in 
                  practice. Everything is going inside, you know, whatever comes. 
                  He's hitting the ball hard. Of course it's not so difficult, 
                  you know...<br>
                  But let's see if he can make it after something else, after 
                  this tournament, you know, not just one tournament. And then 
                  it's long way to go still. So...<br>
                  But I think has great potential, great tennis, which is I'm 
                  sure that he will manage to, you know, get inside of Top 100. 
                  And after we'll see. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Sorry if this was asked earlier, but have you actually seen 
                  him play, watched him play?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, I watched him. I really like his game I think. 
                  It's really nice ? one?hand backhand, great serve for 15 years 
                  old. You know, because many people, they don't have really good 
                  serve because they still growing and it's difficult to ?? you 
                  have to correct the technique and everything. He's hitting the 
                  serve very well. Great timing, I mean, with his shots. Just 
                  he knows the game pretty well at the time. I'm surprised. He 
                  is 15 and he knows how to play. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Have you ever seen a 15?year?old as good as he is now at 
                  this stage, or apparently as good at this stage?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I don't think so. Is long time that ?? since, I 
                  don't know, who was the last one who made in Top 100 just playing 
                  big tournaments when he was 16 years old? I don't know who it 
                  was. Maybe I know from Russians, Medvedev. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Maybe Chang. <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Chang maybe. But we are talking about in '88, '87. 
                  Now is 2002. Everything is much faster, and it's really difficult 
                  to adapt yourself to the level that we are playing. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Like you, he was coached by his parents. They are tennis 
                  teachers. You had your mother. Since the age of 4, he's been 
                  taught by his father and mother who are both tennis teachers. 
                  So that's obviously a big help, isn't it, to have that sort 
                  of environment? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yes. Especially also, I mean, he grew up in France. 
                  It's a big advantage. Tennis in France is great. You have great 
                  ?? also great coaches, and everybody's playing more or less 
                  similar, you know? Doesn't ?? it's great. You have great teachers 
                  I think here, great technique. And very talented players, actually: 
                  Grosjean, Clement, Escude, Pioline. Is beautiful tennis. He's 
                  more or less same as Pioline, one?handed backhand. Just great.<br>
                  So I think the parents, they are also very good coaches. And 
                  of course it helps. Of course.<br>
                  But it never worked until, I don't know ?? it work until you 
                  are 15, 16 maximum. Then you have to change. Then you have to 
                  take a coach because you stop to respect the parents because 
                  the parents, they have to stay parents and the coach is a coach. 
                  So you have to separate these two things. <br>
                  <br>
                  Q. You were saying earlier it takes you quite a while to get 
                  used to the clay again each year. In previous years really you 
                  haven't been ready by the time you came here. Do you think the 
                  way you came to this match today has gotten you over the hump 
                  this time? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but also I played Davis Cup. But it was indoor 
                  clay, so it's not the same like outdoor clay, but still it's 
                  more or less you have to adapt your game to clay a little bit.<br>
                  hen I played Estoril, I won two rounds. I played my matches, 
                  was great. At least I had ?? I played three matches already 
                  on clay. So it helps. Of course it helps. Definitely you need 
                  to play a few matches before such big event. <br>
