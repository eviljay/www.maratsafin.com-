                  November 2001<br>
                  by Denise <br>
                  <br>
                  Well the tennis year of 2001 for Marat is over. Sad for us his 
                  fans as we love to watch him and always want his playing to 
                  go on and on. But for Marat it was best. The season was not 
                  good - there were injuries and he did make some crazy decisions 
                  to play on because of Bonuses but we all have to learn by experience 
                  and I guess he learned that this year. Why do people think you 
                  are whining when you make an honest statement? Seems honesty 
                  is not always appreciated by the blood sucking media – after 
                  all what are they going to use to sell their articles?<br>
                  <br>
                  So what can I reflect on what I have seen this year? <br>
                  <br>
                  First of all Paris. Well to tell you the honest truth - to take 
                  a leaf out of Marat’s book – the season is too long. My general 
                  impression was that the majority of the players were really 
                  tired. They looked it and the results speak for themselves. 
                  How often do you find so many top seeded players going out so 
                  early? And for some the season is not over yet. Masters Cup 
                  still to come and for some - French and Australian – Davis Cup 
                  Final. How fresh is Lleyton Hewitt going to be in January? I 
                  believe he is playing Hopman Cup this year and then will he 
                  defend his title in Sydney? Could he be a casualty next year 
                  the way Marat was this year? Then I know Grosjean was thrilled 
                  to make the Masters Cup – but how tired will he be for Davis 
                  Cup Final? Will France think he is so great if he fails at the 
                  Davis Cup because he is overtired? He is their darling now having 
                  been the first Frenchman to win Paris since 1991. <br>
                  These are just a couple of players – as Sjeng Schalken said 
                  – I am glad the season is over – now I can take my vacation. 
                  We know Marat’s words – I was dead out there and he was. He 
                  said himself “ I never played such BAD tennis.” The court didn’t 
                  help – three times this year he has been insulted by the organisers 
                  (that I know of) – Wimbledon the reference to “thankyou that 
                  I should finally get to Centre Court to play Goran” – US Open 
                  the defending champion doesn’t get to play on Centre Court – 
                  gets sidelined to smaller courts and then Bercy – Court 1 was 
                  a disaster for the players – for the small amount of public 
                  that could get in it was great being so close but how come the 
                  defending champion played on this court. So he wasn’t in the 
                  best of shape and hadn’t had a great season but I don’t ever 
                  remember seeing Agassi or Sampras treated that way. Court 1 
                  – a converted icerink was cold, dark, and the surface was totally 
                  different to Centre Court. The funny thing was on the Thursday 
                  of the match Marat left for practice at 12.30 with Mats – we 
                  left for the stadium to make sure we got seats in Court 1 and 
                  apparently 10 minutes after we left Marat was back. Did that 
                  mean he didn’t get to practice on Court 1 – but Guga was practicing 
                  there when we arrived. Seemed an awful lot of bias if you ask 
                  me. What has Marat done to deserve all this? In the eyes of 
                  his fans he is fantastic – he is good to them and always takes 
                  the time when asked for photos, autographs whatever – others 
                  couldn’t be bothered and I have seen them and they are well 
                  known top players too. But somehow his PR is lacking when it 
                  comes to the tournament organizers. This is something he needs 
                  to address – the time has come for him to actually ensure that 
                  he has a permanent PR – Managers and Management groups are not 
                  trained in this aspect and although Marat is excellent at PR 
                  himself he doesn’t have time to organize all the little details 
                  himself. So when he talks about organizing the year ahead I 
                  hope that is one aspect he will address.<br>
                  <br>
                  So back to my relections. Paris is a great city despite the 
                  fact that I suffered an amazing theft of the racquet – seems 
                  France has a problem these days – namely Marat’s loss in Lyon. 
                  Seems he was not alone even the President of France was robbed 
                  in Lyon. Bercy is a great stadium but could do with a big clean 
                  up. The restaurants and pavement bistros are great. The hotels 
                  are very near to the stadium which makes it easy to get to the 
                  tournament. It was great going to the Players Hotel and meeting 
                  lots of other fans – ones that couldn’t afford to go to the 
                  tennis but were prepared to stand outside for hours just to 
                  see Marat and take a photo with him. I loved meeting all the 
                  fans and that has been a wonderful part of all the tourneys 
                  I have attended this year. I have learned to recognize how Marat 
                  operates – he is definitely not a “morning” person – before 
                  twelve noon he is not very with it! He loves good clothes for 
                  those who are interested and these details are courtesy of Ilaria 
                  who is very observant – when Marat left in that beautiful Mercedes 
                  dark blue (azurite blue I believe is the correct term) he was 
                  wearing the following : dark blue T Shirt, black V necked sweater, 
                  Lovely soft black leather jacket – nappa leather – obviously 
                  a favourite as it was well worn - black Boss Jeans, black Prada 
                  shoes and went he bent over the boot to kindly get the pass 
                  for the fan who asked – grey Calvin Klein underwear! So now 
                  you know. Very good taste and something I have definitely noticed 
                  along the way at all the tourneys I have seen this year.<br>
                  <br>
                  And so I saw Marat in Dubai – a very big thrill as my first, 
                  at Queens, Wimbledon, LA, Indianapolis (probably my favourite 
                  as I got to go in the lounge where the players ate and saw Marat 
                  so close) then Stuttgart where I stayed at the players hotel 
                  and that was a great thrill even though I only saw Marat briefly 
                  and Paris where I saw Marat and his car and being so casual 
                  and so good to his fans. And above all I met so many wonderful 
                  fans and made a lot of new friends and that has been the best 
                  part – we come from all over the world but we have one thing 
                  in common - Marat Safin – long may it continue.<br>
                  <br>
                  So to 2002 – where will I go to? I don’t know at this moment 
                  but have requests to be at Rome and Monte Carlo and Roland Garros 
                  and Indian Wells and Indianapolis again and I want to go back 
                  to Dubai and to Bercy and will Stuttgart still have the Masters 
                  next year or will it go to Madrid? Whatever or wherever I see 
                  him play again – I know that Marat will give me the thrill that 
                  he always does. It has been a joy watching you Marat and one 
                  I hope to continue enjoying for a long long time! <br>
