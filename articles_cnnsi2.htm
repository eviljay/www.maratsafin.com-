                    Russian wants to reassert himself in Paris</b><br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    DUSSELDORF, Germany (Reuters) -- The towering man with the 
                    wild eyes and thick wavy hair, who just moments before had 
                    been screaming in Russian and flinging his racquet into the 
                    clay on missed points, had regained his composure. <br>
                    <br>
                    Marat Safin, the U.S. Open champion whose 2001 season has 
                    been marred by injuries, was a different man as he spoke in 
                    a voice barely above a whisper after his win over Franco Squillari 
                    at the World Team Cup. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;I'm getting older and more clever,&quot; said the 21-year-old 
                    Russian as he contemplated his chances at next week's French 
                    Open. &quot;It's very important for me to win something.&quot; 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;I've had two good matches here this week,&quot; he said, 
                    referring to his win over Argentine Squillari on Thursday 
                    as well as his straight-sets win over former world No. 1 Pete 
                    Sampras. &quot;I will be ready for the French Open. I think 
                    I'm prepared.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    And despite his soft-spoken demeanor in interviews, when he 
                    went out on the court in Dusseldorf there was still plenty 
                    of fire in Safin.<br>
                    <br>
                    He was given three code violations and docked points in a 
                    loss to Frenchman Sebastien Grosjean.<br>
                    <br>
                    Upset at some controversial umpiring calls, he first hit a 
                    ball into the nearby forest then destroyed his racket, and 
                    later hit the referee's chair with another racket. <br>
                    <br>
                    Safin later said the American referee, Norm Chryst, had &quot;something 
                    against Russians.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    The Russian was born in Moscow but moved to Spain as a teenager 
                    to perfect his game in a warmer climate. <br>
                    <br>
                    He was the surprise of 2000, his seven tournament wins were 
                    the most of any player and climaxed with the U.S. Open win 
                    over Pete Sampras. He topped the ATP Entry System rankings 
                    at the beginning of this year. <br>
                    <br>
                    But elbow and back ailment injuries have made 2001 a struggle 
                    for him and he reached only one final -- in Dubai, where he 
                    lost to Juan Carlos Ferrero -- before the back injury sidelined 
                    him. <br>
                    <br>
                    He was beaten in his opening matches in three Masters Series 
                    events and last week was knocked out of a fourth at Hamburg 
                    in the second round. <br>
                    <br>
                    Safin is still second in the ATP Entry System, but has slipped 
                    to 30th in the Champions Race, which is based on 2001 results. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Last year I was beating everyone,&quot; said Safin. 
                    &quot;I was like 'Marat Safin, this rising young Russian star' 
                    who could beat everyone. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;This year has been difficult. The back problem took 
                    a lot longer than I thought. I was playing great and then 
                    this.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    And even when he returned, he found his opponents were raising 
                    their game against him. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;I've noticed they are all playing great tennis against 
                    me,&quot; Safin said. &quot;Or maybe I make them play great.&quot; 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Safin knows how satisfying it can be for a young player to 
                    upset someone from the top of the rankings. He reached the 
                    fourth round of the French Open in 1998, beating Andre Agassi 
                    en route.<br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;I know what it's like -- it's a double motivation for 
                    them to beat me,&quot; he said. <br>
                    <br>
                    He said that his understanding of the game he has played almost 
                    his whole life -- his father is a tennis instructor -- has 
                    grown recently since he hired Mats Wilander, who won seven 
                    Grand Slam titles in his career, as his coach.<br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Mats has helped me learn about how to win, how to be 
                    clever,&quot; Safin said. &quot;People would ask me 'How did 
                    you beat Pete Sampras at the U.S. Open' and I would say 'I 
                    don't know. I just beat him'. I didn't realize 'how.' <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;But now with Mats, I have learned more about 'how' to 
                    beat people. I have learned to be more clever.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    Safin said he has enjoyed working with the stoic Swede. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;Mats doesn't really say a lot,&quot; Safin said. &quot;I 
                    don't need someone telling me what to do all the time. I don't 
                    like it when coaches talk to much, try to teach you too much. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;If they talk to you from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. it drives 
                    you crazy. The guy lets me do what I want to do.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    Despite his patchy performances this season, Safin believes 
                    he can justify his number two seeding at Roland Garros. <br>
                    <br>
                    He said he feels fit and is glad some people view him as an 
                    outsider now. <br>
                    <br>
                    &quot;There's no pressure on me anymore, the pressure is on 
                    them,&quot; he said. &quot;If I can get past the first two 
                    or three rounds I think I can be in the fight for the championship.&quot; 
                    <br>
