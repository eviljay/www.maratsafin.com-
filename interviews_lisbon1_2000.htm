                    Safin defeated Alex Corretja 6-7(6), 7-5, 6-3<br>
                  <br>
                    MODERATOR: Questions in English. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You spoke about nerves in Paris a few days ago. Were you 
                    nervous at the start? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I wasn't nervous, but I was a little bit angry 
                    with myself that I didn't make so stupid mistakes. I mean, 
                    I 5-3 in the first set, 5-4 serving for the set. My confidence, 
                    my concentration completely gone. Alex, he serve for the match. 
                    But then suddenly everything just changed. He just let me 
                    play a little bit more. He let me get into the match. Because 
                    he serve all the time from the second serve, so he gives me 
                    an opportunity to make him a break. Finally, satisfied with 
                    my third set after these two horrible sets. Finally I found 
                    my game. It gives me confidence, at least.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. With the fact you're reunited with your coach, how important 
                    is that and what does he bring to your game? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I think it's important for me because he knows 
                    me very well. He knows me. We know each other since 14 years 
                    old, since I was 14. He knows what I need in each moment of 
                    the match. Sometimes we get angry on each other, but it's 
                    normal. I mean, we know too good each other, so it's almost 
                    after the match it's not any problem. But in the match, when 
                    I get nervous, you have to shout on someone, so we shout on 
                    each other. We get angry in the difficult moments of the match. 
                    But I need him. I definitely need him because he support me 
                    a lot, gives me confidence. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Is he responsible for you winning or losing? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: For what? <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. If you win a match, is it because he has helped you? If 
                    you lose a match, is it because he didn't help you enough? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No, I think it's also we have to be -- we have 
                    to understand that it's anybody's fault. It's my fault because 
                    I'm losing the match, definitely. But also you need some help 
                    when you are out there. You need some not support, but to 
                    hear something new because sometimes you get lost in the match. 
                    From the side, you can see what is happening on the court. 
                    And I need it. I need someone to help me. So sometimes I get 
                    nervous because I don't receive anything. You know, I don't 
                    receive some few words that you need to know what is going 
                    wrong. Because today, as you can see, in the first two sets, 
                    something was going wrong. I didn't know what happened, so 
                    I need to, you know, show something, to tell me something, 
                    you know, to get me back to the match. But also if I lose, 
                    it's anybody's fault. First of all, it's my fault, definitely. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Who do you think is favorite next week in the Davis Cup 
                    final and why? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: With all my respect to Australian team, I mean, 
                    they have great players: Lleyton, Mark and Patrick, great 
                    doubles. But we have to understand that they going to play 
                    in Barcelona, in Spain. It's probably going to be probably 
                    10,000 Spanish people, you know, with the flags, with everything, 
                    with all the things you can imagine just for Spanish team. 
                    Also they're playing on clay. It's going to be very slow clay, 
                    so I don't think -- of course, they have chances, but the 
                    favorites for me are the Spanish team because they're playing 
                    at home, because it's going to be slow clay court. I think 
                    is enough. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You said that you only found your game in the third set. 
                    In the first two, did you feel pleased of the way things were 
                    going? Did you feel any way happy with this victory? How do 
                    you feel it, in general? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: In general, for the first day, I think it's okay. 
                    But also I'm not happy because I put in a wrong way all my 
                    game. It was a big mistake. I mean, 5-3, I was playing okay. 
                    I was doing the minimum that's possible to beat him. He just 
                    beat me first two sets, and suddenly I decide to play tennis. 
                    Already I start from the beginning, and was getting better 
                    and better and better. Finally in the third set, it was okay. 
                    But also you can realize that No. 1 cannot play like this, 
                    like second set and like first. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. It's hard to hear, so you may have been asked this question, 
                    but how much is No. 1 on your mind when you're playing these 
                    matches now? Are you thinking about it out there? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: First of all, it's responsibility. You have to 
                    be responsible because No. 1 -- I mean, it's nice to be No. 
                    1, right? At least once in your life, it's nice. But also 
                    when you're going to the court, you have to understand, you 
                    have to have in your mind that you are No. 1. You cannot do 
                    stupid things. Yes, of course, breaking racquets, shouting, 
                    it's normal. But, I mean, making so many mistakes, get lost 
                    in the match, I didn't know where to run, no serve. I mean, 
                    of course, the guy, he played very well also. I don't want 
                    to say that I didn't play at all. I was there. I fighting. 
                    I fighted there. But also I was responsible because I No. 
                    1. I have to fight. At least I have to show something to the 
                    people because they're coming here to watch the No. 1. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. I mean, how much motivation this week is the idea of finishing 
                    the year No. 1? Are you thinking about it? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Enough motivation to play, but it's tough also. 
                    I mean, everybody wants to beat you, it's normal, and you 
                    have to give all your best on the court. Of course, I would 
                    like to finish No. 1 this year. It would be great. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. By winning today, you eliminated Sampras mathematically 
                    from contention for finishing No. 1. Can you comment on that? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Sorry about that. That's life. <br>
                    <br>
