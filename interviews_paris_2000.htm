                    Safin lost his first Tennis Mastzers Series final in Paris, 
                    defeated 76(1), 6-1, 4-6, 6-4 by World No.1 Andre Agassi. 
                    Here are his thoughts after the match.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    Q.</b> What lessons did you learn from the match today?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> A lot of things that each player will take 
                    from Andre Agassi: his footwork, how he's fighting, of course 
                    the speed of the ball, it's going very fast. <br>
                    <br>
                    Also the attitude on the court. It's very difficult to play 
                    against him because you are always under pressure. If you 
                    are not 100% conditions, it's difficult to play against him. 
                    Like happens today, the first set I made a break, and it's 
                    gone so easy that you can't play like this against Andre in 
                    this moment.<br>
                    <br>
                    When you have a break, you have to stop, you have to think, 
                    play each point. If not, is going very fast and you are not 
                    under control because you start to play on his game and you 
                    are in big trouble. </font><br>

                  <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>Q</b>. 
                  The fact that you had a long, long match yesterday into the 
                  evening, was that still a problem for you when you started today?<br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think no. I think the problem was that I 
                  start to play his game: long points and I was running all the 
                  time. My game is playing very short points, but I couldn't do 
                  it. First of all, I was very nervous, my first final in Mercedes 
                  SuperU 9 , also against Andre Agassi. There is a lot of respect 
                  to him.<br>
                  <br>
                  I didn't do so badly - not so badly. I wasn't sure. You have 
                  to be sure in your conditions that you can make it. I wasn't 
                  sure, so that's why it's just gone. <br>
                  <br>
                  The first set was actually not mine, but it was a good chance 
                  to just take my serve each time and you can finish the set 6-4, 
                  7-5, whatever, it doesn't matter. <br>
                  <br>
                  This is some things that make the big difference from the players 
                  of Top 20 and the players out of Top 20, this small difference. 
                  Just important points, important games. You should stop. Just 
                  a few things I have to learn, all the players has to learn, 
                  if you want to be on Top 20.<br>
                  <b><br>
                  Q. </b>But looking back on this week, will you regard this as 
                  a big step forward in your career, gives you the chance to take 
                  a big step forward, put it that way?<br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> No, I think just for me I come back because 
                  I was 23 in the beginning of the year, I was playing my best 
                  tennis. After the Davis Cup against Germany, it left. I couldn't 
                  fight when they start the clay court season, Barcelona, Monte-Carlo 
                  , Hamburg , Rome , everything. I couldn't play. I felt uncomfortable 
                  on the court. I felt so slow.<br>
                  <br>
                  The points, they left, and I went almost to 40. It's difficult 
                  to come back because you are losing your confidence. Each match 
                  when you're playing, when you're losing, your confidence is 
                  going each time. After, it's difficult to come back, to play 
                  your best level. <br>
                  <br>
                  I got injured after Roland Garros. I was one month and a half 
                  I couldn't play, couldn't practice also. It was difficult time 
                  for me.<br>
                  <br>
                  But now, at the end of the season, I know is too late, as I 
                  said before, but it's nice to finish the season playing really 
                  great tennis. I think for me is a good level, is good to finish 
                  like Top 25 or whatever, also playing good, so you can start 
                  the next year with all your confidence. I think it's very important 
                  for the players.<br>
                  <b><br>
                  Q.</b> What is your goal for the next season?<br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> If I start again, my goal, I would like to 
                  win all my Grand Slams (laughter) . No, okay, I want to be in 
                  Top 20. Even I don't know what can happen tomorrow. It will 
                  be nice to start the year playing good, with a confidence, and 
                  after you can see how it's going. Because if you are confident, 
                  you can play great tennis. If you play great tennis, you win 
                  matches. If you win matches, you get more confidence. It start 
                  from a small thing, going bigger, bigger, bigger. Who knows, 
                  maybe I will win another Super 9. Things are making bigger, 
                  bigger, bigger. Who knows what can happen next year. Maybe not, 
                  I don't know. But I hope so.<br>
                  <b><br>
                  Q.</b> What was your injury after the French Open ? <br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> I broke the capsule in the elbow so I couldn't 
                  take the racquet. <br>
                  <b><br>
                  Q. </b>Do you think one of the main things you can improve is 
                  consistency? It seems like last year after the French you also 
                  had a period where you had a hard time motivating; same this 
                  year. Is there anything you can do concretely to fight against 
                  these lapses?<br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yes, of course. This is a problem for all the 
                  young players, like me, Di Pasquale, Ferrero, Malisse, all these 
                  players my age. They play one week unbelievable, and after is 
                  finished for one month or something like this, then he start 
                  again playing unbelievable.<br>
                  It will come, I think. It will come next year when you get a 
                  little bit into ATP Tour, know the people inside. It's very 
                  important for us to be comfortable because when you start the 
                  career, you don't know anybody. You come just to ATP Tour, don't 
                  know anybody. You don't know the players, how they play. It's 
                  difficult.<br>
                  <br>
                  So it's difficult also to play because it's coming from the 
                  head. Of course, it's coming with the years. When you getting 
                  older, you getting better with your head because you start to 
                  understand your life. It's a little bit philosophic, I know, 
                  but it's true (laughter). It's true, that you getting clever 
                  with the years, with the time. As soon as possible is better 
                  (laughter) .<br>
                  <b><br>
                  Q.</b> You say yesterday, "I want to fight tomorrow against 
                  Andre , and I want also to enjoy the game." Did you enjoy today? 
                  <br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> When you run five times on the baseline like 
                  this, you not enjoying (laughter). You think, "When I going 
                  to finish?" You getting tired. Your face is the color of the 
                  court. The heart is going 200. I think it's a difficult moment. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Sometimes with a big shot, with a big serve, a big return, big 
                  point, of course, you are enjoy tennis.<br>
                  <br>
                  But to enjoy tennis, you have to work. If you work, you play 
                  unbelievable tennis; you can enjoy it. But when you run on the 
                  baseline, it's not nice. Also, of course, against Andre , you 
                  have to run. That's why I'm playing tennis, because I enjoy 
                  my game.<br>
                  <br>
                  It was a nice match. It's very important for us. The people 
                  enjoy it. I think they are happy. We didn't make five sets - 
                  I didn't make five sets. Still, I think it was a great week 
                  for the people because all the matches was perfect, three sets, 
                  very tight. If the people enjoy it, is enough for me. Also, 
                  I make the final, of course (laughter) . <br>
                  <b><br>
                  Q.</b> Do you know your next opponent in Moscow ?<br>
                  <br>
                  <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Do you know (laughter) ?<br>
                  <b><br>
                  Q.</b> Yes. <br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> Don't ask me this question. You know, Santoro 
                  . They call me, the director of the tournament, he told me, 
                  "Do you know who you play?"<br>
                  I said, "Who?"<br>
                  " Santoro ."<br>
                  I couldn't talk I was so disappointed because I hate to play 
                  against him, really (laughter). For me is like almost, "You 
                  going to die tomorrow. How you feel?" Same as they told me I 
                  have to play against Santoro .<br>
                  You will go out from the court without tennis, you will finish 
                  this match. You will not put one ball. You finish and you can't 
                  put one ball in or you play unbelievable. Normally is going 
                  I can't play tennis anymore against Santoro. I need two weeks 
                  to prepare. I need two weeks to practice to play the next match. 
                  Let's see. Let's see. <br>
                  <b><br>
                  Q.</b> What do you think about Russian tennis since the time 
                  of Andrei Chesnokov and the revolution in the other countries 
                  of eastern Europe from socialist countries?<br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> It's difficult to explain. The mentality of 
                  Russians, it's very strange. Actually, very strong on the court. 
                  We know what we want and we fight. In tennis, you need the head 
                  to fight. I'm talking about small kids, they are starting their 
                  career, they are playing satellites, futures, they fight. They 
                  need somebody who can explain to them what they have to do to 
                  help them to go in the right way. <br>
                  <br>
                  There are a lot of guys with a lot of talent. But the people 
                  who are with them, they don't have so much experience to show 
                  them, to learn them how they have to work, how they have to 
                  live, change a little bit of mentality. It's very important 
                  for the young players to be in the Top 100. As I said before, 
                  you have different countries like France, Spain, Italy , Germany, 
                  it's a little bit different. They need the people who can teach 
                  the small kids. It's very important.<br>
                  <br>
                  I mean, I would like to have some more players in the Top 100, 
                  small kids, young kids, because they can play well, but they 
                  need some help, some advisor to show them, to learn them how 
                  they have to live first of all, and after how they have to play 
                  tennis. It's very important if you have a close person, that 
                  you can trust her or him, doesn't matter. You will be good player. 
                  But if you don't have, it's very difficult to play tennis when 
                  you are alone. You need somebody more, of course, who can teach 
                  you how to live and how to play tennis. It's very important.<br>
                  <b><br>
                  Q.</b> You played the semifinal against Australia . How do you 
                  see the final of the Davis Cup ?<br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> I think it will be difficult, for sure. Philippoussis 
                  and Hewitt are good players. Hewitt , he can run like ten hours 
                  on the baseline. Doesn't matter; is not a problem for him.<br>
                  <br>
                  Actually, for French people, for Pioline , Grosjean , they have 
                  a lot of talent, a lot. I don't know. I don't know, it's up 
                  to you. You play in France with the crowd. I think it will help 
                  you to win the Davis Cup .<br>
                  <b><br>
                  Q.</b> Do you think they should put Santoro in singles?<br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, but I'm not playing (laughter) .<br>
                  <b><br>
                  Q.</b> Do you think clay is a good choice, to play on clay?<br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> Of course, because Mark is good player, but 
                  for indoors, for hard courts. On the clay, his serve is not 
                  so well, like here.<br>
                  Yeah, go to play with Grosjean on clay court, you will see what 
                  happen. After five sets, you can't walk anymore on the court. 
                  I think it's very good, very good choice.<br>
                  <br>
                  Pioline , he can play everywhere. He's a lot of talented. He's 
                  unbelievable. He's always going like this (hanging head down), 
                  "What am I doing here on the court?" There's a lot of talent 
                  in his body. He can play unbelievable tennis. I think France 
                  may have a good chance.<br>
                  <b><br>
                  Q.</b> (Inaudible)?<br>
                  <b><br>
                  MARAT SAFIN:</b> I remember two years ago, he played a Challenger 
                  in Ljubljana. He was playing against one guy. He slide on the 
                  court. He look at the court, "We sliding, huh?" I they he played 
                  only a few times on clay court. It was two years ago. He can 
                  play everywhere also because he's fast, very talented, he knows 
                  what he wants, he's a big fighter. It will be difficult also.
