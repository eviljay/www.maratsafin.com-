                  Here is the translation of the article taken from the French 
                  sport Newspaper &quot;L'equipe&quot;.<br>
                  translated by Matt.<br>
                  <br>
                  <i>Hi there! Here's the translation of L'équipe from yesterday. 
                  Sorry my very poor English!!<br>
                  Matt. <br>
                  </i><br>
                  At twenty years old, the talentuous Marat search his stability, 
                  between his champion's statue and his party's spirit.<br>
                  <br>
                  The Marat's Safin destiny definitely changes the 10th of September 
                  2000, day of his victory against Pete Sampras at the final of 
                  the Us Open. Until there, he's only the most hope of the tennis's 
                  world. The night after the final, he becomes a superstar of 
                  the game. &quot;Two hours after the final, I took him apart 
                  and said to him &quot;Today, you still don't know, but your 
                  life has changed&quot; He didn't want to hear about that and 
                  said &quot;No, I will never change!&quot; But I knew that he'd 
                  be in a vague which will be more stronger than him. The problem 
                  is that Marat doesn't want to be a superstar He always says 
                  me &quot;Gerald, I don't want to be Agassi or Kournikova.&quot; 
                  But he doesn't have the choice. Today he lives better the situation 
                  because he has accepted it.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin is not the first to have staged, to pass from an anonymous 
                  life to the glory. One year after his victory, in 1990, Pete 
                  Sampras was relieved to abandon his title: too much pressions 
                  and solicitations. But the American hd an advantage which permit 
                  him to do the career that we know: he doesn't have interest's 
                  centers over tennis. Not Safin. As a good Russian influenced 
                  by the Spanish culture, he likes parties, sometimes until excess. 
                  &quot;I don't know if it's because of his incredible physical, 
                  but in his personality, all is excessive, said Arnaud Casagarnde, 
                  the coach of Escude and a good friend of Marat. Whatever is 
                  his activity, I've the impression that he can't things in a 
                  half. When he does party, he completely does it. When he practices, 
                  he can works really too hardly. At the table, he can eats very 
                  very much. He's never between the two extremes.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  The dilemma would be less difficult if Marat would not have 
                  conscious of his enormous talent. But in the Atp's world, all 
                  is believed. But from Bob Brett to Marc Rosset, everybody agrees: 
                  if the guy keeps his feet at earth, he's going to dominate exclusively 
                  the tour. A failure would be an heresy , an insult for his talent. 
                  Between his pendulum of his desires, the Russian search the 
                  Stability's point. &quot;There's a sort of a conflict in himself, 
                  explains Tsobanian. On the one hand, he knows that to become 
                  the Number one, he must be concentrated on his job and more 
                  vigilant on his hygiene's life, and on the other hand, he wants 
                  to profit of the life, like all guys who are twenty years old 
                  like too. This conflict is difficult. 2001 was an adaptation's 
                  year. People found him a little bit arrogant, inaccessible, 
                  hard, less smilingly. It's more easy for him this year. He's 
                  now more focused on the Events. Between that he can becomes 
                  again the young guy that he'd like to be.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  The Safin's picture with his blondes at the last Australian 
                  Open makes the round of the world. Nothing is better to fabricate 
                  a cliché. The truth is surely more finely stunded. &quot; For 
                  me, Marat is the James Dean of the tennis. He loves life and 
                  can't refrain for profiting about it, even if it means that 
                  he burns his wings. He's got a beautiful face, he likes parties 
                  and women. But in the same time, he's not a gambler. The thing 
                  that he prefers is to be at the table with his friends, to be 
                  with with people that he appreciates. He's really nice and generous. 
                  There's fifteen days old when I went to Geneva to practice with 
                  Nico (Escudé), it's him who came to the airport. The evening, 
                  we went at the restaurant. Of course, he paid for everybody&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Best friend of Marat on the tour, coach-assistant until a new 
                  order, Marc Rosset confirmed these words. He even goes more 
                  far than Casagrande: Everybody believes that Marat likes to 
                  show off with models in the nightclubs. But the thing he hates 
                  the most, except the rules, is to go to the nightclubs and to 
                  be call out by everybody of &quot;good advice's&quot;. Like 
                  me, he's in fact very shy. Since he's in Geneva, he didn't go 
                  out a lot. He prefers stay at his apartment, quietly. When I 
                  call him, there's nine chances about ten that he's reading on 
                  his sofa. In fact, the thing that he loves is to be with three 
                  or four friends, in a room, to remake the world. He'd immediately 
                  sign to be the number one and to be in the same time unknown.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  But it's not easy to be unnoticed with an athletic physical 
                  overhung by a beautiful face, and when Marat likes to laugh, 
                  to charm his auditory. On the ATP tour, encircled by processionals 
                  with boring speeches, Safin stands out clearly by his sense 
                  of humor and derision. To a journalist who asked him in Estoril 
                  how was his stay in Moscow, he answers with a little smile &quot;The 
                  weather was good. But it's normal: in Moscow, it's me who deals 
                  with the weather.&quot; The famous &quot;Bête noire&quot; of 
                  Marat, Fabrice Santoro, is not the last to profit of his retorts:&quot; 
                  After my my fourth or fifth victory against him, whenever he 
                  saw me, he took his hands on his head and said &quot;No, please, 
                  not him!&quot;. He teases me too: &quot;So, Santoro, always 
                  there with your smile?&quot; or &quot; Tell me, it's a long 
                  time ago, that you're in the tour. Don't you believe it would 
                  be the good the time to stop now?&quot;. He's a nice guy, and 
                  I find that our matches gets closer us.<br>
                  <br>
                  Even in competition, Safin has some troubles to let the clown 
                  who is in him: &quot;I took my best crazy laugh with him, remembers 
                  Nicolas Escudé. We played a double in Rotterdam. I played with 
                  Rosset, and Marat with Kiefer. On a lob completely missed, Marc 
                  has search the difficulty in trying to do backhand smash, who 
                  finished at the deep of the net. I looked Marat, and we exploded 
                  of laugh. The problem was that it took 10 minutes to stop to 
                  laugh. It was impossible to play, so we asked &quot;Cazou&quot;(Arnaud 
                  Casagrande) to leave the court. Marat couldn't hit the ball.&quot; 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The anecdote dates from one year and a half. Now, Safin seems 
                  to let his unconcern which was so endearing. &quot;I met him 
                  the first time at the beginning of 1999 before he explodes at 
                  the high level, explains Tsobanian. It was one year before to 
                  work with him. The thing that I liked was his youth, his lightness. 
                  We noticed him, because he liked to have fun and to do the clown. 
                  That's which miss to him today. I think that he doesn't carelessness. 
                  The fact that there's a lots of money in the game, and that 
                  he feels to be observed for every facts and gestures blocks 
                  him. In private, he has kept this enjoyed personality. In public, 
                  he hides it. I think that he's got a lots of qualities that 
                  he hesitates to develop, like his charmer side, his sense of 
                  the communication. He could be more open. He has so much talent 
                  on his face, his smile and his eyes&quot;.<br>
                  <br>
                  Tsobanian shares his time between Safin and Goran Ivanisevic. 
                  We can believe that he likes to care about difficult cases: 
                  &quot; They have a few commun points. If there was someone who 
                  would come from an another planet, who would not know Marat 
                  but who would be Goran Ivanisevic, I would tell him :&quot;You 
                  see, there's a man who looks like you!&quot; It depends of his 
                  mood. One day , his spirit is perfectly aligned on the moon, 
                  Mars and Jupiter. Next day, something happens, it changes his 
                  universe and doesn't know in which direction goes. He's lost.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  For his agent, the comparison with the hero of the last Wimbledon 
                  doesn't stop there. There's three years old, at the US Open, 
                  Ivanisevic spoke about the three or four Goran who were in himself, 
                  which took the power one after other. For Tsobanian, Marat is 
                  made by the same wood: &quot;Goran noticed that there were three 
                  or four persons who were in himself. Marat still knows that 
                  he has two sides: the champion and the guy who likes to do party 
                  with his friends. But he will soon see that there' are another 
                  sides. And he will discovers them with the time...&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Now, we have to wait to know which of them will take the advantage. 
                  The future career of a dominator of the Tour costs that price.<br>
