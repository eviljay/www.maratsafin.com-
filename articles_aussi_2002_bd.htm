                  by Denise Morris<br>
                  27 January 2002<br>
                  <br>
                  Today 27 January 2002 is Marat Safin's 22nd Birthday. Ideally 
                  it should have been a day of great celebration - all the ingredients 
                  were there. Highest seed left - previous Grand Slam winner - 
                  opponent several seeds below - he would be nervous - so Marat 
                  (unlike the last time he was in a Grand Slam Final) was the 
                  favourite. The pressure was on him to perform - would he do 
                  it?<br>
                  <br>
                  He looked the picture of the perfect player - tall, muscled 
                  and handsome, hair cut very short - all those rippling muscles 
                  enough to cause any woman to catch her breath - whatever her 
                  age. His opponent shorter, quieter and nervous though didn't 
                  show it - the only sign a slight quiver of the lips - the only 
                  noise the vociferous blue and yellow clad Swedish supporters 
                  to spur him on.<br>
                  <br>
                  The confident start to the first set - the break first game 
                  and then closing out the set thanks to a nervous start from 
                  the challenger - it all seemed to be going to plan.<br>
                  <br>
                  Plan - what plan - the blue and yellow brigade didn't follow 
                  that plan. They made more noise and spurred their player on 
                  and Marat's birthday plans were falling into disarray.<br>
                  <br>
                  All those brilliant returns were being undone - his backhand 
                  normally the strong point - more errors than winners. Whatever 
                  he tried somehow he couldn't unsettle the slight blonde man 
                  on the other side of the net. His legs pumped and he ran back 
                  and forth - but the challenger was the one who was getting the 
                  reward - where was the justice? It was Marat's birthday - he 
                  was supposed to win!<br>
                  <br>
                  We all expected that fragile edge of his mental calm to crack 
                  and splinter any minute. But somehow he kept reasonably stable 
                  apart from an occasional slight rumble and an almost smash of 
                  the racquet. The anguished mouthing to his bench &quot;What 
                  can I do - what must I do&quot;? He didn't give up trying and 
                  fought back in the 4th set to a Tiebreak and then it was over. 
                  The face was set and the disappointment was there. But he walked 
                  up and congratulated the winner and didn't show what must have 
                  been his anguish at the end of what should have been a fairytale 
                  birthday. <br>
                  <br>
                  And then we all saw the Presentation - Marat with a new maturity 
                  - a wonderfully gracious speech magnanimous in defeat. Thanking 
                  his &quot;family&quot;, telling his vanquisher to enjoy his 
                  victory - smiling and acknowledging as the crowd sang &quot;Happy 
                  Birthday&quot; - the better man won says Marat - even congratulating 
                  the opposition coach and the blue and yellow sea of fans.<br>
                  <br>
                  On that speech - Marat won the day. His opponent - the winner 
                  - sounded flat after that speech. But the biggest winner was 
                  the new, mature 22 year old who proved that he could take it 
                  on his cheek and come back fighting!<br>
                  <br>
                  In these first few hours - yes it is birthday blues but to me 
                  the fact is this is the starting anew - this is the beginning 
                  of Marat's year and it is going places. The man we have admired 
                  for so long has grown up today. His tennis will get better and 
                  better and he will attain new and better heights in this year 
                  2002. <br>
                  <br>
                  Don't despair - the temperament may have mellowed slightly but 
                  it will still be there. But the newer and better Marat Safin 
                  is going to thrill us beyond anything we ever knew.<br>
                  <br>
                  The best is yet to come! <br>
                  <br>
