                    THE MODERATOR: Questions for Marat, please.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Have a good time? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, great. Couldn't be better. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Let's go back to the tiebreaker, the end. Little bit like 
                    Grosjean a couple years ago - little bit, not too much. You're 
                    both down mini-breaks. You're down two mini-breaks to 3-2. 
                    What were you thinking then? Were you going to escape? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No, actually I thought it was the end, because 
                    I didn't play well at all. I couldn't serve because I just 
                    -- in the fifth set, I serve very, very badly. In the tiebreak, 
                    I was like -- I was really scared because I didn't want to 
                    lose. I was really choking.<br>
                    But I tried, you know, just to make him run because he was 
                    cramping. Just hanging there, maybe something will happen 
                    to him and he will retire or he will miss by himself, which 
                    he did. He made a few unforced errors in the tiebreak, a few 
                    forehands, and that's it.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Were you hoping he would quit? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yes, I was praying for it (laughter). Because 
                    I couldn't anymore, and just I wanted to finish this match 
                    because it just was terrible. Terrible match. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Ever had a first-round match like that?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: It's okay. Is good way to start, I think. Couldn't 
                    be worse, no (smiling)? <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How were you feeling? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: How I'm feeling? Dead. Completely dead. Really 
                    tired. Really tired. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Tired, but you weren't cramping yourself, or were you? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No, I start to feel something, you know, on 6-5. 
                    That's why I call the trainer, to make sure that I'm not fell 
                    down or something , to make sure that I'll be okay to play 
                    little bit, to be able to finish the match. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Did he show a lot of courage? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: What does it mean?<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Did your opponent show a lot of bravery in not quitting?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I mean, but -- I mean, if you are staying already 
                    for four hours, for four hours and a half, and then to quit 
                    so then you don't go out on the court. I think he did right. 
                    I mean, for sure he thought that he cannot finish the match. 
                    But at least if you are there already for four and a half 
                    hours and you are fighting, you know, doing everything to 
                    beat me, I mean, he did it right, I think. Was right decision. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You kept your head a little bit. You didn't go completely 
                    crazy. You must be happy about that? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I was going nuts, actually. Because I had no 
                    more racquets and chair umpire already told me that I should 
                    be careful. I had no more power to shout or to the racquets, 
                    so I couldn't anymore.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What do you mean you had no more racquets?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I finish all my racquets. I have only three left.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Only three left?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: So I have to be careful, yes.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How many did you start with?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Five. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. There are so many injuries these days in tennis. All the 
                    hip surgeries, Philippoussis having to stop because of the 
                    knee. Today during the match there were two wheelchairs that 
                    were waiting in the back walkway by the locker room. Do you 
                    think in the future, it would be a better idea if they just 
                    bring the wheelchairs right on the court? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I think -- thanks for the doctors that are thinking 
                    about us when we are playing. It's really nice, really nice 
                    to hear about that, that they are taking care of us.<br>
                    I hope it will not happen, this things, that we will have 
                    to drive out the court. I hope not. The injury for the players 
                    is the worst thing that can happen. Philippoussis, he fell 
                    down leading two sets to one. It's like it's a pity that you 
                    are trying. He came out of injury, he trying to come back, 
                    then you get injured again. Is the worst thing for a sportsman, 
                    because it takes a lot of time to come back and takes a lot 
                    of time to compete in the same level.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Can anything be done? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No. Unfortunately, no. It's really sad. That's 
                    why everybody, all the players are praying to not get injured. 
                    Any small injury, I mean a finger, some small muscles that 
                    you don't even know about them, they can bring you to trouble, 
                    you know, that you have to quit for two months. For two months, 
                    even for one month if you are out of the tournament, it's 
                    difficult to come back. You're not feeling the same way. The 
                    people are playing much better. It's -- the level of game 
                    is going, and you are just, you know -- you can do nothing. 
                    You have to start from zero.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Do you think the intense schedule is what is causing all 
                    the injuries, or you think it's just coincidence?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No, because I think the tennis is getting a little 
                    bit more powerful. You know, we're playing much faster, you 
                    know. Just level of tennis is growing. Everything is power 
                    and fitness and all these things.<br>
                    So that's why sometimes the body doesn't, you know -- you 
                    can't anymore. That's why it breaks. You need to rest sometimes 
                    and you also have to make your schedule in the right way. 
                    You cannot play like five weeks in a row. The body cannot 
                    anymore after two, three weeks because the tennis is -- everybody's 
                    playing such a high level that you need to take a rest every 
                    two, three weeks. Otherwise, your body will be dead.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You said you played a terrible match. What were the things 
                    you did wrong? Were they indicative of how you played this 
                    season?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I think way I played bad today is probably not 
                    because I just start to play well. First set was great, then 
                    I lost completely my concentration. I think because I didn't 
                    play since Cincinnati, since I lost Monday, I didn't play 
                    much. I didn't play a set.<br>
                    Of course it's difficult to play the tournament, come to Grand 
                    Slam and play a five-sets match and be prepared for that. 
                    Especially against Kiefer, he is a great player. I mean, he 
                    was 4 in the world. He knows how to play tennis.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Why did you take so much time off?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Injured. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Were you injured or were you sick?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I was sick and injured (laughter). Everything. 
                    <br>
                    I was sick, and I had problems with my ribs. That's why I 
                    withdraw from Indianapolis. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You had a very tough match with Grosjean when you won two 
                    years ago. Maybe this same thing can happen this year? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Hopefully. Would be great. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Is it possible? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Everything is possible in this life, as you can 
                    see. So I think would be great. Because it cannot be any worse, 
                    I cannot play any worse. So I think I'll get better and better.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How can the spectators help your game and how can they 
                    hurt it? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: It's great. It's always great, you know, when 
                    you're playing tough match and somebody's supporting you, 
                    somebody like cares about you in that moment, they want you 
                    to win. That's wonderful feeling. You're not feeling alone 
                    on the court. You're feeling like -- I know they give you 
                    some more energy and they help you to play. They help you 
                    keep playing and keep fighting. Otherwise, there is no spectators, 
                    it would be boring for us. <br>
                    The people, they are making the game more exciting. I'm really 
                    happy that they're coming, supporting the players. That's 
                    great. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Anything you wish they weren't doing?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No, no, no, no, no. Just support as much as they 
                    can. They should enjoy. We're entertainment for the people, 
                    right? <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Talking about injury, have you thought about what you want 
                    to do after your tennis career is over?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I'm still 22, man (laughter). <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Is there anything you've studied, anything you want to 
                    do beside play tennis? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I just start my first career. I have to finish 
                    first this one then I will think about other one. I hope I 
                    can play for few years more then I will think what I should 
                    do.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Being from another country, what do you think about what's 
                    going on here in America with baseball players? They're about 
                    to go on strike. What do you think of something like that? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: On strike, they're baseball players? <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Uh-huh. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I'm not a baseball fan (laughter). I'm not a 
                    baseball fan. I didn't even know that they're on strike. So 
                    I don't know, I have -- I think they have some reasons for 
                    that, right? Everybody has some reasons. So I think -- I think 
                    that they are right. It's their decision, they should do whatever 
                    they want.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Pete Sampras plays his first-round match tomorrow. Do you 
                    think we've seen the last of his great days, or you think 
                    he can get it back together?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: He's the greatest one. He's the best, the best 
                    player of all times. For me, the way he controls tennis for 
                    last six years, is amazing. Six years No. 1 in the world, 
                    13 Grand Slams. Just I cannot even talk about him, it's like 
                    talking about God, you know? The guy is the best one. He will 
                    be the best one. I don't think that there will be another 
                    Pete Sampras. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Who do you think has the best serve in the game today? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Serve? <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Yes. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: For me, the most difficult one, Arthurs. Arthurs, 
                    because lefty, beautiful motion, a lot of spin, power. It's 
                    very difficult to return. He beat Pete in Cincinnati. Is really 
                    difficult to play against the guy because he doesn't give 
                    you any rhythm, serves great, you know? He's tough player. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Have you watched your sister play yesterday?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What do you think? How did she play?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Definitely she played much better than me (laughing).<br>
                    No, it's good. She's first Grand Slam. It's difficult, you 
                    know, first round against Rita Grande. She's big player. I 
                    think she's good player. She was okay, you know. She tried. 
                    She was little bit nervous, is normal. She finished the match, 
                    she played well. Is the most important thing is to enjoy tennis, 
                    not just -- play, enjoy, have fun is what I want for my sister. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What about the next match? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Mine or hers? <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Hers. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I want to see that match. Doesn't matter if is 
                    gonna be -- I think Serena gonna win. But still, you know, 
                    it's nice feeling to play on center court, I hope so they 
                    gonna play there. Maybe for my sister, she will have such 
                    a big experience at the age of 16, I think it's great<br>
                    <br>
