                  Marat Safin returns to the North American hardcourt circuit 
                  next Monday, as the No. 2 seed at the Mercedes Benz Cup in Los 
                  Angeles. He then heads to the Tennis Masters Series Canada in 
                  Montreal, where he's the defending champion. He also will play 
                  at the Tennis Masters Cincinnati and RCA Championships in Indianapolis, 
                  where he reached the final last year. <br>
                  <br>
                  In 2000, he compiled a 12-2 record during the U.S. summer hard-court 
                  circuit going into the U.S. Open. Last year, Safin finished 
                  No. 2, the youngest player to finish No. 2 since Boris Becker 
                  in 1986. He had seven ATP titles, and he earned his first Grand 
                  Slam title at the U.S. Open with his win over Pete Sampras.<br>
                  <br>
                  Earlier this year, he suffered a back injury in Dubai, en route 
                  to the final. He's coming off a quarter final finish at Wimbledon. 
                  He's No. 2 in the ATP Entry System, and 20th in the ATP Champions 
                  Race.<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Q: Can you tell us about your health and also how you're looking 
                  forward to going into the summer circuit, being you had such 
                  a great year last year?<br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: Yes, I'm much better than before. I got injured unfortunately 
                  at the beginning of the year, just right before Indian Wells 
                  and Miami. I wouldn't get any points, and that was bad. I had 
                  a difficult time. You never know when you can come back and 
                  when you can start to play well. And also when you're coming 
                  from an injury, you don't have much confidence, and it's very 
                  tough to play again.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: You're going into part of the season that you just really 
                  dominated last year. How are you feeling, trying to go back 
                  and duplicate it or just taking it as it's going to come?<br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: Well, I think now that I'm healthy and everything is 
                  perfect. I played well at Wimbledon. I'm happy with this. I'm 
                  starting to play better. I hope I can make some good result 
                  there. And of course I will go for everything. I would like 
                  to win a tournament in America.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: Why did you decide to play L.A. this year?<br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: It's a big tournament and I think it's going to be tough, 
                  but it's a really good tournament to play in and it's really 
                  fun. Everybody told me it's a great. It's good preparation for 
                  a big tournament.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q. Have you ever been to Los Angeles before?<br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: The Los Angeles airport. But I would like to spend a 
                  week there.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: Have your back problems cleared up completely or is it something 
                  you have to monitor and do exercises for?<br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: No, I'm completely recovered. Now the problem is I don't 
                  have enough confidence to play big matches, but I'm looking 
                  forward. I think it's going to come back, but I think it's a 
                  little too late for this year, so I hope everything will be 
                  okay for next year.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: You just said you've had an up-and-down year and the confidence 
                  has sort of come in and out but you had a good result at Wimbledon. 
                  Can you give yourself a grade, if you had to give yourself a 
                  grade for this year, what would you assess your grade?<br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: It depends a lot on what I'm going to do in the States. 
                  It depends a lot on everything. It depends if I make a good 
                  result. I can finish everywhere, but if I make some good results, 
                  it would be great (inaudible). If everything goes in the right 
                  direction, I think it will be great. It will be perfect for 
                  me.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: How much pressure do you expect or what kind of feeling do 
                  you expect going into the U.S. Open this year, being the defending 
                  champion?<br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: The expectation is people will recognize me. It would 
                  be great. A new experience. I think something new and it's nice, 
                  but also it's very important you have control. So it's very 
                  important in the first round. If I'm going to be in the second 
                  week, I think I can make good results. I would like to make 
                  the semis. That would be great.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: And what is Mats Wilander doing for you?<br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: I'm really happy to work with him. I would never expect 
                  that Mats Wilander would work with me. I'm learning a lot. And 
                  I'm happy to be with him, actually. It's a great experience. 
                  He's coming to Montreal and we're going to start to work again 
                  and I'll be ready for the Open.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: Can you tell me where your game is right now compared to 
                  where you were last year at this time?<br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: It's not the same level as last year.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: About how far off do you think you're are?<br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: I don't know, 60 percent, if I'm lucky. It's now two 
                  or three difficult matches and then everything is changing. 
                  You start to play better and better and then at the end nobody 
                  can touch you. It's very important to win tough matches. And 
                  I couldn't make very many good results this year. I didn't win 
                  enough tough matches, so it's a little bit difficult. Every 
                  time you have a touch match, you have doubts about how you're 
                  playing and if you're going to win this match. Last year I didn't 
                  have any doubts about me and I was perfect. My condition was 
                  perfect. I was full of confidence. I was playing great and actually 
                  not many people touched me.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: Do you think you can get back to that level before you get 
                  to Flushing Meadows?<br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: I have to. I have to get there, and I hope I will. I 
                  would like to play well in the U.S. I always played well actually 
                  there, and I would like to make the same this year, play well 
                  and feel comfortable with everything and I think I can make 
                  it.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: I just want to know from Marat, the fact that he's coming 
                  into Montreal for the first time, is there anything in particular 
                  that he's going to try and do to get ready for this tournament? 
                  Has he heard anything positive about the venue?<br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: No, it's very important the first round. If you have 
                  a good draw, you start to play well and then (inaudible) its 
                  difficult to play against me if I'm playing well and I'm perfect, 
                  and physical conditions, and mentally I'm prepared. I'll be 
                  tough there. I will go for everything. I'll fight like a dog. 
                  I will be there. I will jump. I will dive. I will do everything 
                  possible to win the tournament.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: You said earlier you were at 60 percent, but physically now 
                  are you at 100 percent?<br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: Yes, physically I'm perfect, but the problem is that 
                  it is not only physical, it's mental and everything together 
                  is a player. I have some parts of a player that are key, but 
                  not yet.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: What do you expect from Montreal? What do you expect your 
                  first game on the court will be?<br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: I don't care about anything. I just want to win. It doesn't 
                  matter how. If it's going to be an ugly match or nice match, 
                  I want to win. I want to beat everybody and I want to get my 
                  game like it was last year. I want to get there.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: If you look over the last year, how has winning a Grand Slam 
                  title affected you most as a person?<br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: Actually, you don't realize this until I think you win 
                  the second time. I didn't win the second time, so I don't know 
                  how I feel. I feel happy, but I didn't enjoy it enough. I had 
                  no time to enjoy it. But the second time, I will win and hopefully 
                  it will be this year, maybe, I will enjoy it more and I will 
                  -- I can tell you which is better to win the first time or the 
                  second time. You need to have experience to enjoy it more.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: You mentioned about the confidence. Is it because you couldn't 
                  move as well because of your back injury or because you didn't 
                  feel as sharp in matches?<br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: No, because when you get injured and you don't play for 
                  two months, it's very difficult to come back and win matches 
                  right away, because you're not used to playing long matches. 
                  You're not used to running a lot. It's very difficult to start 
                  again after an injury. I was out for two months or more, and 
                  it's difficult to start again because everybody is playing well, 
                  everybody is full of confidence and I just start this year, 
                  two weeks before, but I think it's already too late to play 
                  tennis, but I'm trying.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: I'm just wondering, what is the thing that stands out in 
                  your mind, in your memory, when you think back to winning the 
                  U.S. Open last year? What's the one thing that comes to mind?<br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: I think that moment is the best moment of my life. I'm 
                  thinking right after the match point, I think it's the best 
                  memory that I have. It's like you feel so good and so -- the 
                  moment is just perfect. You've just won one of the biggest tournaments 
                  in the world. It's a Grand Slam tournament and you just won 
                  it two seconds ago and you feel so good. It's a good feeling.<br>
                  <br>
                  Q: I was just wondering, given the success you had last year 
                  and everything and then struggling as you had this year because 
                  of problems that you couldn't control, how have you dealt with 
                  all of those frustrations?<br>
                  <br>
                  SAFIN: It's tough to live with it. Everybody is playing great 
                  and you aren't playing well. People don't respect you anymore 
                  like a player. It's a difficult time, but you have to survive 
                  somehow and you have to keep working, keep trying, keep playing 
                  tournaments and one day it will come. And I'm just hoping the 
                  next year I will be 100 percent. The first of January I will 
                  be perfect. I'll be healthy and I can start the year like a 
                  normal person, like a normal player, not in the middle of the 
                  year or the season. <br>
