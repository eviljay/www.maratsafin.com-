                    <b>MODERATOR:</b> Questions for Marat. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>You're playing a very popular American, center court, 
                    semifinals. You go out there, play two great tiebreakers, 
                    get off in three sets. How does that happen? <br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> Actually, I thought different completely. 
                    I thought I was playing horrible today. Because I start, I 
                    was completely out of the court. I couldn't find my concentration. 
                    I played just without any pressure. Actually I couldn't find 
                    my concentration until the end of second set in the tiebreak. 
                    I said, "Listen, I'm going to lose, I can lose. I have a big 
                    chance to win this tiebreak and at least be in the match, 
                    be two-sets-to-Love, or I can be one set all, completely different 
                    game." I just had to concentrate. I was concentrated in important 
                    moments. In last two tiebreaker, I was a hundred percent concentrated, 
                    and that helped me. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>You've played very well in tiebreakers these past 
                    two weeks. What do you attribute that to?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: </b>I just played my game. I didn't risk too 
                    much. The guys, I don't know, probably they get scared in 
                    some points. They were going for too much. I don't know why, 
                    but I was just putting the ball inside of the court. I tried 
                    to build my point, but I wasn't going for too much. I just 
                    played. I served, I played, I start to build my point. Afterwards, 
                    the guys, they just didn't know what to do. I don't know what 
                    happened with them, but they just make me few presents in 
                    the tiebreaks.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Todd said he feels like you play the first point 
                    of the match and the last point of the match, every point 
                    in the middle, the same way, in the sense you play it loose. 
                    You'll go for a shot, whether it's a tiebreak, whether it's 
                    Love-40, whatever. Do you feel that same way in your mind? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I tell you, I was there, I was on the 
                    court. I said, "Come on, man, how can I play like this? I'm 
                    playing horrible." After I saw statistic, it was 54% of the 
                    first serve, 13 aces. Actually I start to think, "Actually, 
                    I wasn't play so bad." But on the court, it was completely 
                    different. I was shouting on myself, even I broke one racquet, 
                    because I couldn't believe that I can play so badly. After 
                    I went out, I look at the score, 6-3, 7-6, 7-6, two tiebreaks. 
                    To beat Todd Martin in two tiebreaks, you have to be a good 
                    player, also in the semifinals. Now I start to realize that 
                    I'm not so bad.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Do you ever get nervous on important points? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I wasn't nervous at all. I just couldn't 
                    find my concentration. I was out of the court. I don't know. 
                    I played the game because the ball is coming, I hitting somewhere. 
                    Sometimes I made a great points. It was like a machine. The 
                    guy's coming to the net, so it was a lob, suddenly unbelievable 
                    one. "Good." It was more or less like this. I didn't even 
                    think. I didn't even get scared. When I had to concentrate, 
                    I made it. I was a little bit negative on the court probably, 
                    but I played great tennis, I think. I made so many lobs when 
                    he went to the net. The guy is two meters and I pass him. 
                    I played some pretty good points. But now I start to realize 
                    this, but not on the court. Too late.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>The first week of this tournament, against Pozzi 
                    and Grosjean, your mind was wandering, you played some bad 
                    sets, forgot your clothes in another match. The second week, 
                    you seemed so much calmer and more in control of everything 
                    on the court. What's happened mentally to you in the second 
                    week of this tournament? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Because I had too much energy on my body. 
                    I didn't play for one week, so everything was inside of me. 
                    But now I don't have any power even to throw the racquet. 
                    I throw only once today and I broke it. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Did it break?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah. Okay, thank you. Go to pay the fine, 
                    okay? Now it start to help me because I don't have energy, 
                    you know, to give everything out of me, throwing the racquet, 
                    shouting, talking with spectators, with my coach, with some 
                    other guys, with the chair umpire. I'm just thinking about 
                    my game. I think it's right, I'm going in the right direction. 
                    Actually, that's why I'm in final, I think. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>You've said before that you've idolized Pete Sampras. 
                    If you get the chance to play him tomorrow in the final, how 
                    will that affect your mental approach? <br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> First of all, if I'm going to play against 
                    him, spectators going to be with him definitely. I don't think 
                    spectators going to be with me, that's for sure. He's with 
                    a lot of confidence, so he going to serve well, he going to 
                    play pretty sure in the volley. It's already many things against 
                    me. I will try to start the game, try to put him under pressure, 
                    just start from the first point to return his serve, run for 
                    the balls even if I can't get them, you know, to show to the 
                    guy that I'm going to fight for it. I don't want to make him 
                    Christmas presents. It's very important. He knows that I'm 
                    going to be there from the first point until the last one. 
                    Maybe I will have the chance. If I have it, I will try to 
                    make it. If I don't have a chance, what can I do? It's Pete, 
                    you know, 13 Grand Slams he won, No. 1 in the world. It's 
                    already a lot of things. I will try to make my game. I hope 
                    it will works. If not, what can I do? Final's okay. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> What about Lleyton Hewitt? What are your thoughts 
                    about Lleyton? <br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> Lleyton is different style, but more or less 
                    the same thing. Because Pete, he's a lot of confidence. Lleyton 
                    is also, because he's in semifinal, he's playing great tennis. 
                    He won the US Open in doubles. He's a good shape now, big 
                    fighter. He improve his serve. He can serve some aces. Good 
                    passing shot. Also, another time, big fighter. You have to 
                    be -- you have to push him since the beginning. You can't 
                    let him play. The same like with Pete. He going to go to the 
                    net, Pete. Lleyton, he going to be in the baseline. Both of 
                    them, you cannot let them play, otherwise you have no chance 
                    against them.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>(Inaudible)?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> If they going to walk over in the final. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Do you think tomorrow will feel differently, being 
                    a Grand Slam final, than any other tennis match?<br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: </b>I think I have enough experience not to be 
                    very nervous in the final. I hope I will not be. But I don't 
                    know. You have to ask me a minute before I go to the court. 
                    If you see me that I cannot talk, I'm afraid. If I can talk, 
                    so I'm okay (laughter). <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Can you come in here before you take the court tomorrow?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> Huh (laughter)?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Never mind. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>If it is you and Lleyton tomorrow, it will be like 
                    the "New Balls" campaign coming to life. Would there be some 
                    pride of feeling, "The new guys are taking over now, the new 
                    generation in men's tennis"? <br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> Is not the question to me; is the question 
                    to the crowd. They have to decide.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> Feeling like you're a part of that, though. <br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> Yeah, but so what? I'm 20, he's 19. Is not 
                    a question of the age. Also we're part of this big show, tennis 
                    game, a part of this big group. We just youngsters, but it 
                    doesn't matter. It's a question how going to react the public 
                    to this, to us, to two youngsters. Already they want to see 
                    Pete, they want to see Agassi. They don't know us yet. It 
                    depend of the crowd if we going to be famous or we not going 
                    to be famous. For the moment, they didn't even know me in 
                    - how to say - transportation desk. Can you believe it?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Were you trying to get a ride somewhere? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Yes. I called like three times, "Please, 
                    can I have a car to come to the stadium?" "What's your name?" 
                    "Safin." "Can you spell it, please?" We're calling like three 
                    times a day every day. It's not so difficult to remember this 
                    name. Is not so difficult. But the people, you know, if the 
                    crowd going to be like this, is no chance to be somebody in 
                    the world. It depends of the crowd. My name is Safin. Next 
                    time I will go with sign, "I'm Marat Safin," so the people 
                    can remember me (indicating a sign on his forehead).<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Have I got this straight? You thought you played 
                    horrible because you couldn't concentrate, but you played 
                    very well, so maybe you shouldn't concentrate. What's the 
                    answer? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN:</b> I still don't know. I don't know. I was 
                    (inaudible) on the court. Everything I was doing was wrong, 
                    but was right actually. Don't make me headache, please. I 
                    cannot answer for you what, how I have to feel, what I need 
                    on the court. It's difficult for me to analyze this situation. 
                    Actually, I think I didn't play so bad. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> No, you didn't. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>But I think about this a different way, 
                    so I don't know. Now I don't know what I have to think. I 
                    am lost. <br>
                    <b><br>
                    Q.</b> Might you be kidding us? You came in here the other 
                    day and said that everything you say is not necessarily true, 
                    that it's just words.<br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> No. If the guys ask me, somebody ask me, 
                    if the player, they want to be No. 1 in the world. Kafelnikov, 
                    he said that he doesn't want. That's not true. He's not stupid 
                    guy. If he has opportunity to be No. 1 in the world, I don't 
                    think, "No, no, guys, I don't need it, really. I'm okay." 
                    Sometimes you have to be at least a little bit -- you have 
                    to understand the players. I know why you're asking me this 
                    question, is because somebody ask me if I want to be No. 1 
                    in the world. The players, they want to be No. 1 in the world. 
                    Kafelnikov said, "No, I don't need this." That's like is not 
                    true, I think so. He want to be No. 1 in the world. I want 
                    to be there. All the guys, they want to be in the top.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q</b>. Why do you think you won today? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>I fight. I fight. That's it. Even if I 
                    still think that I was playing bad, I was there from the beginning 
                    until the end, last point. I was trying to run everywhere, 
                    try to make points, try to serve, try to make something new. 
                    I was there. I become a fighter.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>How were you able to explain how you started the 
                    year so poorly, you couldn't win a match for a few months, 
                    now you almost can't lose a match, you're the hottest player 
                    on the tour?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Just maybe I become a little bit -- I 
                    have a little bit more of experience. Probably I grow up. 
                    I start to understand that if I want to be a good player, 
                    I have to be a little bit more professional, I have to practice 
                    a little bit more, I have to be -- pay a little bit more attention 
                    to practice, the matches, start to fight, because I never 
                    fight. If I'm playing good, I was playing unbelievable tennis. 
                    When I was playing bad, I couldn't win even -- I couldn't 
                    beat my mother. It's a question of I just start to fight from 
                    April. Everybody told me, "Come on, man, fight. One day everything 
                    going to come, the confidence, the strokes. Start to fight." 
                    I start to practice with the head, not with the strokes, and 
                    everything came. Now I try to keep this situation, to keep 
                    this confidence. It's working.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>How does it feel to be the first Russian to reach 
                    the US Open final?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Nice. It's still something missing. I 
                    don't know why, but I want to win, you know. It's strange 
                    feeling, you know. When you get something - I explain - when 
                    you get a million, you want two millions. When you have two 
                    millions, you want five. When you have five, you want ten. 
                    You want first to be in the semifinal. When you get to the 
                    semifinal, is not enough. The final, okay. So I'm in the final. 
                    I feel I need something more, which is win the tournament. 
                    If I win the tournament, after we talk. But now for the moment, 
                    I still want to win the final. I want to feel this situation. 
                    Maybe I'm going to shout. Maybe I'm going to get undressed 
                    on the court. I don't know what I'm going to do if I win. 
                    It's a great feeling to be a champion of US Open. But now 
                    I don't feel anything special. Sorry.<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> What is your relationship with Yevgeny?<br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Friends. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q. </b>Close? <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>MARAT SAFIN: </b>Not very close, but friends. We have different 
                    age, different generation. It's difficult to have the same 
                    interest. We just friends. We're not very close, but I respect 
                    him, he respect me, we're in the same business, we're playing 
                    for Russia. We have to respect each other. That's it. <br>
                    <br>
                    <b>Q.</b> It seemed like Todd Martin was tired out there, 
                    did it seem to you? <br>
                    <b><br>
                    MARAT SAFIN:</b> I knew. I felt it because he make some easy 
                    mistakes. If you make some easy mistakes, you can't concentrate. 
                    He was tired, so he was tired to be a hundred percent concentrated 
                    on easy balls. I can feel it. Also he was a little bit lazy. 
                    He was going late to the net. He didn't move very well. You 
                    can see it. In first half set, I could understand that he 
                    wasn't his best condition. <br>
