                  <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Q. 
                  It seems that the first set was not going your way. What was 
                  the problem? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: The problem, it was like, first of all, I wasn't 
                    -- he start to play very well, he start to push from the forehand, 
                    he played very fast. I was 3-2 up I think with a break, right? 
                    Then just I lost a little bit of concentration and he played 
                    really well. Then second set, I just found my game. More or 
                    less I start to do what I had to do from the beginning, just 
                    doesn't let him to dominate the game.<br>
<br>
Q. Were you surprised that he played so consistently in the 
                    first set?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No and yes. I mean, first of all, because he's 
                    not playing for a long time. He was injured. And I wasn't 
                    surprised because he won three matches here, was playing great. 
                    But is difficult, you know. After a long time, didn't play 
                    many matches, so it was really impressive the way he start 
                    to play the match. It was very dangerous. I was a little bit 
                    scared even in the beginning. I thought that he going to play 
                    like this for -- if he can play for a long time...But as you 
                    can see, if I can find my game, then it's different story. 
                <br>
<br>
Q. What do you think about your game today - especially about 
                    your serve? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I think my serve saved my game today. I think 
                    was very important to hold your serve and try to play your 
                    game, even if it didn't work at the beginning. I mean, I was 
                    nervous. He played well. But then I just start to do what 
                    I had to do, you know, just push him, make him run a little 
                    bit. And you can't let him play from the place, because from 
                    the place he can play really good. He has a very good topspin, 
                    he is very fast, he is very good and patient. Is dangerous. 
                    I could manage after losing the first set, I could manage 
                    to find it. And I'm satisfied the way I played, the way I 
                    served, and the way I fought.<br>
<br>
Q. Physically you look very good. <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, quite well. I played a few tough matches. 
                    But physically, I'm really good. My masseur is doing quite 
                    a very good job. I'm satisfied. I'm happy to be in the second 
                    week and to be in the quarterfinals, to play against Grosjean. 
                    I'm looking forward.<br>
<br>
Q. So Grosjean. <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Tough match. French player. Public against me. 
                    The same story like today. It's very important to start well 
                    against him because he's playing quite well. He has a lot 
                    of confidence now. Central court. It's going to depend on 
                    me, the way I will start. If I will start early and make an 
                    early break, then it's going to be -- then I can dominate 
                    the match. If I will start a little bit lazy, he will make 
                    me a break or he will win the first set, I will be in trouble. 
                    So it depends on me.<br>
<br>
Q. Do you feel as well in this tournament as you felt in 
                    the Australian Open, for example?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Like what? <br>
<br>
Q. Your game. <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No, it's different story. I mean, hard court 
                    is a hard court. Here clay. Clay change a lot. Still if you 
                    are losing, I don't know, 5-3 or even 5-Love, you can change 
                    the game. So you have more options here. But you have to be 
                    more concentrated here because if you lose your game on clay, 
                    it's difficult. You can come back but, you know, like especially 
                    tomorrow or day after tomorrow, it's difficult to come back 
                    against a French player. You have to be careful. But, still, 
                    it has nothing to do with Australian Open. It's a new Grand 
                    Slam - different one - and you have to be careful with every 
                    player.<br>
<br>
Q. Marc Rosset was in the semis here. Did he bring you some 
                    good advice about clay and Roland Garros? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but I think I have more experience than 
                    him on clay (smiling). I basically have been born on clay. 
                    I played a lot of satellites on clay. Still I make quarterfinals 
                    in 2000. I have a tough match against Norman. I can also play 
                    here and I can make some good results, I can be dangerous. 
                    But, of course, he told me few times that he made the semifinals 
                    here. He could have -- I know even why he lost in the semifinals 
                    here. It was a secret, so (laughter). But it was okay. It 
                    was a good experience. I think it's a pity for him that he 
                    was in semifinals, play Kafelnikov in the finals, he would 
                    never lose against him. Kafelnikov and him, they have the 
                    discussion, who would win the finals here in '96. <br>
<br>
Q. A question about the crowd. They weren't necessarily on 
                    your side today. You seemed to use that to your advantage. 
                    You enjoy going out there and entertaining the crowd. <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I try, but they were like, you know, sometimes 
                    in the third or fourth set, they were completely against me. 
                    So you're feeling a little bit lonely on the court. But, I 
                    mean, you have to understand I'm playing in France, I'm not 
                    playing in Russia or other country. So it's okay. I think 
                    you can survive like this. Still you can win some matches.<br>
<br>
Q. What were you doing? One point in the seventh game of 
                    the third set where you started jumping up and down. Were 
                    you trying to get the ballboy's attention?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No, because I tried to get the ball from the 
                    ballboy. But the ballboy, he was too busy, with each other, 
                    I think (smiling). I was trying to repeat the mistake, just 
                    to hit the ball again. But the ballboy, he didn't care about 
                    me anymore. <br>
<br>
Q. In 2000, when you arrived in the quarterfinals, you were 
                    mentally very tired. Is it totally different now? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: It's two years later. I mean, I played a lot 
                    of matches there. I have no such experience like I having 
                    now. I was just climbing up, No. 12 in the world. I didn't 
                    have so much experience like I'm having now. I consider myself 
                    a little bit more clever than two years ago. I know what I 
                    have to do. Even now I can make mistakes, but still I would 
                    not make mistake that I did in 2000. So it's a little bit 
                    different story. <br>
