                  05, 2002, Sports Palace &quot;Luzhniki&quot;, Moscow, RUS, by 
                  Nick Imison<br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Marat Safin avenged his Australian Open final defeat by Thomas 
                  Johansson to give Russia a 1-0 lead over Sweden in their Davis 
                  Cup by BNP Paribas quarterfinal at the Luzhniki Sports Palace 
                  this afternoon. The 22-year-old from Moscow produced a display 
                  of power serving to ease to a straight sets victory by the symmetrical 
                  scoreline of 6-4 6-4 6-4.<br>

This was a different Safin to the player who faded under 
                    a weight of home expectation in Russia's first round match 
                    against Switzerland and lost the opening rubber to Roger Federer 
                    in straight sets. In fact it was Johansson will looked ill 
                    at ease on court at the start of the match, allowing his opponent 
                    to reel off the first four games before most of the crowd 
                    were able to find their seats.<br>
<br>
Serving at 5-2, Safin managed to get embroiled in a row with 
                    the umpire over an overrule which saw the Russian face his 
                    first break point. Safin lost the game, and temporarily his 
                    cool, but managed to compose himself sufficiently to serve 
                    out for the set two games later. That was to be the only break 
                    point the Russian faced all match.<br>
<br>
Johansson was able to raise his game in the second set, and 
                    although making little impression on Safin's service, was 
                    managing to hold his own delivery comfortably.<br>
                    The turning point of the match came in the ninth game, where 
                    Johansson saved two break points, before a backhand winner 
                    by the Russian set up a third. The Swede then doublefaulted 
                    to hand his opponent the break, and Safin served out to love 
                    to build up a two sets lead.<br>
<br>
As the crowd in the stadium began to find its voice, so Safin 
                    managed to keep up the pressure. After surviving two deuces 
                    on his serve to level at 3-3, he then capitalised on a second 
                    break point in the following game, where a fierce backhand 
                    return brought an error from the Swede.<br>
<br>
Three games later the match was over and it was fitting that 
                    the Russian should complete his 2 hour 16 minute victory with 
                    his 11th ace.<br>

Afterwards Safin admitted that Russia's victory over Switzerland 
                    had helped prepare him for this tie: &quot;At the beginning 
                    of the match I felt that Thomas was not yet ready to play 
                    on clay. It is difficult to move on the surface if you haven't 
                    played on it for a while. I have already experienced it this 
                    year against Switzerland, and know how to play on clay as 
                    I grew up on the surface in Spain. Thomas is better on fast 
                    courts so I went into the match with a lot of confidence.<br>
<br>
&quot;Today I tried to remain focused as he's a top ten player 
                    and you can never relax. However I didn't give him a chance 
                    from the beginning, and managed not to focus on my errors.&quot;<br>

Johansson cited Safin's serve rather than the court surface 
                    as the difference between the two players today. &quot;Marat 
                    served very well, especially in the second and third sets. 
                    I started really badly but I played better and better as the 
                    match went on. I kept having chances at 15-30, 30-30, but 
                    he managed to serve his way out. It was too bad I couldn't 
                    have taken the second or third sets.&quot;<br>
<br>
The Swede agreed that the Russians benefited from home advantage. 
                    &quot;They are playing at home and made the right decision 
                    to play on clay, as both players have won titles on that surface. 
                    However it is a little quicker indoors and I think I had a 
                    chance today.&quot;<br>
