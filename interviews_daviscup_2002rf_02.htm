                  An Interview with the Russian Team</strong><br>
                  <a href="http://www.daviscup.com/" target="_blank">www.daviscup.com</a><br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>What was the difference today in favor of the French 
                  team?</strong> <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: The difference was that they start to play well 
                  at 2-Love in the fourth set. They were just lucky so many times. 
                  We were basically controlling the match. They made a break, 
                  they started to playing well. Every shot that they hit, everything 
                  was good. Any shot they make, it was perfect. At the end, of 
                  course, they just take confidence, and that's why they beat 
                  us. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Why did you lose your serve at 3-2 in the fourth set? 
                  Was it a question of mental or physically? What was it?</strong><br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: The score was 3-2, 3-All, I don't know. I knew 
                  that I had to hold the serve. Unfortunately, I didn't serve 
                  any first serves, but I had good second serves. <br>
                  They played well and I couldn't do anything. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Do you think it was the turning point of the match? 
                  </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but still we had the opportunity. We could 
                  have made the second break to Escude in the fourth set. But 
                  then they start to play well. They get confident. That's it. 
                  Of course, they made the break to us. They start to play well. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>You played well during the second and third set. Escude 
                  left the court. Did it stop your good shape? </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: No, it didn't stop the momentum. As you 
                  would probably recall, we made a break right away, were up 2-Love. 
                  At that time, you know, momentum was completely on our side. 
                  But then, like Marat said, we lost a very unfortunate game at 
                  2-Love on Santoro's serve with two shanks of Escude's frames. 
                  If it would be in the fourth set, the match would be over. Unfortunately, 
                  I lost my serve at 2-1 with a few also net balls. Santoro was 
                  coming up with unbelievable lobs throughout the match. When 
                  it happened like that, we give them confidence again back, and 
                  then they start to play. Then basically we had to start the 
                  whole match all over again. <br>
                  <strong><br>
                  What is your feeling now this evening? </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  YEVGENY KAFELNIKOV: Feeling (laughter)? You know, there is always 
                  another day, tomorrow. The matches are not over. We'll see what 
                  happen tomorrow. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>You have played nine sets. You will play against someone 
                  who has only played three sets. How do you see this match? </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: We'll have to play, and we'll have to play well. 
                  We'll have to win if we want to still be in the match and still 
                  have an opportunity to win the Davis Cup. Unfortunately, it's 
                  2-1, I have to play tomorrow after having played a long match. 
                  I will play. I will see tomorrow. I will try to recover from 
                  today and I will try to win tomorrow, if you want to still have 
                  a chance to win. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>I would like to ask how the captain explains the defeat 
                  in five sets against the French today. </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  CAPTAIN TARPISCHEV: Well, the game was equal, and I think that 
                  both teams played rather well. But I must say that both team 
                  deserved the victory, but the French team was a bit more lucky 
                  to win. My congratulations.<br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>You don't show a lot of emotion when you're sitting 
                  on your chair. You're not talking a lot to your players. The 
                  players don't talk to each other. Is it always the same on the 
                  Russian team or is there a problem? </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  CAPTAIN TARPISCHEV: Well, this is our style. It's really our 
                  Russian style. I must say that I am sitting on my bench for 
                  25 years, and that's why all the guys, all the players are accustomed 
                  to this way of behavior. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Before the game, you heard the court is especially made 
                  for Santoro. Did he take advantage of the court? </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  CAPTAIN TARPISCHEV: I would say it is not attributed only to 
                  Santoro. As far as the advances to the net are concerned, the 
                  French team played better. They played better the volleys, as 
                  well. This is the result of the match. That's why they won. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Tomorrow Marat Safin will have played nine sets. He's 
                  playing against Grosjean who only played three sets. How do 
                  you see that match? Are you sure you'll use Kafelnikov if it's 
                  2-All? </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  CAPTAIN TARPISCHEV: You know, the thing is our bench is not 
                  as long as the bench of the French team. That is one of the 
                  reasons our game was playing this way. As far as tomorrow's 
                  match is concerned, we'll see how we'll play it. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Why are you so sure Grosjean will play tomorrow? </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  CAPTAIN TARPISCHEV: It's not my question. I've never benched 
                  Grosjean playing. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Yesterday it was said the result of this match will 
                  be decided by the service and by the return of serve. Can you 
                  comment on that? </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  CAPTAIN TARPISCHEV: Well, it's a technical question. Safin is 
                  playing very well and he's keeping his side very firmly. His 
                  service is a bit less strong than the service of the Safin. 
                  That is one of the reasons he played that way. This is only 
                  one part of the question. I will elaborate a bit. <br>
                  Remember, Safin made several faults. The last so to say straight 
                  period of the match, it was an undesirable period for us. That 
                  is why it all happens like that. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Do you think Safin was too sure of himself, was sure 
                  that you would win the match soon, and he relaxed? </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  CAPTAIN TARPISCHEV: There was no relaxation on the part of Safin. 
                  The thing is that you cannot just lead the match, you cannot 
                  play the match on the same level, and that is why. Those who 
                  did try, those who overcame such drawbacks. Unfortunately, we 
                  failed to do it. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>What was the reason why Safin and Kafelnikov did not 
                  play together in ATP tournaments? Maybe you remember that Santoro 
                  and Escude played together. </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  CAPTAIN TARPISCHEV: I'll answer you like this. Unfortunately, 
                  Kafelnikov was not that good as far as his health was concerned. 
                  Safin, unfortunately did not have enough points to make it. 
                  That's why they played only two tournaments together. This is 
                  such a problem that cannot be overcome and overpassed by the 
                  captain of the team. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>What should be done in order to win the match, starting 
                  from '77 the team who was losing the doubles never managed to 
                  win the match. What should be done in order to win the match? 
                  </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  CAPTAIN TARPISCHEV: There are no laws here. We should play, 
                  and we may win. The thing is that we must recreate today and 
                  then we'll see how it goes. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>What is the state of Kafelnikov and do you think he'll 
                  play tomorrow? </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  CAPTAIN TARPISCHEV: I'll give you the definite answer for this. 
                  Tomorrow you're playing on which side? Kind of a joke. I'll 
                  give you the answer tomorrow. <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Are they ready psychologically? </strong><br>
                  <br>
                  CAPTAIN TARPISCHEV: Yes, I would say a lot of facts depends 
                  on psychological readiness. I think tomorrow we'll see how it 
                  goes and how the two players will play. <br>
