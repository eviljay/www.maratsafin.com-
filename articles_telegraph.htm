                    Telegraph magazine 9 June 2001 <br>
                    Article by: Giles Smith <br>
                    <br>
                    New balls, please <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    On a chilly Sunday evening in May at the Foro Italico in Rome, 
                    the day before the Italian open, a throng stood on the concrete 
                    steps beneath the tall, pollarded trees, raptly watching a 
                    21-year-old from Moscow in a grey sweat-marked T-shirt hit 
                    tennis balls on a red clay court. Even on a day off, Marat 
                    Safin pulls a crowd.<br>
                    It's a trick that has come easily to him since last September 
                    when, at the age of 20 and in only his third year on the professional 
                    circuit, he overwhelmed Pete Sampras, the pre-eminent tennis 
                    player of the modern age, in the final of the US Open. For 
                    most players, overwhelming Sampras is not a option, least 
                    of all in the final of a Grand Slam. <br>
                    Safin managed it in straight sets, 6-4, 6-3, 6-3, initiating 
                    a global flurry of excitement, as if at the overthrow of an 
                    old order. President Clinton phoned him; President Putin sent 
                    a telegram. <br>
                    <br>
                    Just 10 months earlier, Safin had failed to get past the first 
                    round in fiveconsecutive tournaments, and had a very seriously 
                    considered giving up tennis and opening a bar. By November 
                    he had reached number one in the world rankings and, as if 
                    in a public declaration of his intention to do this tennis-star 
                    thing properly, had bought himself an apartment in Monte Carlo. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From the point of view of the professionals tour’s officials, 
                    promoters and sponsors, and the people who write about tennis 
                    for a living, it couldn’t have happened to a better person. 
                    Highly sensitive to accusations of dullness and anonymity, 
                    men’s tennis lives in perpetual fear of domination by the 
                    kind of blank-faced serve and volley artists that Safin is 
                    most emphatically not. This anxiety is by no means new. Nothing 
                    that the average number of shots exchanged in a men’s tennis 
                    match had shrunk by two thirds inside six years, the American 
                    writer John McPhee observed that, for some people, the efficiency 
                    of modern play- “the so-called Big Game (overwhelming serves 
                    followed by savage attacks at the net)”- threatened “to diminish 
                    tennis itself”. McPhee was writing in 1969. <br>
                    <br>
                    Thirty-two years on, the sport has yet to disappear, but still 
                    the pleas is heard, with varying degrees of desperation, for 
                    “personalities” and “characters.” Recently the cry has been 
                    particularly loud. A generation is passing: Boris Becker has 
                    gone; Andre Agassi is 31. Vacancies are opening up at the 
                    top of men’s tennis for a torch-carrier. And the tennis world 
                    and its press have latched gratefully on to Safin, a player 
                    not only copiously and clearly gifted (John McEnroe said two 
                    years ago that Safin would rise to the top 10), but openly 
                    emotional and expressive into the bargain, and not above a 
                    bit of the clowning that tennis audiences enjoy. <br>
                    He’s a ball-kicker, a ground-stamper- best of all, a racket-smasher. 
                    Safin smashes rackets for Russia. He estimates that he has 
                    trashed 150 to date which, as the tennis magazine Ace notes 
                    with relish, is “more than any other player on the circuit.” 
                    <br>
                    He also seems to go through coaches the way other players 
                    go through sweatbands, employing the Russian Andrei Chesnokov 
                    and Alexander Volkov for seven months in 2000, then returning 
                    for five months to Rafael Mensua, who had coached him through 
                    college, before taking up with the reserved and often sloppily 
                    dressed Swede Mats Wilander in February of this year. “I don’t 
                    think Mats is doing it for the money.” Safin told me. “He 
                    thinks I can be a great player.” The feeling has rapidly grown 
                    that Safin is a young incomer who has it in him to win the 
                    biggest trophies in the sport and, incidentally, along the 
                    way jawline still sports the occasional solitary but impressive 
                    pimple. But it seems to be fine by Safin, whose own ambition, 
                    he told me, in an alarming casual way, is “to make history.” 
                    <br>
                    Recently, however, history has had to wait. This year, to 
                    his intense frustration,Safin has been harassed by damaged 
                    nerves in his back. In pain every time he served, he withdrew 
                    from the circuit for two months to receive treatment. Come 
                    May, he was still tentatively edging his way back and had 
                    yet to find his best form. <br>
                    <br>
                    So Sunday evening in Rome found him with the season’s major 
                    tournaments looming (after the French Open in Paris, his schedule 
                    brings him to Stella Artois tournament at Queen’s next week 
                    where he will prepare for Wimbledon, prior to defending the 
                    US Open in New York) but, in his own expression, “back at 
                    zero”, with everything to prove. Practising, Safin looked 
                    deceptively casual. With the grey T-shirt, he wore some checked 
                    shorts of the kind one might take on holiday. Only his feet 
                    were dressed for business. <br>
                    What he had on were not shoes so much pieces of advanced foot 
                    technology. <br>
                    <br>
                    Moulded and padded, they resembled some curious amalgm of 
                    a princess’s slipper and a dog’s chewable toy. <br>
                    For an hour, Safin pounded balls down the court in the direction 
                    of his hired hitter, who serves the same hapless function 
                    as a heavyweight boxer’s sparring partner someone to work 
                    out on.<br>
                    <br>
                    “Touch,” Safin would tell me later, “is not my best thing,” 
                    by which he meant he declicacies, the drop-shots, the stop-volleys, 
                    the lobs. What he specialises in is power, for which he is 
                    physically equipped. Safin stands 6ft 4in- all neck and back. 
                    <br>
                    During the enormous, whistling forehand swing through the 
                    ball that eventually brings the racket head to a point way 
                    behind and above his head, his torso is entirely still, lending 
                    his play, for all its meaty, ballsocking power, a graceful 
                    and distinctly cool absence of effort.<br>
                    <br>
                    He is also - unfashionably in men’s tennis, and still less 
                    fashionably in women’s tennis - entirely gruntless. As he 
                    worked, the dutiful silence was broken only by the “pock” 
                    of the balls and by the occasional burst of fluent cursing 
                    in Russian, Spanish and English.<br>
                    “Ach!” Safin spat, as a bounce eluded him. “The shittiest 
                    court in the world!” In concentration, he tends to hold a 
                    slightly pursed expression, as if ready at any moment to unleash 
                    a tantrum; but he also has a grin which can erupt across his 
                    face and ignite his eyes. This happened when, for instance, 
                    he deliberately sent a pair of balls down to his hitter, just 
                    to confuse him. <br>
                    <br>
                    These things are done to relieve the tedium. And relieving 
                    the tedium does seem important to Safin who, despite the job 
                    in hand, remains alert to what is happening on the periphery 
                    - players threading their way along the path from other courts, 
                    the arrival or departure of fans on the concrete.<br>
                    <br>
                    Earlier that afternoon, Andre Agassi had practised on these 
                    courts (his session whooped at and applauded by a packed crowd 
                    as if it were matchplay) and, as he scuttled about his business, 
                    his eyes at no point strayed beyond the tramlines. “Focus” 
                    is a word tennis players use a lot. <br>
                    They try to focus, try to remain focused, try to feel focused. 
                    Agassi has focus. But what of Safin, a multi-millionaire at 
                    21, with expectation stacked up above him? Will the distractions 
                    get to him? Can he focus? Can he stay focused? <br>
                    <br>
                    After Practice, at 7.30om, Safin pulled on a sweater, packing 
                    his bag and negotiated the warren of whitewashed tunnels beneath 
                    the stadium. He has the detached, slightly slouchy walk of 
                    the sportsman, scuffing his heels, his arms loose, rolling 
                    slightly from side to side - the walk of someone who is persevering 
                    his energy for other things.<br>
                    At the gate, he tossed his bag into the boot of the courtesy 
                    car and slumped into the rear seat. One could not be certain 
                    whether it was his back or the hour of day, but that last 
                    hour on the clay had not lifted him. In the car - his legs 
                    too big for the space, his bare knees up comically high - 
                    he looked darkly out at Rome speeding by and grumbled into 
                    the window in a Muscovite drawl: “The thing about being injured, 
                    it feels like nobody respects you any more. <br>
                    The players don’t look at you like a huge tennis player. They 
                    don’t respect you that much.” But no mood seems to stay long 
                    with Safin and by the times the car was pulling on to the 
                    lavishly fountained forecourt of the Cavalieri Hilton, he 
                    had visibly lightened. He ordered a Coke and, still unshowered 
                    and unchanged, sprawled across a sofa in the expensively lit 
                    bar as a pianist played selections from the international 
                    hotel lobby repertoire (Rodgers and Hart, Stevie Wonder).<br>
                    <br>
                    I asked Safin if he had been serious about retiring. “Why 
                    not?” he said, shrugging. “If you don’t enjoy it any more, 
                    why suffer? Enjoy your life and do what you like.” And opening 
                    a bar? “Again why not?” It was going to be in Moscow. “Of 
                    course,” he said. “You can’t make huge money in that business. 
                    But you can have fun and be with your friends.” Fun, friends, 
                    money: these are themes Safin returns to- particularly the 
                    way, in his case, earning the money can get in the way of 
                    having the fun and the friends. He is rarely not on the road; 
                    he passes his days with his manager and coaches; he returns 
                    in the evening to a hotel room and his Metallica and Offspring 
                    CDs. He was, he told me, in a relationship with a girl which 
                    had been going on for a few months, but he declined to elaborate, 
                    beyond saying, “You need somebody. <br>
                    Otherwise you are too lonely. You get sick of the guys. You 
                    want to see a beautiful girl, to talk, discuss about things, 
                    get angry, make something happen. Otherwise life is boring.” 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Still, life is easier than it was. Safin gestured around him 
                    and was suddenly philosophical. “You want to sat in the five-star 
                    hotels? You have to get here and, believeme, it’s a long way. 
                    Years and years of working hard and traveling the world, and 
                    shitty hotels with no TV and no bathroom. I did all this. 
                    Going to a cafe and eating off the $5 menu. You start with 
                    $100 a week, maybe. I was down to nothing sometimes. I had 
                    to make some good results to make money. Now you come to five-star 
                    hotels, and it’s, “What do you want? Coke? Whisky?” You have 
                    to think about where you’re coming from and how much money 
                    you had before. You cannot forget these things.” <br>
                    <br>
                    Wouldn’t it be easy to lose touch? Safin scolded me for the 
                    suggestion. “You cannot lose touch. <br>
                    There is no chance. A shitty life, you never forget.” How 
                    bad was it for Safin? He was born in Moscow in 1980 to a relatively 
                    prosperous family. His mother, Rausa Islanova, is a former 
                    top-10 Russian player; his father, Mikhail, managed the Spartak 
                    tennis club. (Anna Kournikova used to play there, too.) At 
                    first his mother coached him, but adolescence appears to have 
                    intervened. As Safin once put it, speaking of parents in an 
                    interview with a Russian magazine, “There comes a moment when 
                    you simply start sending them to hell in your mind.”<br>
                    <br>
                    When I asked him to elaborate on this, he said, “My mother 
                    was great, she did agreat job. But the last year, she started 
                    to become a mother. I started to shout at her, Ididn’t respect 
                    her and I didn’t treat her like a coach. Parents have to stay 
                    parents. It never works with a coach who’s a mother or father. 
                    It’s not good for the relationship. I think it’s better to 
                    find the money and pay a coach.” His mother’s solution was 
                    to send him to Spain, where she knew the former director of 
                    Spanish women’s tennis, Maria Pasqual. <br>
                    <br>
                    Pasqual assessed Safin and persuaded a Swiss client to sponsor 
                    him at a tennis academy in Valencia. Safin speaks of this 
                    release as the best thing his parents ever did for him; yet 
                    he gives the impression, too, that he has never quite forgiven 
                    them for it. <br>
                    He knew no Spaniards. He knew no Spanish. He was 14 and utterly 
                    alone. “They left me,their son, to try to survive,” he says, 
                    in a tone which seems to contain both pride and protest.<br>
                    <br>
                    “They left me to find my life.” He thinks it taught his resilience, 
                    gave him “more idea about life outside. Who you can trust, 
                    who you can’t trust. You have to go by yourself in order to 
                    find out what you are in the world.” He was in Spain for four 
                    years, but he claimed that after two of them, at 16, he “knew 
                    what was going on.”<br>
                    <br>
                    He had also begun to enjoy himself. After a spell of lodging 
                    with a married couple and their 25-year-old son, he joined 
                    other students renting rooms in the house of a single woman. 
                    “That was the best time of my life. <br>
                    She didn’t ask me where I’d been and what I was doing. I had 
                    my room- just for me. My music centre, my TV. It was great. 
                    I could do what I wanted.” <br>
                    <br>
                    Do his parents now follow him on the circuit? “I don’t like 
                    them to,” Safin said. “To see the tennis is one thing; but 
                    if they come, the next stop is they want to live your life. 
                    You have bad times, injuries, you’re not nice to them - it’s 
                    better they stay at home and take care of my sister.” (Safin’s 
                    15-year-old sibling, Dinara, is also training to be a tennis 
                    pro. “She wants to be famous,” Safin said. “All the girls, 
                    they want to be famous, right?”) <br>
                    <br>
                    Safin turned professional at 17, beat Andre Agassi during 
                    the French Open in 1998, and won his first tour title a year 
                    later in Boston. Since then he has won seven more titles, 
                    including the US Open victory over Sampras, and has established, 
                    as a kind of trademark, his volatility, which may be little 
                    more calculated than has previously been acknowledged. <br>
                    <br>
                    “You can destroy one racket. You can destroy a chair. But 
                    you can’t destroy a racket and a chair in the same match. 
                    There has to be a limit. One racket. One or two, maybe. Otherwise 
                    this is the tennis of a sick person. People don’t want to 
                    see sick people like me on the court, throwing their rackets 
                    at chairs.” He grinned to indicate that he didn’t mean this 
                    for a minute.<br>
                    <br>
                    The Tuesday after our conversation in Rome, Safin won in the 
                    first round of the Italian Open. Two days later, he was eliminated 
                    in the second round by an unfancied Swiss player. Safin left, 
                    blaming his back, for Hamburg- another tournament, another 
                    chance. <br>
                    <br>
                    Meanwhile, on the proliferating websites and internet chat-rooms 
                    dedicated to Safin, earnest discussion of the player and his 
                    merits continued undaunted. <br>
                    <br>
                    Someone signing themselves “Andreja” had left the following 
                    communication: “he is not gonna merry some ugly hopeful middle-class 
                    fan. he is gonna merry me because i am a good person and i 
                    have the looks as well and lastly i soon will be playing pro
