7-6, 6-0, 6-4 <br>
                  <br>
                  An interview with: MARAT SAFIN</b><br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  THE MODERATOR: Questions for Marat, please. <br>
<br>
Q. How does that victory compare for you with two years ago? 
                    Does this one mean more because it's against Lleyton? <br>
<br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I think right now, yes, because two years ago I 
                  didn't know that I'm gonna finish the year No. 1. I still was 
                  fighting for No. 1. But it was also special, of course, 7-6 
                  in the fifth. <br>
But right now I was in such a bad shape, and for me to win 
                    this tournament and beat in the finals Lleyton in three sets, 
                    I think it couldn't be any better. <br>
<br>
Q. What was the key to the match for you today? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: The key to the match ?? is not much you can 
                    do against Lleyton. You just ?? just you have to play your 
                    game and try to be focus, try to stay calm. Because you know 
                    that he gonna run all over the court and will get all the 
                    balls. He will fight and fight and fight until you break. 
              <br>
                  So if you let him ?? if you show him that you are broken, the 
                  match is finished. Even in the third set, 5-3, Love-40, he played 
                  great tennis. He served well. He played, you know, he played 
                  really good forehand down the line. At 5-4, he hit love?30 on 
                  my serve. That's basically normally the match is starting. <br>
Just I played well. I served well. So it was very important 
                    against Lleyton.<br>
<br>
Q. Were you surprised that maybe in the second set he seemed 
                    to lack a little bit of energy?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: For him? <br>
<br>
Q. Yeah.<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but I made the only break. I felt like 
                    I was playing just perfect, you know. I couldn't miss. I had 
                    so much confidence. I had all the breakpoints, that I had 
                    almost won everything, every breakpoint. <br>
                  I was returning well. I was returning almost every serve. So 
                  it's... I think the second set was just perfect tennis for me. 
                  He didn't expect that, because normally after 7-6, you get early 
                  break by Hewitt. Actually, it was 1-0 for me, then he almost 
                  make me re?break. He had three breakpoints. <br>
                  From there, I made 2-Love, and everything starts. I was playing 
                  well. I was feeling the ball great. That's why the score was 
                  6?Love. <br>
<br>
Q. History tells us players get a liking for a certain stadium 
                    ? once they start playing well, they usually play well there. 
                    You won here twice now. Is that going to help you, even though 
                    the surface will be different? You're going to be back here 
                    in two weeks, but will it help you in the Davis Cup? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: It will be different conditions. I know all 
                    the public that were here with me will, of course, support 
                    the French team. It's normal. Just I cannot do nothing. I 
                    have to play for my country. We want to win also. So it's 
                    already two teams want to win. <br>
So just it will be three days of tough work, but that's sport. 
                    I mean, that's life. Some days you have great days; some days 
                    you have little bit more difficult. <br>
But then I'm enjoying the sport I am playing since I am six. 
                    I'm happy to be here instead of cleaning the streets in Moscow. 
            <br>
<br>
Q. The fact that you haven't won a tournament this year so 
                    far, how much of a relief is that for you to get that now 
                    at the end of the year? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I thought actually that I will not win any tournament 
                    this year. To win in Paris, Bercy, such a big tournament, 
                    it's wonderful ? especially at the end of the season and also 
                    before going to Masters, I think it's even better. <br>
                  (Phone ringing. )<br>
                  Mother again. <br>
What was the question? <br>
<br>
Q. About winning your first tournament. <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, also before the Shanghai, before the Masters, 
                    you need to get some confidence, you know, because you have 
                    seven players, they want to win. They are playing great and 
                    they are tough players. So you need some confidence to get 
                    there and try to do something good, try to make some good 
                    result there. <br>
And also to have the confidence, enough confidence to win 
                    the Davis Cup.<br>
<br>
Q. The fact that you can finish the year No. 2 in front of 
                    Andre, is it special motivation?<br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No. 3, I think it's enough for this year. I 
                    don't want to expect many things, because otherwise if you 
                    don't get there, you gonna be disappointed. <br>
                  But if I will have the opportunity, of course I will fight. 
                  If I will have the opportunity to be No. 2, of course I will 
                  take it. But if not, is nothing ?? is not so bad, still, you 
                  know, win one Super 9 - Masters Series, sorry ? to finish the 
                  year playing the finals of Davis Cup, getting to the Masters, 
                  I think it's good enough. <br>
<br>
Q. You've played, I think, every week since five weeks, I 
                    guess. How do you feel? Are you tired? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Yes, I am. But I have no other choice because 
                    I was trying to get some points. I was trying to get to Shanghai. 
                    That's why I had to play every week, and that's why I try 
                    to play, play and play. <br>
Also to find my game. I wasn't playing really well, so I 
                    was trying to, you know, go from tournament to tournament 
                    and try to, you know, practice and try to find my game back. 
              <br>
Finally, after the week in St. Petersburg that I lost in 
                    the second round, I could make ?? I could win here. <br>
<br>
Q. Do you feel you are the man to beat in Shanghai? Are you 
                    the man to beat? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: No, there is also seven others, you know (smiling)? 
             <br>
<br>
Q. I know. But if not you, who else? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Of course I want. I think everyone want to do 
                    it. Of course I am one of them. I want to win and I want to 
                    take all the money, take all the points and be happy and also 
                    win the Davis Cup, you know? But is not so easy. <br>
But, yes. Yes, I want. I think I can do it. At least I will 
                    have my chances . If I can play like this for in one week, 
                    the way I played here ? today in the finals, and yesterday 
                    , actually during all the week ? you know, just with confidence, 
                    without any pressure, serving well, I think I will have my 
                    chance. <br>
<br>
Q. Where were you when Russia played in '94, '95 Davis Cup 
                    finals? Do you recall anything? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I was practicing, trying to get better, actually, 
                    in Spain. But then was the final, but I was very disappointed 
                    that we lost at home against Sweden and we lost at home against 
                    States on clay. Normally you don't lose to the States at home 
                    on clay. But that's life. I think is the third time, and it's 
                    tough conditions, but there is a chance. <br>
<br>
Q. You seem a very well?informed guy. Is it true that two 
                    weeks ago Ronaldo went to Moscow and was with Yevgeny Kafelnikov? 
                <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: The Russians, we have good life like the French, 
                    you know. We like to enjoy, when others coming. He's playing 
                    not bad actually, after this weekend. Good luck for him. <br>
<br>
Q. You said you found your game back this week. How do you 
                    explain that during the year you find it, you lose it, and 
                    it's not consistent? How do you explain that? <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: I'm not consistent because my tennis game is 
                    like ?? I'm not a player that is waiting for the mistakes 
                    or just, you know, can play from the baseline and can run 
                    from side to side. My tennis is 90 percent of risk. I open 
                    the court, I go down the line. If you don't feel really well, 
                    you don't have any confidence, you miss by like this (indicating 
                    small amount), then you lose the confidence and you are gone 
                    for four weeks. 
					Especially, you know, to come back from playing bad, and 
                    also other players that are playing good. So, you know, they 
                    can see straightaway that you have no confidence, so they 
                    kill you. Until you find your confidence ... <br>
You see how many weeks it took me ? five weeks. Even more 
                    weeks. Even more. <br>
                  You know, since Roland Garros that I make quarterfinals, I couldn't 
                  make anything better. Just semifinals in Moscow. I couldn't 
                  get my confidence back. I just ?? I couldn't. I don't know. 
                  I was looking for it. I was frustrated. I was almost there. 
                  Then I lost again. Almost get there against Kuerten, I lost 
                  7-6 in the third. I lost again. Then some days was terrible 
                  tournament for me. <br>
But finally ? finally ? yes, I have big present from Lleyton 
                    today. <br>
<br>
Q. A couple weeks ago we heard you hired Volkov as a coach. 
                    We noticed he was not here today. Can you clarify the situation. 
              <br>
<br>
MARAT SAFIN: Seriously, I don't know. He was supposed to 
                    come. He couldn't come for some reason. I don't know. Seriously, 
                    I don't know. <br>
Is the end of the year. I'm tired of thinking. I'm tired 
                    of traveling. I'm just ?? I need a real, long vacation, I 
                    think. <br>
<br>
Q. Fabrice Santoro said before the match that this final 
                    was going to be the No. 1 player in the world against the 
                    best player in the world. What do you think about that? <br>
MARAT SAFIN: Thanks, Fabrice. Thanks very much. I still love 
                    him too ? very much. <br>
He's even better, he beat me six times (laughter). <br>
