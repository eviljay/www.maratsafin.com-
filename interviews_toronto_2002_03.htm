                  Marat Safin - Marcelo Rios (CHI) 3-6, 6-3, 7-6 (3).<br>
                  AN INTERVIEW WITH: MARAT SAFIN</b><br>
                  <br>
                  TOUR OFFICIAL: Any questions for Marat? <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: Marat, were you surprised that he played so well? 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: In a way, yes, but I mean the guy he was No. 1 
                  in the world and he's -- he has like five Master series. He 
                  went -- he won, and finals in Australia, and as you can see 
                  he's the most -- I think he's for me the most talented player 
                  in the world. For him tennis is very easy, and he's a great 
                  player, and he's very dangerous, and when he wants to play tennis 
                  and once he -- he has the motivation -- I mean I don't know 
                  him very well. He can play great tennis, and today he was playing 
                  great, and he was very close to beat me. Very, very close. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: Marat, after the first set it looked like he was in 
                  control. You came back the third set. Did you feel you had to 
                  take down to really get past Marcelo? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I just -- I was completely lost in the second set. 
                  I mean when he was set in the breakup (Ph) in the second set 
                  I felt this guy -- it's going to be the end -- and it's going 
                  to be finished very soon, but then I had nothing to lose, and 
                  I was just playing and tried to -- try to do something else, 
                  and I had a couple of great points and then I came back. I won 
                  the second set and then I was down 4-1 in the third and also 
                  I was in the same situation because he was -- he was playing 
                  with a little confidence and also I was just -- just fighting. 
                  Just -- just fighting. Just tried to stay there; tried to serve; 
                  tried to hold on and you can't do much and it was -- it was 
                  okay. I didn't play my best tennis but because it's very difficult 
                  to play against him your best tennis because he is playing very 
                  fast and flat (Ph) balls, so you just have to stay there, and 
                  you have to hold serve and wait for his mistakes. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: (Speaking in French language.) you have won this tournament 
                  in the past. How important is winning to you this year? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Very, very important. If I want to finish the year 
                  -- I just try to finish the year -- No. 1 -- but just fight 
                  for it. I need to win it. I need to do well here. And I'm getting 
                  closer to the final but still it's a long way to go but I think 
                  I have a good chance and at this time I am feeling great, I 
                  am feeling comfortable, and I'm feeling with a lot of confidence 
                  especially the match of today. I did a very difficult match. 
                  I hope that tomorrow is going to be a little bit easier and, 
                  of course, it's very important and, of course, it's nice to 
                  -- it will be nice to win it again two times in a row. <br>
                  <br>
                  TOUR OFFICIAL: Question in the back. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: With three or four calls the umpire decide -- did 
                  that affect -- did that affected your game to your three or 
                  four calls he -- you know -- it was doubted? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah but in every match you have this kind of points 
                  that you just -- you don't know if it's good or bad and there 
                  are some close calls which is -- maybe you can see, but the 
                  chair umpire, he doesn't see it, so, you know, it's just -- 
                  you try -- you try to, you know, to change something but you 
                  know that you can't. It's impossible. You know you try to argue 
                  with the umpire so you, you feel a little bit more fresh afterwards 
                  so you don't challenge them on the court but you speak with 
                  the chair umpire, but they don't get offended because -- that's 
                  good -- because it helps just to argue some times. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: All right. Some times -- some times we have to go 
                  to interviews. We have to watch other things. We don't watch 
                  the whole match so can you tell us how many rackets were broken 
                  today? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Two. Two rackets. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: Any others were close? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: What?<br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: Any others were close, you know?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: No, no, no, no. One was -- what actually --. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: Did you throw them in the air? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah this one and another one that I smashed on 
                  the floor. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: Okay.<br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: Marat, there has been some questions today about that 
                  Russian guy who was arrested or, you know, et cetera, et cetera, 
                  and your name came up and Kafelnikov's name came up and Medvedev's 
                  name came up. <br>
                  What do you know about this guy? Is he your manager? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I don't think it's -- I don't think it's -- sorry 
                  to be rude. I don't think you will understand but it's not our 
                  problem. It's not your problem. It's not -- it's just -- I'll 
                  just -- I don't think it will be nice to talk about it today 
                  and it's not our business actually. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: Do you know him? <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: Is he your manager or --.<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: I just said -- I just said that I'll not answer 
                  this question. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: The player you're playing tomorrow -- Guillermo Canas 
                  knocked off your countryman Yevgeny 6-2, 6-2 pretty convincingly. 
                  Is that a shocking result and what do you expect from him tomorrow? 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: He is playing great. He is playing great tennis 
                  right now -- Canas -- and he was in the finals of Gstaad. He 
                  was in five sets against another Russian guy - Youzhny. And 
                  today he played -- I saw the match. He played great tennis. 
                  I mean 6-2, 6-2. To beat Kafelnikov you must play really well 
                  but at the beginning I think he was a little bit tired of ... 
                  (Inaudible) ... Two tough matches against me and against ... 
                  (Inaudible) ... And also we played yesterday doubles so -- and 
                  was -- and as you can see it was very hot today. And I mean 
                  Canas he used to -- he's used to play with a lot of -- I mean 
                  for him it's normal because he's from Argentina. We don't have 
                  so much, you know, heat in Russia so for us it's difficult. 
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: How difficult is it for you to play in such a condition 
                  because you play all time afternoon or morning session when 
                  the weather was really hot? It was very difficult for us to 
                  watch the game and you have to moving around. <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: It's a part of the job -- part of the job. I mean 
                  it's tough conditions for everybody, for Rios, for me, and it's 
                  difficult to play. Believe me it's very difficult and even there 
                  is even more hot and also just -- but you get used to it. After 
                  a couple of games you get used to it because you have no other 
                  choice. You cannot just walk out of the court and say, &quot;Thank 
                  you very much. I can't play.&quot; you have to play. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: ... (Inaudible) ... Sampras who play -- who plays 
                  each evening. <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: That's Pete Sampras. I cannot tell you against 
                  Pete Sampras. I mean it's -- you cannot touch him. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: All right. Another quick racquet question. <br>
                  You've said in the past that when you smash the rackets, it 
                  is actually a positive thing for you. It fires you up. Did it 
                  work that way today?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Yeah. I need to react somehow. I need to come back 
                  to the match, and I was just on the way to be in the lockroom 
                  very soon so I had to do something. I had to just -- I don't 
                  know. Just I broke the racket and then I -- I don't know. Maybe 
                  my head went in the wrong way and then I broke a couple of rackets, 
                  and I came back to the match, so I think it, it helps me some 
                  times. <br>
                  <br>
                  REPORTER: On the the way you see Marcelo Rios playing today 
                  do you think he can come back to the top ten?<br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: If he wants always. Whenever he wants. Tennis I 
                  think it's too easy for him. Too easy. <br>
                  <br>
                  TOUR OFFICIAL: Anybody else? No. <br>
                  <br>
                  MARAT SAFIN: Thank you. <br>
                  <br>
