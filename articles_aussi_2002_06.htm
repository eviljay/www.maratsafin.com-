                  Wednesday, 23 January, 2002<br>
                  <br>
                  No.9 seed Marat Safin has advanced to the semi finals, after 
                  his quarter final opponent, the unseeded Wayne Ferreira, retired 
                  injured during their match on Rod Laver Arena, Wednesday.<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin, the 2000 U.S Open winner, was leading 5-2 in the first 
                  set (after breaking the South African's serve twice), when Ferreira 
                  waved the white flag and stopped due to an abdominal strain.<br>
                  <br>
                  The match lasted 28 minutes, which Safin wasn't complaining 
                  about. &quot;I think it's great for me. I don't have to spend 
                  too much energy on the court and I can save my energy for the 
                  semi finals.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I just ask (Ferreira) 'What is going on? What is the reason? 
                  I feel sorry,&quot; said the big Russian. &quot;He couldn't 
                  run anymore. He was too tired, played two five setters.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;I'm feeling well and I want to have the opportunity to 
                  win. I'm doing well, so I would love to win this tournament 
                  and I am closer and closer to the final,&quot; said Safin. <br>
                  <br>
                  30-year-old Ferreira, the oldest remaining player in the singles 
                  tournament, had played two consecutive five set matches coming 
                  into this quarter final clash with Safin, who at 22 years of 
                  age, is the youngest player left in the men's draw. <br>
                  <br>
                  In contrast, Safin's first real test had come in his fourth 
                  round encounter with former world No.1 Pete Sampras, which he 
                  won in four tight sets. It was the first set he'd dropped all 
                  tournament. &quot;Sometimes you have to work a little bit more 
                  than normal, like I did against Pete. It was a great match and 
                  I deserved to win. So today (winning so easily) was a present,&quot; 
                  said Safin.<br>
                  <br>
                  Ferreira later admitted that the injury was a recurring one, 
                  but denied it was because of his age. &quot;It's not because 
                  I'm older. I've had this before. I tore it about nine years 
                  ago, and there's a lot of scar tissue in there. It's the same 
                  spot that keeps flaring up. It's telling me something, my body 
                  is not used to playing this much. I just abused myself.&quot; 
                  Ferreira added that he had twice withdrawn from the French Open 
                  with a torn stomach muscle.<br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;The way I'd been playing I felt I had chance, so it's 
                  a little bit disappointing. The thing about today is not really 
                  the fact that I've hurt myself and pulled out, it's the fact 
                  that I couldn't go out there and really fight hard. I don't 
                  mind losing as long as I know that the other guy has to fight 
                  to win. <br>
                  <br>
                  &quot;It's disappointing to give it to him. He probably could 
                  have beaten me anyway, but I like to go out fighting,&quot; 
                  said Ferreira, adding that Safin &quot;has a great chance to 
                  win. If he plays at his best he's almost unbeatable.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  The South African then gave an insight into his game plan today. 
                  &quot;For him, the mental side is his weakest. I was hoping 
                  today - he had such a good game against Sampras - I think he 
                  concentrated so hard and focused so hard that I was hoping he 
                  wouldn't be able to do it twice in a row.&quot;<br>
                  <br>
                  Safin will meet the winner of the Tommy Haas v Marcelo Rios 
                  match, scheduled for Wednesday evening. &quot;Everybody knows 
                  that he (Rios) is very talented. But he doesn't like to run 
                  - so you have to move him a lot and just to stay with him. Against 
                  Haas is the same thing. Just to stay and fight and run, and 
                  just take your chances,&quot; said Safin.<br>
