                  First Davis Cup Trophy comes with the help of two singles wins 
                  by Safin and five-set thriller by Youzhny.</em><br>
                  <br>
                  Russia pulled off a historic and stunning victory over France 
                  in the Davis Cup Final Sunday at the Palais Omnisports Paris 
                  Bercy to win its first Davis Cup trophy.<br>
<br>
The most unlikely hero of the weekend was 20-year-old Russian 
                    Mikhail Youzhny, who was a ball boy the last time Russia played 
                    in the Davis Cup final back in 1995. <br>
<br>
Substituting for veteran Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who was overcome 
                    with exhaustion following his five-set doubles match on Saturday, 
                    Youzhny came from two sets down to defeat Paul-Henri Mathieu 
                    in the fifth and deciding match, stunning the crowd of 15,000 
                    that included former Russian President Boris Yeltsin. <br>
<br>
French President Jacques Chirac also attended matches during 
                    the three-day competition. <br>
<br>
It was a fitting finish to a roller coaster weekend of tennis 
                    and drama played out on the special red clay court set up 
                    in the Palais Omnisports, where just over a month ago Marat 
                    Safin was crowned champion at the BNP Paribas Masters. <br>
<br>
Safin would again find success indoors in Paris this weekend. 
                    His opening match victory over Mathieu got Russia going early 
                    and his victory over Sebastien Grosjean on Sunday started 
                    Russia back on its comeback after being down 2-1 following 
                    the doubles match on Saturday. <br>
<br>
France had history on its side. In every final since 1978, 
                    the team winning the doubles point has gone on to win the 
                    Davis Cup. France had also never lost a Davis Cup Final when 
                    leading going into the final day. <br>
<br>
But history didn't matter to Safin or Youzhny, who became 
                    the first man in the 102 years of the Davis Cup competition 
                    to come back from a two set deficit in the fifth match of 
                    the final. It was also Youzhny's first meaningful Davis Cup 
                    victory in his career. He was 1-4 before the match with his 
                    only victory coming in a meaningless dead rubber. <br>
<br>
&quot;We decided to put Mikhail because Yevgeny was tired 
                    after the doubles,&quot; said Safin. &quot;He couldn't play 
                    today, so we decided to put the young player. Why not?&quot; 
                <br>
<br>
&quot;Probably my ego was saying that I should play, but 
                    realistically I felt like he [Youzhny] was going to give the 
                    best effort than I could,&quot; said Kafelnikov. &quot;You 
                    know, lately he was playing well, and I wasn't.&quot; <br>
<br>
Perhaps making the decision easier for Russian coach Shamil 
                    Tarpishev has been Youzhny's solid play this season. Last 
                    month, he reached the final at the St. Petersburg Open and 
                    earlier this year captured his first ATP title at the Stuttgart 
                    Outdoors. <br>
<br>
For Safin, the win ranks up with some of his best tennis 
                    moments. &quot;I'm so happy, I'm so glad. I cannot describe 
                    what I'm feeling right now. It's just something that is just 
                    so great, it's the best.&quot; <br>
<br>
Youzhny himself seemed shocked by the moment. &quot;I don't 
                    understand what's happens. I just know we're winning. I was 
                    very glad after the match.&quot; <br>
<br>
For the team veteran, 28-year-old Kafelnikov, a few days 
                    of reflection are needed before he announces whether he will 
                    continue to play professionally. The former World No. 1 and 
                    two-time Grand Slam champion had said this fall that he would 
                    retire if he helped his country win its first Davis Cup trophy. 
                  <br>
<br>
But he was non-committal after the match. &quot;Let me explain 
                    once again. It's very enjoyable moment for me right now. I 
                    do respect what I said before. Like I told you, the final 
                    decision will be made throughout next week.&quot; <br>
