                    <br>
                    THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. King of Boston, why are you playing these matches when 
                    you're injured?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I think if you want me honest, to be honest with 
                    you, I think it's the rules what they make, ATP. We have to 
                    make -- we have to play all the Super 9s - sorry, Masters 
                    Series called now. Otherwise, you have no points. You have 
                    one point and, I mean, you have to try. So that's why I'm 
                    playing. I don't -- even they told me is maybe problem for 
                    the rib, can be broken. Actually the muscle is okay, everything 
                    is okay, but I was speaking with Fabrice Santoro and Gustavo 
                    Kuerten, they just told me, &quot;Listen, check again, because 
                    maybe it can be the rib which is little bit broken or something 
                    happen with it.&quot; Because they have the same story. So 
                    that's why I'm playing here. That's why I tried. I came to 
                    Indian Wells and here. I have to try. Actually, it's little 
                    bit -- you saw the match, so you know how I feel. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Is there any sense that the reason you played was because 
                    you owe it to tennis or you owe it to the fans that came to 
                    watch you?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: It's a difficult question. I mean, I think you 
                    guys -- I don't have to explain to you because there are some 
                    things I cannot tell you; you have to think about your own 
                    why I played, why I came here. You think about it. (Smiling.) 
                    I think is not so difficult to understand.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. How painful was it out there?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I mean, I couldn't serve more than 100 miles 
                    per hour. 98 was my fastest serve, and I make an ace.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What will you do now?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: What I will do now? I will just come back to 
                    Europe, try to get some treatment because it cannot go like 
                    this because I cannot serve. I mean, you cannot play against 
                    these guys without serve. It's little bit -- is ridiculous 
                    what I make today on the court because you always under pressure, 
                    you not comfortable with -- I know because all -- you think 
                    all the time they're all here, you know, the guys putting 
                    pressure on you, he's serving, he's doing everything. I'm 
                    just trying to put inside the ball and make the point. Is 
                    not my game. Is difficult for me to build a point because 
                    I don't have free points. The other guy, when he is -- he 
                    can make few good serves and the game is over, so he doesn't 
                    give me any chances. It's little bit tough.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. The doctors told you if you rest and treat it, approximately 
                    how long will it take to get rid of the problem?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Up to one month.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. One month?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Even more. So that's why I'm telling that it's 
                    little bit -- I don't think it's correct. I think they have 
                    to check the rule again, the guys from ATP. Because right 
                    now I was injured, right, they made me play Indian Wells and 
                    Key Biscayne. So really is not good for my back, right? So 
                    if I will not play, I will be okay, ready for Davis Cup or 
                    at least for Monte Carlo. Now, I don't know when I am going 
                    to be ready. Now I am not sure. So I think that the guys, 
                    the people from ATP, they have to think a little bit about 
                    -- they have to put themselves in my situation. My situation 
                    now is not of the best. I lost to -- I have two points, two 
                    Super 9s, Masters Series, I don't know if I'm going to be 
                    okay for Monte Carlo. It's already three points. The guys, 
                    I'm far from the Top 10.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. If you had decided not to play, I hate to say the difference 
                    between one point and zero points, did you consider at any 
                    point not playing at all?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: That's why I told you to think a little bit about 
                    it. You ask can them why I played. I don't want to explain, 
                    because I think it's -- you understand this why I don't want 
                    to explain. Ask the guys a question, &quot;Why?&quot; If you 
                    change the rules, you ask the guys from ATP why I played. 
                    They explain you, very simple. Because I don't want to get 
                    in this -- because maybe it's some of you guys, they will 
                    not understand this. And you will look at me like different 
                    view. I don't -- I like you guys. I hope you like me. I don't 
                    want a big fight here. But, yes, I'm angry. I'm angry with 
                    ATP. I'm angry with all the guys, you know, who are working 
                    there because I have this thing because they don't think about 
                    me. I think they don't care what's going on with me, what's 
                    gonna happen with me, if I will be okay in one month. And 
                    the guys, I mean it's -- I'm disappointed because if I'm injured, 
                    I'm coming there to their office, &quot;Listen, guys. I'm 
                    injured. My rib is broken. I can't play. Leave me alone, I'll 
                    go back home, I'll try to get the treatment and come to Key 
                    Biscayne in perfect conditions and make the big show for the 
                    people.&quot; I think it's more fun for people watching me 
                    play 100 percent than to see Safin at 20 percent on the court 
                    suffering from everything, like handicapped. I have the strength 
                    on my ass even. I mean, I'm just -- I'm coming in with this 
                    really ridiculous belt there and the guy, he cannot play. 
                    He has to go to hospital. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. I don't understand this. I mean, if you're hurt, you don't 
                    -- you just decide, &quot;I'm not playing,&quot; and that's 
                    it. Who tells you? No one puts you in handcuffs, takes you 
                    to the court and tells you you have to play?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Ask them. I'll call somebody from ATP and ask 
                    them why I came here. They'll explain, I promise, they'll 
                    explain to you why. Even him, he knows. Him, he knows why 
                    I am here. Really, the guy, he knows why I came here. Why 
                    I stayed here from Indian Wells in Miami. He knows why. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You had such a great year last year. Is this a problem 
                    for you starting this year with this kind of difficulty when 
                    you're looking ahead to things you have to defend, especially 
                    like the US Open title?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I think, listen, the health is the most important 
                    thing. I think, no, it's just because, I don't know, I don't 
                    feel healthy. It's just you have problems, problems each time 
                    coming out. And it's, I don't know, you don't -- I don't feel 
                    comfortable. I don't think it's -- it's difficult. Because 
                    if you will play like this, especially if you have somebody 
                    that push you to come to tournaments.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. I hate to change the subject, I have to ask you, when you 
                    were a kid you played in Valencia. Did you practice with Juan 
                    Carlos Ferrero there?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, I practice.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. A lot?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Not a lot. Few times.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Were you good buddies there?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I mean, he's in different city. We know each 
                    other. (Inaudible) But we're not family. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. The match was very close actually by score towards the 
                    end. Did you think you had a chance to win it?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, I do. After match he just tell me, &quot;I 
                    am happy that you lose, that you lost.&quot; Because, I mean, 
                    if I would win today I can't play tomorrow. I mean, against 
                    Escude. I don't want to say Balcells is not a good player, 
                    but they have guys like Escude, they have more experience. 
                    They already know how to play against me. Especially they 
                    know what happen in my back. I mean, it's... <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Did you use a Dunlap today?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No, it was a head. . <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. You didn't break any, did you?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. We've asked everybody else about Venus Williams. She had 
                    a twinge in her knee, she pulled out. You're dying and won't 
                    pull out. How do you feel about that situation?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I'm very happy being in Miami. (Laughter.) Spending 
                    time, at least I can spend some time on the beach, not on 
                    the tennis court. So if you want to know, I'm telling you 
                    all the time why I came here, ask questions for ATP, okay?<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. What were you expecting out of this year? You go back to 
                    January, you say, &quot;We're starting over.&quot; What in 
                    your mind was your expectation?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I mean, in Australia if I go back to January, 
                    I mean, of course it's difficult. I didn't expect big results 
                    from Australia because I had a very long year. We finished 
                    the season second or third week of -- second week of December. 
                    I have two weeks of rest, you have no time for preparation 
                    for next season. You're not 100 percent. I wasn't 100 percent 
                    in Australia. I still make fourth round, but is nothing actually. 
                    And of course I was getting better and better, I start to 
                    play better and better. Then I get injured. So from the point 
                    where could be like in Top 10, fighting for No. 1, you know, 
                    in the Race, now I'm 18 just because of two tournaments. And 
                    it's make difference, you know. Now I'm out of shape, out 
                    of confidence. If I will not be injured during the bye, probably 
                    I would be close, you know, three, four, fighting for No. 
                    1. Now I am out of game, and I'm little bit disappointed because 
                    all these things are happening to me with ATP.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. So do you think Venus Williams is a good example to be 
                    set, where if you're hurt, no pressure can force you to play? 
                    If you play when you're hurt, you can get hurt more?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, right. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Then you're not in vie for the race of the Top 10. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, it's, you know, it's different story. You 
                    don't compare me to Venus. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. I'm just saying about a stand, &quot;I'm not playing if 
                    I'm hurt. That's it.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: They will give you answer why.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. I'm asking you. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I don't want to talk about this, these things 
                    because -- not because I have nothing against you. Just -- 
                    it's not -- the thing that I think ATP, if they have enough 
                    balls to tell -- to talk about this, they gonna say. If they 
                    don't have balls, so... One day you know it.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. If you had to do it over, would you play?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Huh?<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Would you play hurt again?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No. I hope not. <br>
                    <br>
