                  By Ronald Atkin in Barcelona<br>
                  <a href="http://sport.independent.co.uk/tennis/" target="_blank">sport.independent.co.uk</a><br>
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  The Real Club de Tenis in Barcelona's swish Pedralbes district 
                  is one of the classier locations in a sport which does not do 
                  seedy. So, on a gentle spring day by the Mediterranean, the 
                  outdoor eating area of the players' lounge was a delightful 
                  spot to be. In the aftermath of victory, Marat Safin was certainly 
                  lapping it up, relishing his first tournament back after a string 
                  of injuries.<br>
<br>
Safin had been out for three weeks with a sprained ankle, 
                    the third time this year he has been stricken Ц four, actually, 
                    if you include the bout of food poisoning which also flattened 
                    the 6ft 4in Russian. In his first event, Sydney in January, 
                    Safin pulled out in the third round with a strained shoulder. 
                    He recovered in time for the Australian Open, only to damage 
                    wrist tendons in his opening match and eventually default 
                    in the third round.<br>
<br>
A month later Safin came back and played three events, culminating 
                    in a quarter-final at Indian Wells, before going over on the 
                    ankle first time out at the Miami tournament. When he suffered 
                    a recurrence while practising in Buenos Aires for Russia's 
                    Davis Cup quarter-final with Argentina, it was time to head 
                    home to Moscow for treatment and rest.<br>
<br>
Barcelona has been the first stop along the clay-court path 
                    to next month's French Open, the Grand Slam where Safin rocketed 
                    into the reckoning as an 18-year-old in 1998 by knocking out 
                    Andre Agassi and the defending champion, Gustavo Kuerten. 
                    This week he plays Valen-cia, then Rome and Hamburg, before 
                    Paris. &quot;I need to get physically and mentally fit, get 
                    some confidence back, so I can go strong to Roland Garros, 
                    because I want to do well there,'' Safin said, sipping a fizzy 
                    orange drink straight from the can. &quot;But right now my 
                    main aim is not to get injured any more. I am a little bit 
                    afraid of running and sliding because the ankle was so painful. 
                    But I am not a person who runs a lot, who spends a lot of 
                    energy on the court. If I am mentally OK, if nothing is bothering 
                    me and I want to play, then it is fine.''<br>
<br>
Safin's attitude, or rather lack of it, has been a matter 
                    of discussion and concern, not least to himself. It may appear 
                    churlish to knock someone who briefly became world No 1, who 
                    has won a Grand Slam and 10 other titles and who helped his 
                    nation to Davis Cup victory last year, but Marat himself conceded: 
                    &quot;I can't be happy with what I have achieved. But I am 
                    still only 23 years old, though some people say: 'He's already 
                    23'. But I have hopefully seven more years to play, so I think 
                    I can improve.''<br>
<br>
Seven of those titles, including the US Open, were annexed 
                    in 2000. The following year he won two, and in 2002 just one. 
                    The US victory, when he demolished Pete Sampras in the final, 
                    is understandably his top memory: &quot;I was in the right 
                    place at the right moment. God came to me, patted me on the 
                    head and said: 'You will win the glory'.<br>
<br>
&quot;But the French Open is the tournament I really love 
                    and enjoy playing. I feel at home there and always play well 
                    in Paris. I won the indoor title twice at Bercy, where we 
                    also won the Davis Cup last December, and I have been in the 
                    quarters and semis at Roland Garros. It's emotional, the city 
                    is so good you want to play tennis. And of course afterwards 
                    you go and have a good dinner, Champs Elysйes, it's nice.''<br>
<br>
But can he win there? &quot;Why not? I am not one of the 
                    favourites, they will be Kuerten, Ferrero and Moya, but I 
                    can push them.''<br>
<br>
Because he feels grass is his weakest surface, Safin does 
                    not rate himself among the favourites for Wimbledon, either. 
                    But he will prepare carefully by entering the Stella Artois 
                    event at Queen's Club and the Dutch grass tournament in Rosmalen. 
                    &quot;But Wimbledon is not the tournament I love,'' he admitted. 
                    &quot;I don't like how they treat the players. There are small 
                    things that don't cost them anything and they make such a 
                    big deal out of it. If they treat us this way, well, we have 
                    to treat them the same. We want to be respected, the way we 
                    respect Wimbledon, even if it is not the best Grand Slam on 
                    earth.''<br>
<br>
Having seen off five coaches over the past three years, Safin 
                    is now travelling with a former tour pro, Denis Golovanov, 
                    who, he says, &quot;is my best friend, a guy I trust who knows 
                    what I need. He has known me since I was 11 and I believe 
                    in him. I don't need a coach always telling me what to do, 
                    always wanting to change something.''<br>
<br>
Tony Pickard, who acted as adviser when Safin got to Wimbledon's 
                    last eight in 2001, is the sole coach to earn plaudits. &quot;Tony 
                    is the one guy who understood me, he found out really soon 
                    what I need. The others weren't coaches. I don't need to change 
                    things in my game, it is good enough. What I need to improve 
                    is my mental ability, to learn not to frustrate myself. They 
                    always want to change the player. They say: 'Now I am here, 
                    you will do what I say'. Why?<br>
<br>
&quot;I am also a person, I have been on the tour since I 
                    was 18, so I am not somebody from kindergarten who has no 
                    clue. I know what I want, I know what I need to beat other 
                    players, but something is missing. This is something I need 
                    to sort out, but I am quite responsible for myself.<br>
<br>
&quot;Good times will come,'' Safin forecast, with a final 
                    swig from the can. &quot;If I stay fit my confidence will 
                    come back. I am going to be dangerous this year.'' <br>
