                    MODERATOR: Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen. Marat Safin. 
                    First questions in English.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Are you very frustrated? Stupid question? <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yes, a little bit, because the second round, 
                    I was playing quite well the first match, and suddenly I just 
                    didn't felt like -- I couldn't find my game today since the 
                    beginning of the match. I lost my serve. Whatever I did, it 
                    was wrong. You know, it was wrong decision. I didn't felt 
                    like -- you know, I couldn't play. I tried, just I was missing 
                    everything. Of course, it's frustrating. I could play some 
                    good tennis here. Unfortunately, is bad day at the office. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. But you know the reason why you didn't find your game?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Bad day. I mean, it's like it happens. It happens. 
                    You try to do everything as possible, and you just miss by 
                    centimeters all the time, very important points. You cannot 
                    do anything. You have to try. You have to try very hard. And 
                    I tried. I had my opportunity in the fourth set to make him 
                    a break. Suddenly the ball was on the line. The linesman, 
                    he called it out; we replayed the point. Basically it was 
                    two sets, two and two, so fifth set. Definitely I will play 
                    much better in fifth set. But it happens. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Did that call unsettle you at all? Obviously you looked 
                    rather upset. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, because, I mean, you're trying, you're 
                    trying very badly. You are struggling, you are not playing 
                    great tennis. You try to give everything. You fight if you 
                    are not playing really well. You have opportunity, they don't 
                    let you win; so then of course you get frustrated. Of course, 
                    it's upset you. What you can do? I'm frustrated, but it was 
                    okay. I think he played a great match still, and he was beating 
                    me from the baseline. And just he was much better than me 
                    today.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. In Paris you played him, as well. You had your hands full. 
                    Before the match then you said, &quot;He's very, very good 
                    player.&quot; Are you intimidated by him in some way, him 
                    being so short and all?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Yeah, but has nothing to do with whether you're 
                    short or not. He has beautiful hands. I mean, he can do many 
                    things. He has beautiful touch. You know, he has a feel, you 
                    know, on the ball. And he's moving very good. Just he's fast 
                    and he has great anticipation. He's a player that you have 
                    to beat him. You cannot just come on the court and say, &quot;You 
                    are small, I am big, I have to win.&quot; It's not like this. 
                    He's smart, he's great, he's moving. He can do many things. 
                    So it was tough match. I didn't play well, and he beat me. 
                    But I was concentrated. It's always tough to play against 
                    him. Even in Roland Garros I played. It was five sets. He 
                    almost beat me there. So is a guy, a serious guy, that you 
                    have to play with him.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Experts say they wish you to be more going forward, approaching 
                    the net. BobBrett say you would have greatest chances on grass 
                    if you were to come forward a lot more, then you'd be one 
                    of the best players on the surface. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: I mean, I am still okay. I am satisfied with 
                    my game. <br>
                    You know, it's easy to say. Of course, from outside everybody's 
                    much smarter than inside. Of course, I can say many things, 
                    that Sampras will win another five Grand Slams, Marc Rosset 
                    will come back to the Top 10. It's not so easy inside the 
                    court when you're talking outside. Go and play, try. I don't 
                    think it's so easy. Of course, I know my mistakes, when I 
                    need to improve. But it's not so easy like it's when you are 
                    talking.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. I don't know if you know it was the 80th anniversary of 
                    the Centre Court. How do you view the traditions of Wimbledon? 
                    How do you see them?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Actually, I didn't know it was anniversary today. 
                    Yeah, true? <br>
                    <br>
                    MODERATOR: This year. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: So bad luck for me. Was good day for Wimbledon, 
                    but bad day for me (smiling). <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Generally, how do you see the tradition? Do you feel it? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Of course, you can feel how special it is to 
                    play, you know, in Wimbledon. Even starting from you have 
                    to wear the white clothes, and be nice and polite, don't hit 
                    the racquet. It's for some people, it's nice. You have to 
                    be polite and all these things. For us, for the people who 
                    are a little bit more emotional on the court like me, it's 
                    difficult, you know, to be quiet - because you need to get 
                    upset, because it helps you sometimes, you know, to come back. 
                    But it's okay. I will learn one day. But, of course, it's 
                    always nice. It's nice to be here. It's nice to play on grass. 
                    It's already special to play also on grass. It's so many years. 
                    It's so many years that this tournament is very special. I 
                    am proud to be here, proud to be seeded No. 2, proud to play 
                    here for four years already. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q. Were you perhaps more nervous than for the first round 
                    because of the close game in Paris?<br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: No, it has nothing to do with Paris because Paris 
                    was a different surface, was clay, different game, different 
                    style of game. <br>
                    It's just you can feel it. I came to the court, I made the 
                    first game, I made two double-faults, and I didn't felt really 
                    good because I was not hitting the ball really, really clean, 
                    and I didn't felt -- but he had so much confidence. I tried. 
                    I lose the first game. He start to play much better. Then 
                    I was struggling. I try to make rebreak. I had my chances, 
                    but I was missing all the time. I was missing, but not much, 
                    but it was enough, you know. Too many mistakes.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q. That's what I mean, maybe he knew from Paris that it was 
                    possible to do something against you. <br>
                    <br>
                    MARAT SAFIN: Of course, there is something to do against anybody, 
                    even Pete Sampras. He just lost to Bastl. That's why I said 
                    many times more, the tennis is more or less equal. Any player 
                    can beat any player. As you can see Pete, Roger Federer yesterday. 
                    The people, they can play tennis - short, long, big, fat, 
                    whatever; everybody can play tennis. Everybody knows how to 
                    do it. So every time you go to the court, you have to be prepared. 
                    Of course, you have bad days, you have good days, you have 
                    days that you are missing everything, the other day just you 
                    playing your best tennis. But you don't have to get too upset 
                    when you lose, not to be very happy when you win. Just stay 
                    calm, play your match, try your best. If you lose, okay, &quot;Thank 
                    you very much, you were better than me today. Well done, good 
                    luck for the rest of the tournament.&quot; You cannot do much. 
                    You cannot start thinking, &quot;What I did wrong? What I 
                    did good?&quot; It happens, that's it, it's over. <br>
                    <br>
