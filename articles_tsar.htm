                    In September 10, 2000, in a devastating display of poise and 
                    power, 20-year- old Marat Safin unseated Pete Sampras to become 
                    the first Russian ever to win the US Open and the youngest 
                    Grand Slam winner since Sampras took his first Grand Slam 
                    title (of 13 to date) at the US Open in 1990. Indeed, the 
                    victory put Safin front and center of a new generation of 
                    tennis stars; in Russia he was proclaimed &quot;The New Tsar 
                    of Russian Tennis.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    When Safin's last passing shot breezed by Sampras, the 6'4&quot; 
                    Russian raised his hand aloft in triumph, smiled a radiant 
                    smile and looked up to the sky, as if seeking confirmation 
                    from heaven that his victory was not a dream. He kneeled down 
                    on the hard green court, kissed the ground, then clambered 
                    up into the stands to embrace the handful of supporters who 
                    had come to cheer him on. Safin had been singularly calm and 
                    calculating in his straight- set (6:4, 6:3, 6:3) obliteration 
                    of Sampras. He made very few forced errors and was in complete 
                    command of the court, repeatedly driving passing shots down 
                    the line and never letting Sampras get a toe-hold at the net. 
                    In short, Safin out Sampras-ed Sampras. No former champion 
                    had lost so badly and so quickly at the US Open since Jimmy 
                    Connor was routed by Manual Orantes (6:4, 6:3, 6:3) in 1975.<br>
                    <br>
                    Marat Safin is a new breed of Russian tennis player. Tall, 
                    handsome, affable and easy-going, he is a sports marketer's 
                    dream. He doesn't grouse like Yevgeny Kafelnikov (who the 
                    press has dubbed &quot;Mr. Lemon&quot; for his cool demeanor), 
                    or has Safin been smitten with stardom like Anna Kurnikova 
                    (who has yet to win a single tournament in her career). <br>
                    <br>
                    Safin is also a new type of Russian sportsman. His experience 
                    is a dean break from the &quot;big brother&quot; sports machine 
                    of the Soviet era (whereas Kafelnikov enjoyed all the perks 
                    of this era, yet got to &quot;privatize&quot; himself when 
                    the new reality manifested itself). This is not to say Safin 
                    struggled through dire straits. His mother, Rauza Islanova, 
                    a former Soviet tennis player, was a coach at Moscow's Spartak 
                    in Sokolniki (training, among others, Russia's new female 
                    tennis prodigy, Yelena Dementieva), which meant court time 
                    was always easy to come by. <br>
                    <br>
                    But Rauza taught her son to work hard. She trained Marat herself 
                    until he was 13, then she and her husband, Mikhail (also a 
                    sportsman, he was a Moscow track and field champion), found 
                    a sponsor and sent Marat for training to Spain, under coach 
                    Rafael Mensua. <br>
                    <br>
                    Such a long separation from one's family at such an early 
                    age can surely not have been easy. Mikhail said he believes 
                    that Marat realized his potential and forged his character 
                    when he was forced to live on his own. But the reason for 
                    training abroad was clear: his mother's coaching was no longer 
                    sufficient and, in the early 1990s, Russia's sports machine 
                    was in a shambles; the only way to get world- class training 
                    was to go abroad. As Marat said in 1999, &quot;if I had not 
                    left Russia for abroad I would probably have stopped playing 
                    tennis by now&quot;-a reality many promising Russian juniors 
                    without sponsors had to face. <br>
                    <br>
                    Cut loose in Spain, Marat of course fell victim to adolescent 
                    impulses. He came to love night clubs and loves to party. 
                    &quot;When they organize parties at tournaments, Marat goes,&quot; 
                    his father said. &quot;In Spain, nightlife for adolescents 
                    is a given. And since Marat grew up in Spain, he got used 
                    to it. He relishes club life-but not to the detriment of tennis, 
                    of course.&quot; <br>
                    Rauza also recalled how Marat bought himself a heavy gold 
                    chain, boasting that it was heavier than Andrei Medvedev's 
                    (the Ukrainian tennis player). Rauza cringed. &quot;Marat,&quot; 
                    she said, &quot;I also like gold, but not in such quantities.&quot; 
                    &quot;It was such a childish purchase&quot; Mikhail said. 
                    Then, when he was 15, he pierced his ear. &quot;Now they are 
                    even piercing navels, but back then it was a shock. We were 
                    so upset,&quot; Mikhail recalled. <br>
                    <br>
                    But the earring shortly disappeared. Marat was growing up 
                    quickly. By 1997, he had turned pro and, over the course of 
                    the year had moved from number 450 in the world to 194. By 
                    1998 he was the ATP's &quot;Player to Watch.&quot; A strong 
                    performance in the Davis Cup against US veteran Jim Courier 
                    put Safin on everyone's radar screen. Then Safin stole the 
                    show at Rolland-Garros 1998, where he defeated Andre Agassi 
                    and the then defending champion Gustavo Kuerten. <br>
                    <br>
                    In the fall of 1999, Marat was a full-- fledged member of 
                    the Russian National Davis Cup Team and was dubbed &quot;Savior 
                    of Russia&quot; for helping his team win the decisive fifth 
                    point against Slovakia. At the end of 1999, he was ranked 
                    25th in the world. <br>
                    <br>
                    But the beginning of 2000 was disastrous for the young Russian. 
                    He was ousted in the first round in five consecutive tournaments. 
                    At the year's first Grand Slam event, the Australian Open, 
                    Safin was fined $2000 for not giving his best effort in an 
                    opening round match in which he lost in straight sets. It 
                    all made him question his career choice: &quot;Last March, 
                    in Indianapolis, I decided that if I don't finish the year 
                    in the top 100, I will quit tennis,&quot; Safin recalled after 
                    his US Open victory. <br>
                    <br>
                    Thankfully, Safin's tailspin was halted. He prevailed upon 
                    his friend and fellow tennis star, Andrei Chesnokov, to coach 
                    him. Chesnokov helped Safin get his spirit back in the game 
                    and his anger out (Safin is notorious for smashing racquets 
                    on court-48 in 1999 and 36 in 2000). Chesnokov also taught 
                    Marat to stop trying to hit every ball as if it were his last, 
                    to focus on accuracy and hitting the ball long. The effect 
                    was almost immediate. Safin pulled out a string of victories 
                    in Barcelona, Mallorca and Hamburg (runner-up). By the end 
                    of May he had climbed to number 14 in the world. &quot;I began 
                    to think with my head and everything went normal,&quot; Safin 
                    said. <br>
                    <br>
                    Russian Davis Cup Captain Shamil Tarpischev said, &quot;Marat 
                    found himself in a psychological pit. It has happened to many. 
                    It's one thing when you are a nobody; you have nothing to 
                    lose. It's a different thing when you already have something. 
                    You know: fame, money, attention from the girls. To an inexperienced 
                    guy, it seems that once you have achieved it, you will never 
                    lose it. In order to learn how to defend one's achievements, 
                    one must have character, time and experienced people who can 
                    suggest what to do and how. Safin overcame the crisis quickly, 
                    though painfully.&quot; <br>
                    Marat split later this year with Chesnokov, due to some personal 
                    differences. Another friend and coach, Alexander Volkov, stepped 
                    in to help Safin prepare for hard surface tournaments. He 
                    then took the Masters tourney in Toronto, where he beat Sampras 
                    for the first time, in the quarterfinals. Now sixth in the 
                    world, Safin was ready to vie for his first Grand Slam tournament. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    But then, winning a Grand Slam tourney requires consistent 
                    play for two weeks. There is no room for on-court tantrums. 
                    While Safin is no McEnroe, engaging in verbal abuse of umpires, 
                    line judges and fellow opponents, he is very hard on himself. 
                    As Reuters observer Bill Berkot wrote, &quot;The immensely 
                    talented 20-year-old with thunderous strokes has been singled 
                    out as one of the likely leaders of the next generation-poised 
                    to take over the game when Sampras and Agassi decide to call 
                    it quits. But he has often been his own worst enemy, prone 
                    to bursts of uncontrolled anger and prolonged concentration 
                    lapses.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    Luckily, in New York, Safin was in control of his game. And 
                    when he is in control, he can be a devastating force. &quot;I 
                    grew up ..&quot; Safin said. &quot;I started to practice with 
                    the head, not with the strokes, and everything came.&quot; 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    After his US Open victory, Safin hit the US talk show circuit, 
                    including Charlie Rose and Late Night with David Letterman. 
                    Showing wit and charm, he bantered with Letterman and gave 
                    as good as he got: <br>
                    <br>
                    Marat: ...the problem is that you have to pay after you break 
                    the racquet. (Laughter) You have to pay a fine. <br>
                    <br>
                    Dave: Oh, they fine you for that? <br>
                    <br>
                    Marat: No, no, they say `thank you, you are doing well: (Cheers 
                    and applause) <br>
                    <br>
                    Safin's quick wit has long earned him the love of the Russian 
                    press. Not surprisingly, when, on the heels of his victory 
                    in New York, Safin won the President's Cup in Tashkent, Russian 
                    observers, who have had a love-hate relationship with Russia's 
                    tennis leader Yevgeny Kafelnikov, rushed to announce the advent 
                    of a new tsar on the throne of Russian tennis. And no matter 
                    how hard the doyen of tennis journalism, Oleg Spassky, tried 
                    to warn the writers not &quot;to rush in handing out places 
                    in the Tennischart of Ranks&quot; the temptation was too great. 
                    <br>
                    But then, Kafelnikov should be given his due. Shortly after 
                    Kafelnikov won the gold in Sydney (Safin had surprisingly 
                    lost in the first round) he said he had &quot;no envy whatsoever 
                    towards Marat ... We are witnessing a process which had to 
                    happen: young players are taking up the leading roles they 
                    must take. Yes, maybe I lent a helping hand in shaping him 
                    up as a sportsman when he was 18-19 years old, when we were 
                    playing our first Davis Cup tournament. Quite naturally, I 
                    was giving him advice as the team leader, as an old comrade 
                    of his.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    Moreover, Kafelnikov now feels relieved that he has a strong 
                    teammate on the Davis Cup national team, who can help him 
                    win the Davis Cup for Russia. &quot;I hope next year we will 
                    carry out this plan, because we have a really good team now,&quot; 
                    Kafelnikov said. &quot;Everything will depend on the specific 
                    sporting form we reach by the time we play ... I think if 
                    [Marat and I] play according to our capacities, no ot\her 
                    team can beat us.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    There is indeed a strong spirit of camaraderie established 
                    between the two Russian tennis stars-the first two Russians 
                    to ever make it to the top ten at the same time. And yet, 
                    despite this camaraderie, nothing in Safin reminds one of 
                    the first tsar of Russian tennis-- Kafelnikov. Unlike Kafelnikov, 
                    who stayed in a hotel in Sydney, Safin lodged in the Olympic 
                    Village. &quot;Zhenya is a family man and prefers solitude,&quot; 
                    Safin said. &quot;And I like the tusovka [get together]. We 
                    are people of different ages and interests. I have a different 
                    lifestyle. For instance, I like going to discos.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    On the night of his US Open victory, Safin was spotted at 
                    the posh NY restaurant, the Russian Tea Room. &quot;Sleep?!,&quot; 
                    Marat replied to an Izvestia correspondent in New York. &quot;Give 
                    me a break! What sleep?! We are cutting loose!&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    Safin's game matches his character. He likes to fight an open 
                    battle, fearlessly hitting the ball, not engaging in cool, 
                    calculating, chess-like thinking games. As Kafelnikov commented, 
                    this may be why it is easier for Safin to beat Sampras than 
                    the diminutive Frenchman Fabrice Santoro. Santoro specializes 
                    in drop shots and slices, anticipating Safin's every move; 
                    he now has a five match winning streak against Safin, which 
                    included Safin's first round defeat at Sydney. <br>
                    The Olympic loss was particularly hard on Safin. &quot;I couldn't 
                    help my country and I'm angry because I can't fight for the 
                    gold medal,&quot; he said at the time. Such sentiments resonated 
                    deeply back in Russia. Despite the fact that Safin spends 
                    most of his time abroad and has a Spanish girlfriend, he has 
                    a deep and abiding love for Russia and particularly for his 
                    hometown of Moscow. He said he loves to stroll Moscow with 
                    friends late at night or go to cheer on his favorite soccer 
                    club, Spartak. <br>
                    <br>
                    But foreign tennis fans and observers also seem taken by Safin. 
                    After the US Open, John McEnroe said that &quot;with such 
                    charm, such a nonchalant smile, this guy is twice as dangerous 
                    ... shortly he will eclipse Agassi if he continues this way 
                    ... Never before has a Russian tennis player been so interesting 
                    as a personality. And this is the most intriguing part ... 
                    Tennis has someone special and I hope it doesn't waste him.&quot;<br>
                    <br>
                    Indeed, stardom can waste a man. But so far Safin seems to 
                    be handling the spotlight well. Through many press conferences, 
                    Safin has never snubbed a colleague or refused an autograph. 
                    He is the same man in the top 10 as he was when he was just 
                    in the top 200. <br>
                    <br>
                    Yevgeny Fedyakov, one of Russia's leading tennis observers 
                    from Sport-- Express concurred. &quot;In June 1998, shortly 
                    after his first sensational debut at the French Open, I remember 
                    how hard it was for him to cope with the sudden avalanche 
                    of fame ... Fame and attention weighed on him. Two years have 
                    passed. Safin already knows what he is worth. But he is still 
                    sincere-both on court and off. And this sincerity wins me 
                    over.&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    Fedyakov said he has not met a single person who would say 
                    he does not like Safin. &quot;And what's not to like? This 
                    20-- year-old guy earns his money through hard-and what is 
                    rare in our time-- honest work. He donated a few tens of thousands 
                    of dollars to the families of the sailors of the Kursk submarine. 
                    This was not because someone prompted him. It was simply because 
                    he was stunned by the tragedy.... I think people like Safin 
                    have the right to be the 2000 Generation. What Russia will 
                    become in the 21st century depends on this generation.&quot;
