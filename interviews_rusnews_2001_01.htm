                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <em>Last year was pleasantly surprising for Russian tennis 
                    player Marat Safin but this year, the season started badly 
                    for him. On the tournament in Dubai he got a back injury. 
                    But apart from that, Marat is one of the race leaders being 
                    2nd in the entry system. </em><br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q- Marat, after your poor performance in Bratislava, you promised 
                    to make up for it in Sweden. Don't you have the feeling that 
                    you took your Davis Cup team for a ride?<br>
                    <br>
                    M- Of course I wish I could have shown them what I'm capable 
                    of. Normally I can defeat the Swedes. But professionals don't 
                    ask for their injuries. Most of all I lost a lot of money 
                    and ranking points because of it. Everybody can see I'm injured 
                    and my opponents want to beat me, want to finish me off, want 
                    to crush me psychologically. In these cases you have to think 
                    about your future, not force the situation, and wait until 
                    you are totally healthy. That's why, unfortunately, I had 
                    to refuse to play Davis Cup. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q- Some people say that you lack tact/patriotism. <br>
                    <br>
                    M- If their back hurt to the point that it was driving you 
                    up the wall, they wouldn't have said that stuff. <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    BUT VERY SEXUAL <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q- After you said in your last interview for &quot;AIF&quot;, 
                    that you'd like to thank your (female) fans with chocolate 
                    medals bearing your face, many girls contacted us, saying 
                    they longed for such a present. Perhaps you should start a 
                    chocolate business? <br>
                    <br>
                    M- I concern myself with tennis, and at the moment I don't 
                    want to do anything else. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q- After the scandal, when Mike Tyson bit his opponents ear, 
                    in the USA a chocolate ear was put on the market. The boxer 
                    earned a lot of money from that. Wouldn't you like to put 
                    your heart, torso or some other chocolate body part on the 
                    market? <br>
                    <br>
                    M- No, I don't. When a sport idol gets into trouble abroad, 
                    then the people try to support him and get him out of his 
                    depression. But if you get in trouble in our country, the 
                    people try to hurt you even more. They write fairy tales about 
                    you. I can't understand it. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q- Do your female fans bother you? <br>
                    <br>
                    M- Associating with my fans is part of my job. But of course 
                    I would like to get some peace. When you can't concentrate 
                    totally on your tennis, sometimes it's really difficult to 
                    play.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q- If you look at the rankings, Russia is at the moment the 
                    strongest team, it's also called the &quot;Dream team&quot;. 
                    Would you say yes if somebody offered to clone you? And &quot;Double 
                    Safin&quot; would shine on the courts; <br>
                    <br>
                    M- I don't agree with that. In England they cloned Dolly the 
                    sheep, but had to kill her because of the foot-and-mouth disease. 
                    I'm sure that between the epidemics and scientific 'magic 
                    tricks' are some profound consequences. And besides, why should 
                    we experiment, if there is a much pleasanter, healthier and 
                    much more interesting way to breed? Everything should happen 
                    in a natural way. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q- Now, you are such a beautiful, strong, young man, would 
                    you consider being a sperm donor for a &quot;Sperm Bank&quot; 
                    and improving the Russian gene pool?<br>
                    <br>
                    M- You think I'm some kind of factory? I think there are many 
                    men in Russia who would like to sell their sperm for money. 
                    If I need a child, the girl I love will give birth to it.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q- Are you careful that nothing happens to you like it did 
                    to Boris Becker? Russian Angela Ermakova gave birth to his 
                    child and demanded $3 millions as a result. And Boris had 
                    to pay. <br>
                    <br>
                    M- Fortunately this hasn't happened to me. (He spits and knocks 
                    on a table). I try not to make mistakes, especially this kind, 
                    they're very expensive. And Becker is the best example of 
                    it.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q- You have come to glory like Vyisotzkiy (a Russian singer, 
                    actor &amp; poet) and embodied his phrase: &quot;Lots of women 
                    and lots of wine&quot;. Is this true? <br>
                    <br>
                    M- I think the people who think this up have no lives of their 
                    own. And by the way, I don't want to justify myself anymore. 
                    I'd like to see them go out on court and try to play after 
                    they've drunk all night, like they say I do. They would be 
                    in heaven already. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q- Sex and sport, is there a connection?<br>
                    <br>
                    M- Of course! First of all, the hormones are stimulated. Secondly, 
                    it removes the nervous excitement before a match. And I read 
                    somewhere, that when a person is very sexual then he's also 
                    very ingenious. <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    THE DIVA SYNDROME<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q- Marat, why did you have so much success last year, but 
                    only failure this year? <br>
                    <br>
                    M- Many tennis players have ups and downs. Let's take Agassi 
                    for example: he was number 1, but after that he wasn't even 
                    in the Top 100 anymore. In the last 5-7 years only Sampras 
                    and our Kafelnikov stayed in the Top 10. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q- At the beginning of last year you wanted to retire altogether 
                    from tennis. Do you still think about that? <br>
                    <br>
                    M- No. I've achieved a lot, and now I don't have to run after 
                    results or prove to people what I'm capable of. I'm satisfied 
                    with what I've achieved. I have my plans and my obligations 
                    to the ATP. I would like to win the French Open, if not this 
                    year, then next. But I will do it someday, definitely. I promise 
                    that I will be in the Top 10 for many years. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q- Is it hard to stay on top of such a strong performance 
                    and have so much glory?<br>
                    <br>
                    M- As the saying goes, you can't spend money on drink and 
                    still have a masterly performance. And about the glory - although 
                    it is a temporary thing, I don't worry about it, because I'm 
                    not a vain person. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q- Some people think that you get &quot;star fever&quot;. 
                    You can't control yourself, you become explosive: at the beginning 
                    of the year in Milan you broke 7 rackets in the locker room. 
                    Why do you do that ? - childishness, a surge of emotion? <br>
                    <br>
                    M- Ok, this crime happened. I was just very disappointed because 
                    of my incompetent loss. I know it's not the rackets fault. 
                    I'm old enough to understand and I criticize my actions. By 
                    the way, to connect my broken rackets with &quot;star fever&quot; 
                    - it's just unfair. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q- Some people also say: &quot;Safin is a star? He's, at most, 
                    a flash-in-the-pan&quot; <br>
                    <br>
                    M- It doesn't bother me what people say about me. If my behaviour 
                    doesn't please someone, let them be offended, let them curse 
                    me - it's their problem. I have the right to live my own life. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q- Undoubtedly, you believe, like the saying: &quot;it's my 
                    loo, I'll put it down where I want to&quot;. But after your 
                    victory over the great Sampras at the US Open, you've become 
                    the property of Russia, and you don't belong to yourself in 
                    some cases anymore.<br>
                    <br>
                    M- But I can't please all the people all of the time, and 
                    I can't be a role model for everyone. Life is short, and I 
                    want to live it the way I want. And by the way, I'm already 
                    tired of defending myself. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q- Why are so many people in Russia unfair towards you? <br>
                    <br>
                    M- I was given alot, and I achieved a lot. If they had worked 
                    as hard since the age of 6, like me, they'd understand. Perhaps 
                    they are jealous.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q- Is there a point when you will collect your thoughts and 
                    start winning again? <br>
                    <br>
                    M- It can happen in a week, a month, a year. Time will tell. 
                    I'm not in a rush, I'm not late. I think that everything will 
                    be ok someday. <br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    PROFESSOR OR SHOWMAN?<br>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Q- Apart from your injury, are there any other reasons why 
                    you are losing? <br>
                    <br>
                    M- Everyone, not only sportsmen, has ups and downs, but our 
                    downs are more noticeable because our lives are in public. 
                    It's just impossible to be on top all the time both physically 
                    and psychologically.<br>
                    <br>
                    Q- What percentage do you consider yourself professional? 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    M- You can't be 100% professional. You can strive for it, 
                    but to give your all for the game, in my mind, - it's a big 
                    mistake. It's just a game, it's not life. Also tennis players 
                    who get closer to the reputation of &quot;the perfect player&quot;, 
                    need freedom. For example Sampras: he's probably practising 
                    more than others, but Pete is not obsessed with tennis. Last 
                    year he preferred to celebrate his marriage and not take part 
                    in three big tournaments. The pleasures of his honeymoon and 
                    his new wife are more important for him then any honours and 
                    prizes in sport. It's a wonderful thing, a wonderful feeling, 
                    why should you rob yourself of this? Sampras did everything 
                    right, and I support and respect him. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q- Who else do you respect?<br>
                    <br>
                    M- We all respect Kafelnikov, he did a lot for tennis. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q- Marat, has anybody offered you a career in Hollywood? <br>
                    <br>
                    M- I'm not interested in it. And I just couldn't live in America. 
                    It's not for me. I'm not ready, not able and I wouldn't want 
                    to be an actor. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q- Anyhow, you said, that tennis is a big show. That means, 
                    you work in the entertainment business? <br>
                    <br>
                    M- Yes. And it's nothing special. When thousands of people 
                    come to the matches, then it's interesting for me to be a 
                    part of the show. <br>
                    <br>
                    Q- And is it interesting for you to entertain Luschkov, to 
                    practice with him, to play doubles with his wife - is this 
                    not also a clown show? <br>
                    <br>
                    M- What are you saying?! He's the mayor of Moscow, a city 
                    with a population of ten million people, you can count him 
                    as the head of the whole country. He must be supported, he 
                    really likes tennis. Why not play with him? I was really surprised, 
                    because our mayor is a very agile and athletic person. A few 
                    times he hammered the ball so well that even I couldn't return 
                    it. <br>
                    <br>
