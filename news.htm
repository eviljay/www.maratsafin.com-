                          injurie. Safin told tournament organizers that it would 
                          be at least three weeks until he was able to play again.<br>

                          played 14 consecutive Grand Slam tournaments dating 
                          back to the US Open in 1999 and 19 of 20 consecutive 
                          Grand Slams since joining the ATP circuit.<br>
                          Safin reached the final of Barcelona last month but 
                          has not played since losing in the first round of Valencia

                          </b> Injuries to Marat Safin and Mikhail Youzhny have 
                          forced Russia to pull out of next week's ATP World Team 
                          Championship in Dusseldorf, Germany.<br>
                          &quot;We had to withdraw from the world team championship 
                          because both Safin and Youzhny are nursing injuries,&quot; 
                          Russia's tennis chief Shamil Tarpishchev told Reuters 
                          on Thursday. &quot;That leaves us with Yevgeny Kafelnikov 
                          and Nikolay Davydenko, but they don't have enough ranking 
                          points to qualify us for the event.&quot;<br>
                          The week-long tournament in Dusseldorf involves the 
                          world's top eight tennis nations based on their players' 
                          ATP rankings. <br>
                          Tarpishchev said Youzhny, who lost to Argentine Guillermo 
                          Coria in the third round of the Masters Series tournament 
                          in Hamburg on Thursday, had aggravated a wrist injury. 
                      <br>
                          Safin, who was forced to miss the Hamburg tournament 
                          as well as last week's Rome Masters, is suffering from 
                          a nagging wrist injury and also has a problem with his 
                          leg.<br>
                          &quot;Safin's injury is more serious,&quot; Tarpishchev 
                          said, adding that the 2000 U.S. Open champion might 
                          even have to pull out of the French Open, which starts 
                          later this month.<br>
                          Safin and Youzhny led Russia to their first Davis Cup 
                          title with a dramatic 3-2 victory over holders France 
                          in the Paris final last December. Russia also finished 
                          second in last year's World Team championship, losing 
                          to Argentina in the final.<br>
                          Safin, 23, has had a turbulent year so far, battling 
                          with various injuries.<br>
                          The Russian injured his left wrist at the Australian 
                          Open in January, forcing him to withdraw from his third 
                          round tie against German Rainer Schuettler. <br>

                          with various injuries. <br>
Following a tight start to the match the Russian claimed 
                          the first break in the 11th game and and served out 
                          the set.<br>

                          final of the US$1.08 million Open Seat Godo. <br>
                          Safin, who won the tournament in 2000, was unstoppable. 
                          <br>
                          The match started evenly, with both players holding 
                          serve until the 10th game, which Ferrero opened by serving 
                          a double fault. He did the same thing at the end of 
                          the game, handing the fourth-seeded Safin the first 
                          set. <br>
                          Safin ran off five straight games in the second set. 
                          Ferrero, who won the tournament in 2001, came back to 
                          win three but Safin clinched it, ending the match with 
                          his 12th ace. <br>
                          Safin will play Carlos Moya, who defeated Agustin Calleri

                          of his serve to go down 0-2 in the second. But his determination 
                          pulled him through winning 5 consecutive games taking 
                          the win.<br>

                          </b> Former U.S. Open champion Marat Safin returned 
                          three weeks after an injury scare and defeated Spanish 
                          qualifier Salvador Navarro, 7-5, 6-2, on Tuesday to 
                          reach the third round of the $1.08 million Open Seat 
                          Godo.<br>
The 23-year-old Russian, who received a first-round 
                          bye as a top-eight seed, struggled in the first set 
                          but found traction in the second to defeat a man who 
                          beat him at a Challenger event six years ago. <br>
The fourth seed, Safin learned his tennis in Spain 
                          after being sent from Moscow as a teenager by his mother, 
                          who also was his coach. <br>

                          The brother of WTA Tour member Dinara Safina, Safin 
                          won the Barcelona title in 2000, the same year he claimed 
                          a Grand Slam trophy at Flushing Meadows with a win over 
                          Pete Sampras.<br>
Safin has not played since the Tennis Masters Series 
                          event in Miami, where he lost his opening match to Italian 
                          Davide Sanguinetti. He injured his ankle in Argentina 
                          before Russia's 5-0 Davis Cup loss three weeks ago. 
                       <br>
Navarro broke Safin to even the first set at 5-5, but 
                          Safin broke back, then saved four break points to win 
                          the set. He took the momentum to the second set, winning 
                          the first four games. <br>
&quot;The ankle is better,&quot; he said. &quot;It's 
                          been three weeks since I have played a match It's difficult 
                          to come back. You are lacking in confidence and you 
                          are scared to move around the court. <br>
&quot;When the match began, I was a little bit too 
                          nervous. After the first set, I began to build up my 
                          confidence and find my rhythm.&quot; <br>

                          a twisted right ankle will prevent him from playing 
                          singles in this weekend's tie. <br>
Unheralded Nikolay Davydenko replaces Safin in the 
                          starting singles lineup and will play Wimbledon finalist 
                          David Nalbandian in tomorrow's opening match on the 
                          red clay of the Club Atletico in Buenos Aires. Former 
                          French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov faces Argentina's 
                          Gaston Gaudio in tomorrow's second singles match. <br>
The eighth-ranked Safin sustained a twisted right ankle 
                          during his second-round loss to Italian Davide Sanguinetti 
                          at the Nasdaq-100 Open final on Key Biscayne two weeks 
                          ago. He reinjured his ankle while training for the tie 
                          earlier this week and while he plans to partner in Saturday's 
                          doubles with Kafelnikov against Lucas Arnold and Nalbandian, 
                          the 2000 U.S. Open champion has ruled himself out of 
                          singles.<br>
&quot;The injury is now better but I'm not in good 
                          shape and that's why I'm not playing,&quot; Safin said 
                          during today's press conference to announce the draw. 
                          &quot;But, in any case, I'll do everything I can to 
                          be in the team on the final day.&quot;<br>
The 21-year-old Davydenko has only two Davis Cup matches 
                          to his credit. Stepping in for Safin, who was out with 
                          a wrist injury in Russia's 3-2 victory over the Czech 
                          Republic in February's first-round tie, Davydenko lost 
                          to Jiri Novak in his Davis Cup debut before beating 
                          Radek Stepanek in his second match. <br>
Sunday's reverse singles will feature Kafelnikov vs. 
                          Nalbandian followed by Davydenko meeting Gaudio in the 
                          final match of the tie. Both team captains have up until 
                          10 minutes before the match to substitute singles starters 
                          and up to an hour before the match to change their doubles 
                          lineup. Even with a healthy Safin in the lineup, Russia 
                          was not necessarily the favorite to win the tie. Without 
                          Safin, Russia's chances of winning may be remote.<br>
&quot;We'll do everything possible to overcome these 
                          inconveniences and win,&quot; Kafelnikov said.<br>

                          Club Atletico River Plate, Buenos Aires, Argentina<br>
                          --------- <br>
                          This is the third meeting (first meeting in 1985 between 
                          ARG and RUS competing as USSR), between these two nations 
                          in Davis Cup and so far Argentina has yet to emerge 
                          victorious. The tie is also a rematch of last year's 
                          semifinal in Moscow, in which the Russians established 
                          a winning three rubbers to one lead before Argentina 
                          claimed the final dead rubber. The highlight of the 
                          tie, however, was the epic doubles rubber, won by the 
                          Argentine pair of Lucas Arnold and David Nalbandian 
                          19-17 in the fifth set after six hours 20 minutes. It 
                          was the longest match in Davis Cup since the introduction 
                          of the tie break in 1989, yet Marat Safin and David 
                          Nalbandian returned to the court the next day to contest 
                          the fourth rubber, which Safin won to send Russia to 
                          the final. That semifinal was played indoors on a medium-paced 
                          carpet, so Argentina will be hoping to exact revenge 
                          on its favoured clay courts at home this time around. 
                          There may not be any rubbers as close as that doubles 
                          in Moscow, but the tie looks finely balanced and could 
                          turn out to be the clash of the quarterfinals.<br>

                          victory to send the seventh-seeded Safin out of the

                          of the Grandstand court, the seventh-seeded Safin was 
                          engaged in a spirited practice session with Australian 
                          Open finalist Rainer Schuettler at the Nasdaq-100 Open. 
                       <br>
                          As a shirtless Schuettler launched strokes from behind 
                          the baseline, a sweat-soaked Safin stook at the net 
                          and blocked volleys back at the Indian Wells semifinalist. 
                          After several sharp volleys, Safin suddenly smashed 
                          a swinging forehand volley that blew by Schuettler before 
                          he had a chance to react. <br>
A sly smile crept across Safin's face as he nodded 
                          to Schuettler than smiled at the crowd that had gathered 
                          behind the fence to watch the practice and shoot photos 
                          of the former U.S. Open champion. <br>
                          Even when he's practicing, Safin can still draw a crowd.

                          out a 6-4, 6-3 second-round victory against Mark Philippoussis

Both withdrew Wednesday, joining the three men who 
                          pulled out Tuesday with the stomach virus. <br>
Todd Martin and women's defending champion Daniela

                          losses Tuesday. <br>
Tournament doctor Sam Reber said that since Monday, 
                          at least 11 players have complained of symptoms &quot;varying 
                          in severity.&quot; <br>
&quot;Some have been able to continue playing, and 
                          some have had symptoms that have forced them to withdraw,&quot; 
                          Reber said. <br>
The illness, Reber said, appears to be flu-related 
                          and not food-related illness.<br>
It is short-lived, he said. <br>
&quot;They have their symptoms that seem to disappear 
                          within about 24 hours, and then they are left with a 
                          weakness after that. <br>
But (they) recover fairly quickly,&quot; he said. <br>
Safin, who was up much of the previous night with nausea 
                          and a fever.<br>
He said that he thought it was food poisoning. <br>
&quot;I was actually very sick last night,&quot; he 
                          said. <br>
&quot;I took some antibiotics. I'm feeling like a little 
                          bit weak, but I just try to stay focused and try to 
                          finish, try to play a little faster, stay calm and try 
                          to concentrate from the first point, just play my game. 
                       <br>
&quot;I was successful,&quot; Safin added. <br>

                          to squeeze the life out of his racquet. <br>
Instead, the towering Russian released his hold on 
                          his racquet with an exasperated exhale. It was then 
                          that Safin finally got a grip on his game and took control 
                          of the match. Winning six of the final seven games, 
                          Safin stormed back to win 12 straight points in his 
                          final three service games and score a 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 
                          victory to advance to the second round.<br>
The climb back from a deep deficit began with a Safin 
                          slide. Skidding across the court like a skateboarder 
                          shredding skin on a fall down a hill, Safin received 
                          treatment for his left foot from trainer Doug Spreen 
                          and used the break to mentally regroup. <br>
Holding serve in the sixth in the game, Safin closed 
                          to 3-4 when Koubek surrendered serve by firing two consecutive 
                          forehands wide. A focused Safin held serve at love on 
                          the strength of three aces and a service winner to even 
                          the set at 4-4. Koubek was down 0-30 in the ensuing 
                          game, but held for 5-4. <br>
Strong serving saw Safin hold at love again with another 
                          ace to level the set at 5-5. In the 11th game, Koubek 
                          fought off a pair of break points at 15-40, but blasted 
                          a backhand long to end one of the longest rallies of 
                          the match and give Safin another break point. A loud 
                          noise outside the stadium could be heard in the midst 
                          of the rally, but play continued. Koubek unsuccessfully 
                          argued the noise was a distraction and his concentration 
                          seemed to crack as he hit a forehand long to drop serve 
                          and hand Safin a 6-5 lead.<br>
A confident Safin closed out the match at love to survive 
                          the closely-contested match.<br>

                          </b> Russian Marat Safin has suffered a shock second 
                          round defeat to Spain's Tommy Robredo at the Dubai Open, 
                          losing 7-5 4-6 7-6 in a marathon lasting two hours and 
                          51 minutes. <br>
Robredo, who had not won a match in his previous four 
                          tournaments until his first round elimination of Sweden's 
                          Jonas Bjorkman, broke the second seed's serve to take 
                          the first set. <br>
Safin levelled the match by breaking early in the second, 
                          and the final set remained in the balance right to the 
                          end.<br>
The Russian twice held break points to serve for victory, 
                          at 4-4 and 5-5, and then twice had to serve to stay 
                          in the match, at 4-5 and 5-6.<br>
However, it was Robredo who proved the stronger player 
                          in the tiebreak, winning through 7-3. <br>

                          </b> Tuesday at the Dubai Tennis Championships , Marat 
                          Safin made it through his first round match. Safin won 
                          decisively in one of the shorter matches of the day, 
                          defeating Alexander Waske 6-4, 6-2 in just over an hour.<br>
                          Safin:&quot; It&#8217;s tough to play well. I was injured 
                          for three weeks and I started to play last week in Rotterdam. 
                          It&#8217;s really important to win titles at the beginning 
                          of the year so I can have a lot of confidence and fight 
                          for No. 1. People are already winning points and are 
                          already maybe a little bit too far (away) for me, but 
                          I hope I can get them. Winning titles and getting to 
                          the top ten of the Race means I can fight for No. 1.&quot;

                          </b> Former tennis journeyman Denis Golovanov has landed 
                          one of the most unenviable jobs in the sport - to tame 
                          his temperamental fellow Russian Marat Safin. Safin's 
                          fragile temperament has come under the microscope in 
                          the past as he often erupts when things are not going 
                          according to plan - breaking rackets for fun.<br>
                          It takes a strong willed person to stand up to Safin 
                          and the world number seven believes Golovanov has the 
                          ideal credentials to be his coach since he &quot;knows 
                          the way I think&quot;.<br>
&quot;You have to understand tennis but you also have 
                          to understand the personality of the player,&quot; said 
                          Safin, who overcame Belgium's Xavier Malisse 7-5 6-3 
                          in the first round of the World Indoor Tournament on 
                          Wednesday after being sidelined for a month with a wrist 
                          injury. <br>
&quot;He knows me really well, we've known each other 
                          for 11 years so he knows what kind of person I am and 
                          what I need and what I want.&quot; <br>
Safin has wasted little time in terminating the services 
                          of the numerous coaches he has hired over the years. 
                     <br>
In fact, the fiery Russian has worked with five different 
                          coaches, including Switzerland's Marc Rosset, over the 
                          past three seasons. <br>
Having employed Golovanov after the Paris Masters last 
                          year, Safin said: &quot;It's usually difficult when 
                          you hire a new coach as it takes two or three months 
                          to get to know each other...and to see if you like each 
                          other. You need a person to trust and I trust him.&quot; 
                       <br>
Golovanov has certainly had his work cut out with his 
                          new charge over the past six weeks.<br>
Safin, who admits to being &quot;not a very patient 
                          person&quot; has suffered both shoulder and wrist injuries 
                          since the new season started, which have severely curtailed 
                          his on court activities. <br>
But after spending five years on the brutal lower tier 
                          challenger circuit, the 23-year-old Golovanov is well 
                          aware of the frustrations that go with the sport. <br>
&quot;I helped him (Golovanov) at the beginning of 
                          his career with some money but he found it difficult 
                          to travel on the tour by himself,&quot; said the 2000 
                          U.S. Open champion. <br>
&quot;So I suggested why not come with me.&quot;

                          following a one-month injury layoff and came up victorious 
                          in his test against talented Belgian Xavier Malisse 
                          in the first round of the ABN AMRO World Tennis Tournament 
                          in Rotterdam Wednesday. Safin had shoulder problems 
                          forcing him to withdraw at the adidas International 
                          in Sydney last month and then had to pull out of the 
                          2003 Australian Open when he suffered a small tear in 
                          his wrist ligaments. With both losses coming as a result 
                          of withdrawal, Safin is technically undefeated on the 
                          year at 5-0. Safin, who reached the semifinals in Rotterdam 
                          in 1999, but has gone 1-3 the past three years, now 
                          meets veteran countryman Yevgeny Kafelnikov in the second 
                          round.<br>
                          Marat Safin: &quot;It's frustrating when you want to 
                          play but can't. I didn't touch a racket for three weeks 
                          and when I started playing again last week, I still 
                          felt some pain in my wrist.&quot; <br>
                          &quot;It's always difficult to play that first match 
                          but it (the wrist) was okay today so hopefully I won't 
                          have any more problems during the rest of the year.&quot; 
                          <br>
                          &quot;Everyone knows that I don't want to lose to him 
                          (Kafelnikov) and he doesn't want to lose to me. It will 
                          be tough.&quot;<br>
                          The all-Russian second round between the veteran, Yevgeny 
                          Kafelnikov and the talent, Marat Safin. Early in his 
                          pro career, Marat Safin was mentored at one point by 
                          the older Russian, but today Safin carries the banner 
                          as Russia's top male singles player. The two haven't 
                          met this early in a tournament since they played in 
                          the second round at the Telecom Italia Masters on clay, 
                          when Kafelnikov emerged victorious. Since then they 
                          have played in the spotlight in the final of the President's

                          </b> Last year's Australian Open runner-up Marat Safin 
                          has withdrawn from the Australian Open with a wrist 
                          injury. <br>
                          The third seed was due to play Germany's Rainer Schuettler 
                          in a third-round match on Saturday, but was forced to 
                          default the match. <br>
                          He told a news conference that he had torn ligaments 
                          in his left wrist when he fell during his first-round 
                          win over Raemon Sluiter. <br>
                          &quot;In my first match I fell down and felt some pain 
                          and in the second match (against Albert Montanes) I 
                          had an injection which is why I didn't feel anything,&quot; 
                          he said. <br>
                          &quot;It's a small cut in the ligament and the doctors 
                          said it would take about two to three weeks to heal. 
                          <br>
                          &quot;I will have ice and laser treatment for the wrist 
                          injury, but it basically needs rest.&quot; <br>
                          The 22-year-old had been troubled by shoulder and back 
                          problems since arriving in Australia. <br>
                          He withdrew from the Sydney International last week 
                          with an injured right shoulder, diagnosed as inflammation 
                          of the rotator cuff. <br>
                          Safin said that the injury-enforced break would be a 
                          welcome relief after having only a few weeks to recover 
                          from Russia's epic Davis Cup final win over France in 
                          December. <br>
                          The Russian has been one of a number of players advocating 
                          changes to the tennis calendar, saying the break between 
                          seasons was too short and was contributing to injuries. 
                          <br>
                          A number of top players, including defending champion 
                          Thomas Johannson, pulled out of the Australian Open 
                          before it began with niggling injuries. <br>
                          &quot;Everyone's trying to play too many tournaments 
                          and because the level of tennis is so high the bodies 
                          of the players cannot take it,&quot; Safin said. <br>
                          &quot;Every time you play you need two or three weeks 
                          off because the body is getting tired really fast. We 
                          don't have a rest at all now, so it's difficult.&quot;

                          </b> Third seed Marat Safin warned his rivals that he 
                          was saving himself for the second week of the Australian 
                          Open after his second-round 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-1 victory 
                          over Spain's Albert Montanes yesterday. <br>
The big Russian, runner-up in Melbourne last year, 
                          missed last week's Sydney International with a shoulder 
                          injury but said he would be at full throttle for his 
                          third-round match against Germany's Rainer Schuettler. 
                       <br>
&quot;I was trying to throw the ball in the right spot 
                          so I didn't [hurt] my shoulder that much,&quot; said 
                          Safin, who is still using anti-inflammatory drugs to 
                          help with the pain. &quot;I am trying to use less power 
                          and less energy to be ready for the second week.&quot; 
                      <br>
The 2000 US Open champion committed 53 unforced errors 
                          and was given a warning for racquet abuse in a patchy 
                          display on Rod Laver Arena. <br>
But after that moment of frustration early in the third 
                          set, Safin began to find his range from the baseline. 
                      <br>
He broke the 81st-ranked Montanes soon after and took 
                          the third set before rushing through the fourth to wrap 
                          up the match in two hours and 10 minutes. <br>
&quot;The [shoulder] pain is going away completely. 
                          Hopefully by the next match it will be perfect,&quot; 
                          Safin said. <br>
His third-round opponent Schuettler, the No 31 seed, 
                          defeated Dutch former Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek 
                          6-3, 7-5, 6-4. <br>
&quot;Schuettler beat Krajicek, so he is playing really 
                          good. Every match is going to be tough but I'm on my 
                          way,&quot; Safin said. <br>
Safin said he was not concerned about the hot form 
                          of Andre Agassi. &quot;I don't really worry about him. 
                          He is in great form and is physically strong. He came 
                          here with his family, so he has to do well,&quot; he 
                          joked. &quot;But let's see what happens in the second 
                          week. You can't judge people on just two matches. Other 
                          players can get better in the second week and get more 
                          dangerous.&quot; <br>

                          </b> Marat Safin overcame the loss of a set to quell 
                          the challenge of canny Dutchman Raemon Sluiter at the 
                          Australian Open. <br>
The Russian came into the tournament with a doubt about 
                          his fitness after withdrawing from his last event with 
                          a shoulder injury. <br>
The injury appeared not to trouble him - although his 
                          opponent did. <br>
Safin took the first set comfortably but Sluiter's 
                          clever shotmaking had the third seed struggling in the 
                          second set and the Dutchman levelled it. <br>
However, last year's finalist rediscovered his form 
                          and won through 6-4 4-6 6-3 6-4. <br>

                          </b> Marat Safin says blood testing for the banned performance-enhancing 
                          substance EPO is invasive and unnecessary, and that 
                          players weren't properly consulted about its introduction 
                          in tennis. <br>
Blood testing for EPO -- short for erythropoieten -- 
                          is expected to be conducted for the first time at a 
                          Grand Slam tennis tournament starting next week at the 
                          Australian Open. <br>
Safin, a finalist at Melbourne Park last year, said 
                          there was already enough drug testing and that EPO wasn't 
                          a big issue in tennis. <br>
"We go for too much. First of all, we have to go for 
                          the urine testing, now we have to go to EPO -- I said 
                          to the ATP that I don't think it's correct, but they 
                          really didn't listen,'' Safin said after withdrawing 
                          from the Adidas International on Thursday with a shoulder 
                          problem. <br>
The former U.S. Open champion said some people were 
                          afraid of needles, others could object on cultural or 
                          religious grounds. He said fellow Russian Yevgeny Kafelnikov 
                          was one of the people who doesn't a needle put into 
                          his vein. <br>
"Not every person can take it, easily,'' Safin said. 
                          "Some people, they get dizzy afterward.'' <br>
The Australian Sports Drug Agency, which can be commissioned 
                          to conduct EPO tests throughout Australia, said only 
                          10-12 milliliters (less than half a fluid ounce) of 
                          blood is taken in a dual-test format, which also involves 
                          a urine test. <br>
An Australian Open official said it was agreed in principle 
                          that blood-testing could be conducted at Melbourne Park. 
                          However, he said the blood tests were supposed to be 
                          random and, so, wouldn't necessarily start at the Australian 
                          Open from Jan. 13-16. <br>
Safin said tennis players didn't need endurance-enhancing 
                          drugs due to the nature of the sport. <br>
"I'm sure that nobody needs to take any drugs to be 
                          able to play on the court,'' he said. "It's not the 
                          kind of sport like cycling, for example, where you have 
                          to go to the mountains for six hours. It's one hour 
                          and a half of tennis, it's not so much.'' <br>
Safin seems to be in a minority of players who oppose 
                          the blood tests. <br>

                          from the Sydney International on Thursday, prompting 
                          fears that the Russian may not be fit for next week's 
                          Australian Open. <br>
                          Safin was due to meet Korean qualifier Lee Hyung-taik

                          medical advice because of problems with his serving 
                          shoulder. <br>
&quot;It hurts and I cannot serve, there's a lot of 
                          pain,&quot; Safin said. <br>
&quot;(The doctor) said it's quite serious and it was 
                          better to stop right now.&quot; <br>
Safin said he still expected to play in the Australian 
                          Open, which starts on Monday, but would ask officials 
                          for a late start to give him as much time as possible 
                          to recover. <br>
He said he would fly to Melbourne on Thursday night 
                          to receive treatment and was prepared to play with painkillers 
                          to get him through the first few rounds. <br>
&quot;I need to stop for a few days but I hope I will 
                          be okay, I'm not sure but there is a chance,&quot; he 
                          said. <br>
&quot;I can play forehand, backhand, anything, expect 
                          serve. <br>
&quot;I'll be okay but I'll ask for a late start and

                          was overhitting, mucking up volleys, but he won anyway. 
                          Comfortably, but not quickly, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2 over Finland's 
                          Jarkko Nieminen. <br>
On centre court Safin's sweat made his shirt transparent, 
                          the heat made his skin pink and relief was obvious on 
                          his face when, after one hour and 31 minutes, game, 
                          set, match was called. <br>
&quot;It's the atmosphere, it's just so hot. Your muscles, 
                          you are quite slow on the court,&quot; Safin said afterwards. 
                          &quot;When it's not so warm you can think. But here, 
                          you just want to finish the point quickly and you want 
                          to get out of the court. <br>
&quot;To run for the long points, it's difficult. That's 
                          why you try to make them quick.&quot; <br>
Safin shuffled through to the quarter-finals at the 
                          adidas International at Homebush Bay with an unglamorous 
                          win. He made 43 unforced errors - 10 more than his opponent. 
                          <br>
                          Safin's massive first serve also suffered in the heat. 
                          He could land only 53 per cent of first serves in, but 
                          he still managed seven aces. <br>
Safin said it was worth flogging himself in the harsh 
                          conditions because when he took the court for the Australian 
                          Open next week he would be well-prepared in the event 
                          of sweltering conditions. <br>
&quot;It's good conditions to practise, the heat, windy. 
                          So it can't be any worse,&quot; he said. &quot;I think 
                          it's a great way for practice. <br>
                          &quot;It was one of the hottest conditions I've played 
                          in I think. Maybe Cincinnati, it's also difficult to 
                          play.&quot; <br>
After the match Safin found an air conditioner to cool 
                          down and later a cool shower. He stayed inside, &quot;chilled 
                          out&quot;, before a doubles match prolonged Safin's 
                          pain. Just for a short moment. <br>
As a precautionary measure, Safin retired from his 
                          match with Nenad Zimonjic against Thomas Shimada and 
                          Paradorn Srichaphan because of tendonitis in his right 
                          shoulder. <br>

                          </b> It's hot, windy, the players are experiencing niggling 
                          injuries and grumbling about the lack of time off between 
                          seasons on the men's tennis circuit. <br>
                          The season-opening Grand Slam tournament - the Australian 
                          Open - starts next week in Melbourne. <br>
Marat Safin, losing finalist in the Australian Open 
                          last year, said he hadn't had enough time off after 
                          helping Russia win the Davis Cup last month. <br>
                          Rubbing the tender spots on his back Tuesday after a 
                          6-1, 6-4 win over Belgian Olivier Rochus at the Sydney 
                          International, Safin said he'd be picking and choosing 
                          his tournaments in 2003. <br>
Safin said many of his colleagues were dissatisfied 
                          with the short break between seasons on the pro tennis 
                          circuit. <br>
&quot;We have the shortest vacations in any sport,&quot; 
                          the 22-year-old Russian said. &quot;Every other sport 
                          ... they have enough time to recover, to have vacations 
                          with family and then just to prepare for the next season. 
                       <br>
&quot;We have nothing. Last year I had two weeks of 
                          vacation. There is no time to do something - if you 
                          want to fly somewhere to have vacations, just you can 
                          spend like 10 days somewhere.&quot; <br>
Safin had a 56-26 record in singles in 2002 and finished 
                          the year at No. 3, collecting more than US$1.7 million 
                          in prizemoney to push his career total above US$8.4 
                          million. <br>
He had a later end to the year than most, losing all 
                          three group matches in the exclusive, season-ending 
                          Tennis Masters Cup at Shanghai in November and then 
                          helping Russia to a 3-2 win over France in the Davis 
                          Cup final in Paris. <br>
He spent a month in Moscow after that, including two 
                          weeks of practice. <br>
Safin said he couldn't relax but he couldn't party 
                          too hard either because Russia was celebrating the Davis 
                          Cup triumph and he had to be on the ball for all his 
                          official engagements. He didn't think it appropriate 
                          to meet the Russian president with the &quot;smell of 
                          alcohol on your mouth.&quot; <br>
The former U.S. Open champion was back at work in Sydney, 
                          preparing for the Jan. 13-26 Australian Open, but said 
                          he'd skip the tournaments he didn't like this season.

                          to mature, which will help with his concentration and 
                          chances of improving on last year's runners-up placing 
                          in the Australian Open. <br>
                          &quot;My problem is not a tennis thing. It is mentally. 
                          Sometimes my concentration goes away in the game and 
                          it is difficult (to get it) to come back,&quot; Safin 
                          told reporters in Sydney on Monday. <br>
                          &quot;That's why I am suffering sometimes. I understand 
                          this, I know what I have to do but it is really, really 
                          tough to bring myself to this level. <br>
                          &quot;I'm trying and I'm trying and I'm growing up. 
                          I'm going to be 23 soon and I'm hoping that I'll manage 
                          to bring this level to my game.&quot; <br>
                          The Russian, who has a birthday on January 27, starts 
                          his campaign for the year's first grand slam tournament, 
                          which begins in Melbourne on January 13, with a match 
                          on Tuesday at the Sydney International tournament against 
                          Olivier Rochus.<br>
                          Rochus, the world number 64, beat the Russian in the 
                          second round at Wimbledon last year, where Safin was 
                          the second seed. <br>
                          Safin, who lost the Australian Open final to Sweden's 
                          Thomas Johnansson last January, while concerned with 
                          his own game said he is not the only top player without 
                          an all-round game. <br>
                          &quot;Everybody has something but is missing something,&quot; 
                          Safin said. <br>
                          &quot;(Australia's world number one) Lleyton Hewitt 
                          is an unbelievable fighter but he doesn't have big strokes. 
                          He doesn't have an unbelievable serve, unbelievable 
                          forehand and backhand. <br>
                          &quot;(Former world number one Pete) Sampras has an 
                          unbelievable forehand, but he is not really good on 
                          backhand. <br>
                          &quot;There is not one player who has everything. It's 
                          impossible.<br>
                          &quot;Take (world number two Andre) Agassi. He's an 
                          unbelievable baseline player, but he's not good at the 
                          net. He knows that everybody knows he has no clue at 
                          the net. <br>
                          &quot;Take anybody you want ... I have my problems also.&quot;<br>
                          Safin said of his match against Rochus: &quot;It's a 
                          great chance for revenge. It was not my best match at 
                          Wimbledon.&quot;<br>

                          </b>Marat Safin played great tennis in the final of 
                          the Davis Cup against France. It was because of him 
                          that Russia was able to win the coveted trophy for the 
                          first time. The 22 year old won both his singles matches 
                          by producing some awesome power; the second one leveling 
                          the final that kept Russia&#8217;s hopes alive.<br>
Safin will now take a break from tennis and recharge 
                          his batteries for the adidas International, 5 to 11 
                          January. The big Russian spearheads a tremendous field 
                          that will take to the courts at the Sydney International 
                          Tennis Centre at Sydney Olympic Park.<br>
&quot;The year is finished and I was waiting for that 
                          so badly but I also wanted to finish the year with a 
                          good match and I played it,&quot; said Safin. &quot;Now 
                          I can go for vacations, watch television and be relaxed 
                          for a couple of weeks. Then I will get ready for next 
                          year. It was important to finish the year with good 
                          wins to give a good feeling for next year.&quot;<br>
Safin is regarded as one of the most colourful players 
                          in men's tennis and his numerous responses in media 
                          conferences won him the &quot;ASAP Most Quotable Player 
                          Award&quot; by the International Tennis Writers Association 
                          last year. He is a winner of eleven career titles, the 
                          most recent one being the BNP Paribas Masters at Bercy 
                          in Paris, the same venue that hosted the Davis Cup final. 
                          In 2002 he was also a finalist at the Australian Open 
                          and a semifinalist at the French Open.<br>
At 1.93m, he is one of the tallest players on the tour 
                          and his incredible reach makes it very difficult to 
                          pass him. <br>
He speaks fluent Russian, English and Spanish having 
                          grown up in Spain where he developed his tennis skills. 
                          Marat was named after Jean Paul Marat the French revolutionary 
                          who died in 1793.<br>
Safin will end the 2002 season ranked three in the 
                          world.<br>
The Moscovite who resides in Monte Carlo, will be joined 
                          at the adidas International by four other players who 
                          qualified for the recent season-ending Tennis Masters

                          Ferrero, who was runner-up in Shanghai. Also in the

                          Chela, finalist at the 2002 adidas.<br>
